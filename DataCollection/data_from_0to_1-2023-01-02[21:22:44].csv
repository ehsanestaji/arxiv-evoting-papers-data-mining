0,PROVIDENCE: a Flexible Round-by-Round Risk-Limiting Audit,"A Risk-Limiting Audit (RLA) is a statistical election tabulation audit with a
rigorous error guarantee. We present ballot polling RLA PROVIDENCE, an audit
with the efficiency of MINERVA and flexibility of BRAVO. We prove that
PROVIDENCE is risk-limiting in the presence of an adversary who can choose
subsequent round sizes given knowledge of previous samples. We describe a
measure of audit workload as a function of the number of rounds, precincts
touched, and ballots drawn.We quantify the problem of obtaining a misleading
audit sample when rounds are too small, demonstrating the importance of the
resulting constraint on audit planning. We present simulation results
demonstrating the superiority of PROVIDENCE using these measures and describing
an approach to planning audit round schedules.
  We describe the use of PROVIDENCE by the Rhode Island Board of Elections in a
tabulation audit of the 2021 election. Our implementation of PROVIDENCE and
audit planning tools in the open source R2B2 library should be useful to the
states of Georgia and Pennsylvania, which are planning pre-certification ballot
polling RLAs for the 2022 general election.",2210.08717v1,['cs.CR'],2022-10-17 03:14:46+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Oliver Broadrick'), arxiv.Result.Author('Poorvi L. Vora'), arxiv.Result.Author('Filip Zag√≥rski')]"
1,Non(c)esuch Ballot-Level Risk-Limiting Audits for Precinct-Count Voting Systems,"Risk-limiting audits (RLAs) guarantee a high probability of correcting
incorrect reported outcomes before the outcomes are certified. The most
efficient use ballot-level comparison, comparing the voting system's
interpretation of individual ballot cards sampled at random (cast-vote records,
CVRs) from a trustworthy paper trail to a human interpretation of the same
cards. Such comparisons require the voting system to create and export CVRs in
a way that can be linked to the individual ballots the CVRs purport to
represent. Such links can be created by keeping the ballots in the order in
which they are scanned or by printing a unique serial number on each ballot.
But for precinct-count systems (PCOS), these strategies may compromise vote
anonymity: the order in which ballots are cast may identify the voters who cast
them. Printing a unique pseudo-random number (""cryptographic nonce"") on each
ballot card after the voter last touches it could reduce such privacy risks.
But what if the system does not in fact print a unique number on each ballot or
does not accurately report the numbers it printed? This paper gives two ways to
conduct an RLA so that even if the system does not print a genuine nonce on
each ballot or misreports the nonces it used, the audit's risk limit is not
compromised (however, the anonymity of votes might be compromised). One method
allows untrusted technology to be used to imprint and to retrieve ballot cards.
The method is adaptive: if the technology behaves properly, this protection
does not increase the audit workload. But if the imprinting or retrieval system
misbehaves, the sample size the RLA requires to confirm the reported results
when the results are correct is generally larger than if the imprinting and
retrieval were accurate.",2207.01362v1,"['cs.CR', 'stat.AP']",2022-07-04 12:35:42+00:00,[arxiv.Result.Author('Philip B. Stark')]
2,Conservative statistical post-election audits,"There are many sources of error in counting votes: the apparent winner might
not be the rightful winner. Hand tallies of the votes in a random sample of
precincts can be used to test the hypothesis that a full manual recount would
find a different outcome. This paper develops a conservative sequential test
based on the vote-counting errors found in a hand tally of a simple or
stratified random sample of precincts. The procedure includes a natural
escalation: If the hypothesis that the apparent outcome is incorrect is not
rejected at stage $s$, more precincts are audited. Eventually, either the
hypothesis is rejected--and the apparent outcome is confirmed--or all precincts
have been audited and the true outcome is known. The test uses a priori bounds
on the overstatement of the margin that could result from error in each
precinct. Such bounds can be derived from the reported counts in each precinct
and upper bounds on the number of votes cast in each precinct. The test allows
errors in different precincts to be treated differently to reflect voting
technology or precinct sizes. It is not optimal, but it is conservative: the
chance of erroneously confirming the outcome of a contest if a full manual
recount would show a different outcome is no larger than the nominal
significance level. The approach also gives a conservative $P$-value for the
hypothesis that a full manual recount would find a different outcome, given the
errors found in a fixed size sample. This is illustrated with two contests from
November, 2006: the U.S. Senate race in Minnesota and a school board race for
the Sausalito Marin City School District in California, a small contest in
which voters could vote for up to three candidates.",0807.4005v1,['stat.AP'],2008-07-25 06:54:40+00:00,[arxiv.Result.Author('Philip B. Stark')]
3,Decentralized Verifiable Mail-in Ballot Counting for Postal Voting,"As computer vision is prevalently used for mail-in ballot processing and
counting, it becomes a point of centralized trust in postal voting. We propose
DVote, a prototype system of postal voting that provides decentralized trust in
computer vision. With blockchain and layer-2 technologies, DVote decentralizes
the computation and model training of computer vision to a group of scrutineers
that hold the AnyTrust assumption, i.e., at least one member is honest.
Consequently, the computational integrity is anchored to the trustworthiness of
a large public blockchain such as Ethereum.",2202.09122v1,['cs.CR'],2022-02-18 11:00:10+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Peichen Xie'), arxiv.Result.Author('Zihan Zheng'), arxiv.Result.Author('Xian Zhang'), arxiv.Result.Author('Shuo Chen')]"
4,Physical Cryptographic Signatures for Absentee Ballots,"Physical signature verification on absentee ballots became a major flashpoint
in the 2018 midterm elections in the United States, especially in states like
Georgia, Florida, and Arizona, where close election margins resulted in
heightened attention to the counting of absentee ballots. As vote-by-mail
solutions are becoming more prevalent across the U.S., these issues are sure to
continue affecting elections in the United States. Signature verification is an
inexact science; often times guidelines can vary widely from jurisdiction to
jurisdiction. In this paper we provide a cryptographic remedy to this solution
that is usable, secure, and easily integrated into existing election
infrastructure.",1812.09423v1,['cs.CR'],2018-12-22 00:43:31+00:00,[arxiv.Result.Author('Matthew Bernhard')]
