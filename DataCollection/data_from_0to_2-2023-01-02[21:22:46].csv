0,PROVIDENCE: a Flexible Round-by-Round Risk-Limiting Audit,"A Risk-Limiting Audit (RLA) is a statistical election tabulation audit with a
rigorous error guarantee. We present ballot polling RLA PROVIDENCE, an audit
with the efficiency of MINERVA and flexibility of BRAVO. We prove that
PROVIDENCE is risk-limiting in the presence of an adversary who can choose
subsequent round sizes given knowledge of previous samples. We describe a
measure of audit workload as a function of the number of rounds, precincts
touched, and ballots drawn.We quantify the problem of obtaining a misleading
audit sample when rounds are too small, demonstrating the importance of the
resulting constraint on audit planning. We present simulation results
demonstrating the superiority of PROVIDENCE using these measures and describing
an approach to planning audit round schedules.
  We describe the use of PROVIDENCE by the Rhode Island Board of Elections in a
tabulation audit of the 2021 election. Our implementation of PROVIDENCE and
audit planning tools in the open source R2B2 library should be useful to the
states of Georgia and Pennsylvania, which are planning pre-certification ballot
polling RLAs for the 2022 general election.",2210.08717v1,['cs.CR'],2022-10-17 03:14:46+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Oliver Broadrick'), arxiv.Result.Author('Poorvi L. Vora'), arxiv.Result.Author('Filip Zagórski')]"
1,Non(c)esuch Ballot-Level Risk-Limiting Audits for Precinct-Count Voting Systems,"Risk-limiting audits (RLAs) guarantee a high probability of correcting
incorrect reported outcomes before the outcomes are certified. The most
efficient use ballot-level comparison, comparing the voting system's
interpretation of individual ballot cards sampled at random (cast-vote records,
CVRs) from a trustworthy paper trail to a human interpretation of the same
cards. Such comparisons require the voting system to create and export CVRs in
a way that can be linked to the individual ballots the CVRs purport to
represent. Such links can be created by keeping the ballots in the order in
which they are scanned or by printing a unique serial number on each ballot.
But for precinct-count systems (PCOS), these strategies may compromise vote
anonymity: the order in which ballots are cast may identify the voters who cast
them. Printing a unique pseudo-random number (""cryptographic nonce"") on each
ballot card after the voter last touches it could reduce such privacy risks.
But what if the system does not in fact print a unique number on each ballot or
does not accurately report the numbers it printed? This paper gives two ways to
conduct an RLA so that even if the system does not print a genuine nonce on
each ballot or misreports the nonces it used, the audit's risk limit is not
compromised (however, the anonymity of votes might be compromised). One method
allows untrusted technology to be used to imprint and to retrieve ballot cards.
The method is adaptive: if the technology behaves properly, this protection
does not increase the audit workload. But if the imprinting or retrieval system
misbehaves, the sample size the RLA requires to confirm the reported results
when the results are correct is generally larger than if the imprinting and
retrieval were accurate.",2207.01362v1,"['cs.CR', 'stat.AP']",2022-07-04 12:35:42+00:00,[arxiv.Result.Author('Philip B. Stark')]
2,Conservative statistical post-election audits,"There are many sources of error in counting votes: the apparent winner might
not be the rightful winner. Hand tallies of the votes in a random sample of
precincts can be used to test the hypothesis that a full manual recount would
find a different outcome. This paper develops a conservative sequential test
based on the vote-counting errors found in a hand tally of a simple or
stratified random sample of precincts. The procedure includes a natural
escalation: If the hypothesis that the apparent outcome is incorrect is not
rejected at stage $s$, more precincts are audited. Eventually, either the
hypothesis is rejected--and the apparent outcome is confirmed--or all precincts
have been audited and the true outcome is known. The test uses a priori bounds
on the overstatement of the margin that could result from error in each
precinct. Such bounds can be derived from the reported counts in each precinct
and upper bounds on the number of votes cast in each precinct. The test allows
errors in different precincts to be treated differently to reflect voting
technology or precinct sizes. It is not optimal, but it is conservative: the
chance of erroneously confirming the outcome of a contest if a full manual
recount would show a different outcome is no larger than the nominal
significance level. The approach also gives a conservative $P$-value for the
hypothesis that a full manual recount would find a different outcome, given the
errors found in a fixed size sample. This is illustrated with two contests from
November, 2006: the U.S. Senate race in Minnesota and a school board race for
the Sausalito Marin City School District in California, a small contest in
which voters could vote for up to three candidates.",0807.4005v1,['stat.AP'],2008-07-25 06:54:40+00:00,[arxiv.Result.Author('Philip B. Stark')]
3,Decentralized Verifiable Mail-in Ballot Counting for Postal Voting,"As computer vision is prevalently used for mail-in ballot processing and
counting, it becomes a point of centralized trust in postal voting. We propose
DVote, a prototype system of postal voting that provides decentralized trust in
computer vision. With blockchain and layer-2 technologies, DVote decentralizes
the computation and model training of computer vision to a group of scrutineers
that hold the AnyTrust assumption, i.e., at least one member is honest.
Consequently, the computational integrity is anchored to the trustworthiness of
a large public blockchain such as Ethereum.",2202.09122v1,['cs.CR'],2022-02-18 11:00:10+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Peichen Xie'), arxiv.Result.Author('Zihan Zheng'), arxiv.Result.Author('Xian Zhang'), arxiv.Result.Author('Shuo Chen')]"
4,Physical Cryptographic Signatures for Absentee Ballots,"Physical signature verification on absentee ballots became a major flashpoint
in the 2018 midterm elections in the United States, especially in states like
Georgia, Florida, and Arizona, where close election margins resulted in
heightened attention to the counting of absentee ballots. As vote-by-mail
solutions are becoming more prevalent across the U.S., these issues are sure to
continue affecting elections in the United States. Signature verification is an
inexact science; often times guidelines can vary widely from jurisdiction to
jurisdiction. In this paper we provide a cryptographic remedy to this solution
that is usable, secure, and easily integrated into existing election
infrastructure.",1812.09423v1,['cs.CR'],2018-12-22 00:43:31+00:00,[arxiv.Result.Author('Matthew Bernhard')]
5,Blind proxy voting,"A secret ballot mechanism that enables voting in absence is proposed. It
amends standard vote collection methods that use ballot box as anonymizer,
adding the option for absent voters to vote by a proxy blinded to the content
of the ballot paper. Votes are cast under unique and hidden identification
numbers generated solely for the purpose of that election. Voters prepare their
ballot papers from scratch and submit them to the tallying authority in two
parts via separate routes, each part being meaningless without the other.",1812.11128v1,['cs.CR'],2018-12-28 17:41:13+00:00,[arxiv.Result.Author('Zuzana Haniková')]
6,Limiting Risk by Turning Manifest Phantoms into Evil Zombies,"Drawing a random sample of ballots to conduct a risk-limiting audit generally
requires knowing how the ballots cast in an election are organized into groups,
for instance, how many containers of ballots there are in all and how many
ballots are in each container. A list of the ballot group identifiers along
with number of ballots in each group is called a ballot manifest. What if the
ballot manifest is not accurate? Surprisingly, even if ballots are known to be
missing from the manifest, it is not necessary to make worst-case assumptions
about those ballots--for instance, to adjust the margin by the number of
missing ballots--to ensure that the audit remains conservative. Rather, it
suffices to make worst-case assumptions about the individual randomly selected
ballots that the audit cannot find. This observation provides a simple
modification to some risk-limiting audit procedures that makes them
automatically become more conservative if the ballot manifest has errors. The
modification--phantoms to evil zombies (~2EZ)--requires only an upper bound on
the total number of ballots cast. ~2EZ makes the audit P-value stochastically
larger than it would be had the manifest been accurate, automatically requiring
more than enough ballots to be audited to offset the manifest errors. This
ensures that the true risk limit remains smaller than the nominal risk limit.
On the other hand, if the manifest is in fact accurate and the upper bound on
the total number of ballots equals the total according to the manifest, ~2EZ
has no effect at all on the number of ballots audited nor on the true risk
limit.",1207.3413v1,['stat.AP'],2012-07-14 11:26:02+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Jorge H. Banuelos'), arxiv.Result.Author('Philip B. Stark')]"
7,A Complete Enumeration of Ballot Permutations Avoiding Sets of Small Patterns,"Permutations whose prefixes contain at least as many ascents as descents are
called ballot permutations. Lin, Wang, and Zhao have previously enumerated
ballot permutations avoiding small patterns and have proposed the problem of
enumerating ballot permutations avoiding a pair of permutations of length $3$.
We completely enumerate ballot permutations avoiding two patterns of length $3$
and we relate these avoidance classes with their respective recurrence
relations and formulas, which leads to an interesting bijection between ballot
permutations avoiding $132$ and $312$ with left factors of Dyck paths. In
addition, we also conclude the Wilf-classification of ballot permutations
avoiding sets of two patterns of length $3$, and we then extend our results to
completely enumerate ballot permutations avoiding three patterns of length $3$.",2209.06087v1,"['math.CO', '05A05']",2022-09-13 15:37:45+00:00,[arxiv.Result.Author('Nathan Sun')]
8,Can Voters Detect Errors on Their Printed Ballots? Absolutely,"There is still debate on whether voters can detect malicious changes in their
printed ballot after making their selections on a Ballot Marking Device (BMD).
In this study, we altered votes on a voter's ballot after they had made their
selections on a BMD. We then required them to examine their ballots for any
changes from the slate they used to vote. Overall accuracy was exceptionally
high. Participants saw 1440 total contests, and of those 1440, there were a
total of 4 errors, so total accuracy was 99.8%. Participants were able to
perform with near-perfect accuracy regardless of ballot length, ballot type,
number of altered races, and location of altered races. Detection performance
was extremely robust. We conclude that with proper direction and resources,
voters can be near-perfect detectors of ballot changes on printed paper ballots
after voting with a BMD. This finding has significant implications for the
voting community as BMD use continues to grow. Research should now focus on
identifying administrative and behavioral methods that will prompt and
encourage voters to check their BMD-generated ballots before they drop them in
the ballot box.",2204.09780v1,"['cs.HC', 'cs.CR', 'H.1.2; J.4']",2022-04-20 20:40:32+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Philip Kortum'), arxiv.Result.Author('Michael D. Byrne'), arxiv.Result.Author('Chidera O. Azubike'), arxiv.Result.Author('Laura E. Roty')]"
9,Ballot tilings and increasing trees,"We study enumerations of Dyck and ballot tilings, which are tilings of a
region determined by two Dyck or ballot paths. We give bijective proofs to two
formulae of enumerations of Dyck tilings through Hermite histories. We show
that one of the formulae is equal to a certain Kazhdan--Lusztig polynomial. For
a ballot tiling, we establish formulae which are analogues of formulae for Dyck
tilings. Especially, the generating functions have factorized expressions. The
key tool is a planted plane tree and its increasing labellings. We also
introduce a generalized perfect matching which is bijective to an Hermite
history for a ballot tiling. By combining these objects, we obtain various
expressions of a generating function of ballot tilings with a fixed lower path.",1705.06434v1,"['math-ph', 'math.CO', 'math.MP']",2017-05-18 06:46:09+00:00,[arxiv.Result.Author('Keiichi Shigechi')]
