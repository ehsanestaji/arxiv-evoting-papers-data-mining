0,Physical Cryptographic Signatures for Absentee Ballots,"Physical signature verification on absentee ballots became a major flashpoint
in the 2018 midterm elections in the United States, especially in states like
Georgia, Florida, and Arizona, where close election margins resulted in
heightened attention to the counting of absentee ballots. As vote-by-mail
solutions are becoming more prevalent across the U.S., these issues are sure to
continue affecting elections in the United States. Signature verification is an
inexact science; often times guidelines can vary widely from jurisdiction to
jurisdiction. In this paper we provide a cryptographic remedy to this solution
that is usable, secure, and easily integrated into existing election
infrastructure.",1812.09423v1,cs.CR,2018-12-22 00:43:31+00:00,[arxiv.Result.Author('Matthew Bernhard')],
1,Identifying Possible Winners in Ranked Choice Voting Elections with Outstanding Ballots,"Several election districts in the US have recently moved to ranked-choice
voting (RCV) to decide the results of local elections. RCV allows voters to
rank their choices, and the results are computed in rounds, eliminating one
candidate at a time. RCV ensures fairer elections and has been shown to
increase elected representation of women and people of color. A main drawback
of RCV is that the round-by-round process requires all the ballots to be
tallied before the results of an election can be calculated. With increasingly
large portions of ballots coming from absentee voters, RCV election outcomes
are not always apparent on election night, and can take several weeks to be
published, leading to a loss of trust in the electoral process from the public.
In this paper, we present an algorithm for efficiently computing possible
winners of RCV elections from partially known ballots and evaluate it on data
from the recent New York City Primary elections. We show that our techniques
allow to significantly narrow down the field of possible election winners, and
in some case identify the winner as soon as election night despite a number of
yet-unaccounted absentee ballots, providing more transparency in the electoral
process.",2206.12741v1,cs.CY,2022-06-25 22:08:15+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Alborz Jelvani'), arxiv.Result.Author('Amélie Marian')]",
2,Blocks as geographic discontinuities: The effect of polling place assignment on voting,"A potential voter must incur a number of costs in order to successfully cast
an in-person ballot, including the costs associated with identifying and
traveling to a polling place. In order to investigate how these costs affect
voting behavior, we introduce two quasi-experimental designs that can be used
to study how the political participation of registered voters is affected by
differences in the relative distance that registrants must travel to their
assigned Election Day polling place and whether their polling place remains at
the same location as in a previous election. Our designs make comparisons of
registrants who live on the same residential block, but are assigned to vote at
different polling places. We find that living farther from a polling place and
being assigned to a new polling place reduce in-person Election Day voting, but
that registrants largely offset for this by casting more early in-person and
mail ballots.",2105.01728v1,stat.AP,2021-05-04 19:50:27+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Sabina Tomkins'), arxiv.Result.Author('Keniel Yao'), arxiv.Result.Author('Johann Gaebler'), arxiv.Result.Author('Tobias Konitzer'), arxiv.Result.Author('David Rothschild'), arxiv.Result.Author('Marc Meredith'), arxiv.Result.Author('Sharad Goel')]",
3,On Covering a Solid Sphere with Concentric Spheres in ${\mathbb Z}^3$,"We show that a digital sphere, constructed by the circular sweep of a digital
semicircle (generatrix) around its diameter, consists of some holes
(absentee-voxels), which appear on its spherical surface of revolution. This
incompleteness calls for a proper characterization of the absentee-voxels whose
restoration will yield a complete spherical surface without any holes. In this
paper, we present a characterization of such absentee-voxels using certain
techniques of digital geometry and show that their count varies quadratically
with the radius of the semicircular generatrix. Next, we design an algorithm to
fill these absentee-voxels so as to generate a spherical surface of revolution,
which is more realistic from the viewpoint of visual perception. We further
show that covering a solid sphere by a set of complete spheres also results in
an asymptotically larger count of absentees, which is cubic in the radius of
the sphere. The characterization and generation of complete solid spheres
without any holes can also be accomplished in a similar fashion. We furnish
test results to substantiate our theoretical findings.",1411.1395v1,cs.CG,2014-10-23 05:05:23+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Sahadev Bera'), arxiv.Result.Author('Partha Bhowmick'), arxiv.Result.Author('Bhargab B. Bhattacharya')]",
4,Limiting Risk by Turning Manifest Phantoms into Evil Zombies,"Drawing a random sample of ballots to conduct a risk-limiting audit generally
requires knowing how the ballots cast in an election are organized into groups,
for instance, how many containers of ballots there are in all and how many
ballots are in each container. A list of the ballot group identifiers along
with number of ballots in each group is called a ballot manifest. What if the
ballot manifest is not accurate? Surprisingly, even if ballots are known to be
missing from the manifest, it is not necessary to make worst-case assumptions
about those ballots--for instance, to adjust the margin by the number of
missing ballots--to ensure that the audit remains conservative. Rather, it
suffices to make worst-case assumptions about the individual randomly selected
ballots that the audit cannot find. This observation provides a simple
modification to some risk-limiting audit procedures that makes them
automatically become more conservative if the ballot manifest has errors. The
modification--phantoms to evil zombies (~2EZ)--requires only an upper bound on
the total number of ballots cast. ~2EZ makes the audit P-value stochastically
larger than it would be had the manifest been accurate, automatically requiring
more than enough ballots to be audited to offset the manifest errors. This
ensures that the true risk limit remains smaller than the nominal risk limit.
On the other hand, if the manifest is in fact accurate and the upper bound on
the total number of ballots equals the total according to the manifest, ~2EZ
has no effect at all on the number of ballots audited nor on the true risk
limit.",1207.3413v1,stat.AP,2012-07-14 11:26:02+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Jorge H. Banuelos'), arxiv.Result.Author('Philip B. Stark')]",
5,A Complete Enumeration of Ballot Permutations Avoiding Sets of Small Patterns,"Permutations whose prefixes contain at least as many ascents as descents are
called ballot permutations. Lin, Wang, and Zhao have previously enumerated
ballot permutations avoiding small patterns and have proposed the problem of
enumerating ballot permutations avoiding a pair of permutations of length $3$.
We completely enumerate ballot permutations avoiding two patterns of length $3$
and we relate these avoidance classes with their respective recurrence
relations and formulas, which leads to an interesting bijection between ballot
permutations avoiding $132$ and $312$ with left factors of Dyck paths. In
addition, we also conclude the Wilf-classification of ballot permutations
avoiding sets of two patterns of length $3$, and we then extend our results to
completely enumerate ballot permutations avoiding three patterns of length $3$.",2209.06087v1,math.CO,2022-09-13 15:37:45+00:00,[arxiv.Result.Author('Nathan Sun')],
6,Electt: running auditable and verifiable elections in untrusted environments,"We present a system for running auditable and verifiable elections in
untrusted environments. Votes are anonymous since the order of candidates on a
ballot sheet is random. Tellers see only the position of the candidate. Voters
can check their vote. An election is auditable using blockchain log.
Threshold-encryption, which is used to implement the quorum, prevents a
deadlock from occurring if a minority of candidates or observers tries to
sabotage the election. Candidates and observers can indicate that the election
was free and fair by exposing their keys, which are used by the system to
decrypt each vote. Ballot sheets are encrypted by onion-routing, which has a
layer with the key of the election instance, so it's impossible for a quorum to
decode the results before they have announced their decision by exposing their
keys. A register of voters ensures that only verified voters can vote without
compromising their identity. If there any doubts about the identity of a voter,
their vote can be excluded from the election, if a quorum agrees. This system
is designed to scale from one instance to a distributed system that runs over
an unlimited number of instances, which can be achieved using cloud instances
or smartphones belonging to voters or tellers.",2011.10902v2,cs.CR,2020-11-22 00:58:34+00:00,[arxiv.Result.Author('Kirill A. Korinsky')],
7,Can Voters Detect Errors on Their Printed Ballots? Absolutely,"There is still debate on whether voters can detect malicious changes in their
printed ballot after making their selections on a Ballot Marking Device (BMD).
In this study, we altered votes on a voter's ballot after they had made their
selections on a BMD. We then required them to examine their ballots for any
changes from the slate they used to vote. Overall accuracy was exceptionally
high. Participants saw 1440 total contests, and of those 1440, there were a
total of 4 errors, so total accuracy was 99.8%. Participants were able to
perform with near-perfect accuracy regardless of ballot length, ballot type,
number of altered races, and location of altered races. Detection performance
was extremely robust. We conclude that with proper direction and resources,
voters can be near-perfect detectors of ballot changes on printed paper ballots
after voting with a BMD. This finding has significant implications for the
voting community as BMD use continues to grow. Research should now focus on
identifying administrative and behavioral methods that will prompt and
encourage voters to check their BMD-generated ballots before they drop them in
the ballot box.",2204.09780v1,cs.HC,2022-04-20 20:40:32+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Philip Kortum'), arxiv.Result.Author('Michael D. Byrne'), arxiv.Result.Author('Chidera O. Azubike'), arxiv.Result.Author('Laura E. Roty')]",
8,Nurse Staffing under Absenteeism: A Distributionally Robust Optimization Approach,"We study the nurse staffing problem under random nurse demand and
absenteeism. While the demand uncertainty is exogenous (stemming from the
random patient census), the absenteeism uncertainty is \emph{endogenous}, i.e.,
the number of nurses who show up for work partially depends on the nurse
staffing level. For quality of care, many hospitals have developed float pools,
i.e., groups of hospital units, and trained nurses to be able to work in
multiple units (termed cross-training) in response to potential nurse shortage.
In this paper, we propose a distributionally robust nurse staffing (DRNS) model
that considers both exogenous and endogenous uncertainties. We derive a
separation algorithm to solve this model under a general structure of float
pools. In addition, we identify several pool structures that often arise in
practice and recast the corresponding DRNS model as a mixed-integer linear
program, which facilitates off-the-shelf commercial solvers. Furthermore, we
optimize the float pool design to reduce cross-training while achieving
specified target staffing costs. The numerical case studies, based on the data
of a collaborating hospital, suggest that the units with high absenteeism
probability should be pooled together.",1909.09875v2,math.OC,2019-09-21 19:15:54+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Minseok Ryu'), arxiv.Result.Author('Ruiwei Jiang')]",
9,On the Bee-Identification Error Exponent with Absentee Bees,"The ""bee-identification problem"" was formally defined by Tandon, Tan and
Varshney [IEEE Trans. Commun. (2019) [Online early access]], and the error
exponent was studied. This work extends the results for the ""absentee bees""
scenario, where a small fraction of the bees are absent in the beehive image
used for identification. For this setting, we present an exact characterization
of the bee-identification error exponent, and show that independent barcode
decoding is optimal, i.e., joint decoding of the bee barcodes does not result
in a better error exponent relative to independent decoding of each noisy
barcode. This is in contrast to the result without absentee bees, where joint
barcode decoding results in a significantly higher error exponent than
independent barcode decoding. We also define and characterize the ""capacity""
for the bee-identification problem with absentee bees, and prove the strong
converse for the same.",1910.10333v1,cs.IT,2019-10-23 03:57:35+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Anshoo Tandon'), arxiv.Result.Author('Vincent Y. F. Tan'), arxiv.Result.Author('Lav R. Varshney')]",
10,Ballot tilings and increasing trees,"We study enumerations of Dyck and ballot tilings, which are tilings of a
region determined by two Dyck or ballot paths. We give bijective proofs to two
formulae of enumerations of Dyck tilings through Hermite histories. We show
that one of the formulae is equal to a certain Kazhdan--Lusztig polynomial. For
a ballot tiling, we establish formulae which are analogues of formulae for Dyck
tilings. Especially, the generating functions have factorized expressions. The
key tool is a planted plane tree and its increasing labellings. We also
introduce a generalized perfect matching which is bijective to an Hermite
history for a ballot tiling. By combining these objects, we obtain various
expressions of a generating function of ballot tilings with a fixed lower path.",1705.06434v1,math-ph,2017-05-18 06:46:09+00:00,[arxiv.Result.Author('Keiichi Shigechi')],
11,Sophisticated Attacks on Decoy Ballots: The Devil's Menu and the Market for Lemons,"Decoy ballots do not count in election outcomes, but otherwise they are
indistinguishable from real ballots. By means of a game-theoretical model, we
show that decoy ballots may not provide effective protection against a
malevolent adversary trying to buy real ballots. If the citizenry is divided
into subgroups (or districts), the adversary can construct a so-called ""Devil's
Menu"" consisting of several prices. In equilibrium, the adversary can buy the
real ballots of any strict subset of districts at a price corresponding to the
willingness to sell on the part of the citizens holding such ballots. By
contrast, decoy voters are trapped into selling their ballots at a low, or even
negligible, price. Blowing up the adversary's budget by introducing decoy
ballots may thus turn out to be futile. The Devil's Menu can also be applied to
the well-known ""Lemons Problem"".",1712.05477v1,cs.GT,2017-12-14 23:54:58+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Hans Gersbach'), arxiv.Result.Author('Akaki Mamageishvili'), arxiv.Result.Author('Oriol Tejada')]",
12,The ATHENA Class of Risk-Limiting Ballot Polling Audits,"The main risk-limiting ballot polling audit in use today, BRAVO, is designed
for use when single ballots are drawn at random and a decision regarding
whether to stop the audit or draw another ballot is taken after each ballot
draw (ballot-by-ballot (B2) audits). On the other hand, real ballot polling
audits draw many ballots in a single round before determining whether to stop
(round-by-round (R2) audits). We show that BRAVO results in significant
inefficiency when directly applied to real R2 audits. We present the ATHENA
class of R2 stopping rules, which we show are risk-limiting if the round
schedule is pre-determined (before the audit begins). We prove that each rule
is at least as efficient as the corresponding BRAVO stopping rule applied at
the end of the round. We have open-source software libraries implementing most
of our results.
  We show that ATHENA halves the number of ballots required, for all state
margins in the 2016 US Presidential election and a first round with $90\%$
stopping probability, when compared to BRAVO (stopping rule applied at the end
of the round). We present simulation results supporting the 90% stopping
probability claims and our claims for the risk accrued in the first round.
Further, ATHENA reduces the number of ballots by more than a quarter for low
margins, when compared to the BRAVO stopping rule applied on ballots in
selection order. This implies that keeping track of the order when drawing
ballots R2 is not beneficial, because ATHENA is more efficient even without
information on selection order. These results are significant because current
approaches to real ballot polling election audits use the B2 BRAVO rules,
requiring about twice as much work on the part of election officials. Applying
the rules in selection order requires fewer ballots, but keeping track of the
order, and entering it into audit software, adds to the effort.",2008.02315v5,cs.CR,2020-08-05 18:47:37+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Filip Zagórski'), arxiv.Result.Author('Grant McClearn'), arxiv.Result.Author('Sarah Morin'), arxiv.Result.Author('Neal McBurnett'), arxiv.Result.Author('Poorvi L.

13,Integration of a machine learning model into a decision support tool to predict absenteeism at work of prospective employees,"Purpose - Inefficient hiring may result in lower productivity and higher
training costs. Productivity losses caused by absenteeism at work cost U.S.
employers billions of dollars each year. Also, employers typically spend a
considerable amount of time managing employees who perform poorly. The purpose
of this study is to develop a decision support tool to predict absenteeism
among potential employees. Design/methodology/approach - We utilized a popular
open-access dataset. In order to categorize absenteeism classes, the data have
been preprocessed, and four methods of machine learning classification have
been applied: Multinomial Logistic Regression (MLR), Support Vector Machines
(SVM), Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), and Random Forests (RF). We selected
the best model, based on several validation scores, and compared its
performance against the existing model; we then integrated the best model into
our proposed web-based for hiring managers. Findings - A web-based decision
tool allows hiring managers to make more informed decisions before hiring a
potential employee, thus reducing time, financial loss and reducing the
probability of economic insolvency. Originality/value - In this paper, we
propose a model that is trained based on attributes that can be collected
during the hiring process. Furthermore, hiring managers may lack experience in
machine learning or do not have the time to spend developing machine learning
algorithms. Thus, we propose a web-based interactive tool that can be used
without prior knowledge of machine learning algorithms.",2202.03577v1,cs.LG,2022-02-02 03:49:01+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Gopal Nath'), arxiv.Result.Author('Antoine Harfouche'), arxiv.Result.Author('Austin Coursey'), arxiv.Result.Author('Krishna K.

14,$k$-Cut: A Simple Approximately-Uniform Method for Sampling Ballots in Post-Election Audits,"We present an approximate sampling framework and discuss how risk-limiting

""risk-limiting"" properties. Our framework is general and can compensate for
counting mistakes made during audits.
  Moreover, we present and analyze a simple approximate sampling
method,""$k$-cut"", for picking a ballot randomly from a stack, without counting.
Our method involves doing $k$ ""cuts"", each involving moving a random portion of
ballots from the top to the bottom of the stack, and then picking the ballot on
top. Unlike conventional methods of picking a ballot at random, $k$-cut does
not require identification numbers on the ballots or counting many ballots per
draw. We analyze how close the distribution of chosen ballots is to the uniform
distribution, and design different mitigation procedures. We show that $k=6$
cuts is enough for an risk-limiting election audit, based on empirical data,
which would provide a significant increase in efficiency.",1811.08811v3,cs.DS,2018-11-21 16:26:33+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Mayuri Sridhar'), arxiv.Result.Author('Ronald L. Rivest')]",
15,Bernoulli Ballot Polling: A Manifest Improvement for Risk-Limiting Audits,"We present a method and software for ballot-polling risk-limiting audits

probability $p$, independently. Bernoulli sampling has several advantages: (1)
it does not require a ballot manifest; (2) it can be conducted independently at
different locations, rather than requiring a central authority to select the
sample from the whole population of cast ballots or requiring stratified
sampling; (3) it can start in polling places on election night, before margins
are known. If the reported margins for the 2016 U.S. Presidential election are
correct, a Bernoulli ballot-polling audit with a risk limit of 5% and a
sampling rate of $p_0 = 1\%$ would have had at least a 99% probability of
confirming the outcome in 42 states. (The other states were more likely to have
needed to examine additional ballots.) Logistical and security advantages that
auditing in the polling place affords may outweigh the cost of examining more
ballots than some other methods might require.",1812.06361v1,stat.AP,2018-12-15 21:57:23+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Kellie Ottoboni'), arxiv.Result.Author('Matthew Bernhard'), arxiv.Result.Author('J.

16,"Symmetric Dyck tilings, ballot tableaux and tree-like tableaux of shifted shapes","Symmetric Dyck tilings and ballot tilings are certain tilings in the region

which are bijective to symmetric Dyck tilings such as labeled trees, Hermite
histories, and perfect matchings. We also introduce two operations on labeled
trees for symmetric Dyck tilings: symmetric Dyck tiling strip (symDTS) and
symmetric Dyck tiling ribbon (symDTR). We give two definitions of Hermite
histories for symmetric Dyck tilings, and show that they are equivalent by use
of the correspondence between symDTS operation and an Hermite history. Since
ballot tilings form a subset in the set of symmetric Dyck tilings, we construct
an inclusive map from labeled trees for ballot tilings to labeled trees for
symmetric Dyck tilings. By this inclusive map, the results for symmetric Dyck
tilings can be applied to those of ballot tilings. We introduce and study the
notions of ballot tableaux and tree-like tableaux of shifted shapes, which are
generalizations of Dyck tableaux and tree-like tableaux, respectively. The
correspondence between ballot tableaux and tree-like tableaux of shifted shapes
is given by using the symDTR operation and the structure of labeled trees for

17,SOBA: Secrecy-preserving Observable Ballot-level Audit,"SOBA is an approach to election verification that provides observers with
justifiably high confidence that the reported results of an election are
consistent with an audit trail (""ballots""), which can be paper or electronic.
SOBA combines three ideas: (1) publishing cast vote records (CVRs) separately
for each contest, so that anyone can verify that each reported contest outcome
is correct, if the CVRs reflect voters' intentions with sufficient accuracy;
(2) shrouding a mapping between ballots and the CVRs for those ballots to
prevent the loss of privacy that could occur otherwise; (3) assessing the
accuracy with which the CVRs reflect voters' intentions for a collection of
contests while simultaneously assessing the integrity of the shrouded mapping
between ballots and CVRs by comparing randomly selected ballots to the CVRs
that purport to represent them. Step (1) is related to work by the Humboldt
County Election Transparency Project, but publishing CVRs separately for
individual contests rather than images of entire ballots preserves privacy.
Step (2) requires a cryptographic commitment from elections officials.
Observers participate in step (3), which relies on the ""super-simple
simultaneous single-ballot risk-limiting audit."" Step (3) is designed to reveal
relatively few ballots if the shrouded mapping is proper and the CVRs
accurately reflect voter intent. But if the reported outcomes of the contests
differ from the outcomes that a full hand count would show, step (3) is

hand, thereby limiting the risk that an incorrect outcome will become official

18,"Voter Verification of BMD Ballots Is a Two-Part Question: Can They? Mostly, They Can. Do They? Mostly, They Don't","The question of whether or not voters actually verify ballots produced by
ballot marking devices (BMDs) is presently the subject of some controversy.
Recent studies (e.g., Bernhard, et al. 2020) suggest the verification rate is
low. What is not clear from previous research is whether this is more a result
of voters being unable to do so accurately or whether this is because voters
simply choose not to attempt verification in the first place. In order to
understand this problem, we conducted an experiment in which 108 participants
participated in a mock election where the BMD displayed the voters' true
choices, but then changed a subset of those choices on the printed ballot. The
design of the printed ballot, the length of the ballot, the number of changes
that were made to the ballot, the location of those changes, and the
instructions provided to the voters were manipulated as part of the experiment.
Results indicated that of those voters who chose to examine the printed ballot,
76% detected anomalies, indicating that voters can reliably detect errors on
their ballot if they will simply review it. This suggests that administrative
remedies, rather than attempts to alter fundamental human perceptual

21,Identifying Possible Winners in Ranked Choice Voting Elections with Outstanding Ballots,"Several election districts in the US have recently moved to ranked-choice
voting (RCV) to decide the results of local elections. RCV allows voters to

large portions of ballots coming from absentee voters, RCV election outcomes
are not always apparent on election night, and can take several weeks to be

In this paper, we present an algorithm for efficiently computing possible
winners of RCV elections from partially known ballots and evaluate it on data
from the recent New York City Primary elections. We show that our techniques

missing ballots--to ensure that the audit remains conservative. Rather, it
suffices to make worst-case assumptions about the individual randomly selected
ballots that the audit cannot find. This observation provides a simple
modification to some risk-limiting audit procedures that makes them
automatically become more conservative if the ballot manifest has errors. The
modification--phantoms to evil zombies (~2EZ)--requires only an upper bound on
the total number of ballots cast. ~2EZ makes the audit P-value stochastically
larger than it would be had the manifest been accurate, automatically requiring
more than enough ballots to be audited to offset the manifest errors. This
ensures that the true risk limit remains smaller than the nominal risk limit.
On the other hand, if the manifest is in fact accurate and the upper bound on
the total number of ballots equals the total according to the manifest, ~2EZ
has no effect at all on the number of ballots audited nor on the true risk
limit.",1207.3413v1,stat.AP,2012-07-14 11:26:02+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Jorge H. Banuelos'), arxiv.Result.Author('Philip B. Stark')]",

ballot permutations avoiding small patterns and have proposed the problem of
enumerating ballot permutations avoiding a pair of permutations of length $3$.
We completely enumerate ballot permutations avoiding two patterns of length $3$

relations and formulas, which leads to an interesting bijection between ballot
permutations avoiding $132$ and $312$ with left factors of Dyck paths. In

25,Can Voters Detect Errors on Their Printed Ballots? Absolutely,"There is still debate on whether voters can detect malicious changes in their
printed ballot after making their selections on a Ballot Marking Device (BMD).
In this study, we altered votes on a voter's ballot after they had made their
selections on a BMD. We then required them to examine their ballots for any
changes from the slate they used to vote. Overall accuracy was exceptionally
high. Participants saw 1440 total contests, and of those 1440, there were a
total of 4 errors, so total accuracy was 99.8%. Participants were able to
perform with near-perfect accuracy regardless of ballot length, ballot type,
number of altered races, and location of altered races. Detection performance
was extremely robust. We conclude that with proper direction and resources,
voters can be near-perfect detectors of ballot changes on printed paper ballots
after voting with a BMD. This finding has significant implications for the
voting community as BMD use continues to grow. Research should now focus on
identifying administrative and behavioral methods that will prompt and
encourage voters to check their BMD-generated ballots before they drop them in
the ballot box.",2204.09780v1,cs.HC,2022-04-20 20:40:32+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Philip Kortum'), arxiv.Result.Author('Michael D. Byrne'), arxiv.Result.Author('Chidera O. Azubike'), arxiv.Result.Author('Laura E. Roty')]",
26,Nurse Staffing under Absenteeism: A Distributionally Robust Optimization Approach,"We study the nurse staffing problem under random nurse demand and
absenteeism. While the demand uncertainty is exogenous (stemming from the
random patient census), the absenteeism uncertainty is \emph{endogenous}, i.e.,
the number of nurses who show up for work partially depends on the nurse
staffing level. For quality of care, many hospitals have developed float pools,
i.e., groups of hospital units, and trained nurses to be able to work in
multiple units (termed cross-training) in response to potential nurse shortage.
In this paper, we propose a distributionally robust nurse staffing (DRNS) model
that considers both exogenous and endogenous uncertainties. We derive a
separation algorithm to solve this model under a general structure of float
pools. In addition, we identify several pool structures that often arise in
practice and recast the corresponding DRNS model as a mixed-integer linear
program, which facilitates off-the-shelf commercial solvers. Furthermore, we
optimize the float pool design to reduce cross-training while achieving
specified target staffing costs. The numerical case studies, based on the data
of a collaborating hospital, suggest that the units with high absenteeism
probability should be pooled together.",1909.09875v2,math.OC,2019-09-21 19:15:54+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Minseok Ryu'), arxiv.Result.Author('Ruiwei Jiang')]",

decoding is optimal, i.e., joint decoding of the bee barcodes does not result
in a better error exponent relative to independent decoding of each noisy
barcode. This is in contrast to the result without absentee bees, where joint
barcode decoding results in a significantly higher error exponent than
independent barcode decoding. We also define and characterize the ""capacity""

into subgroups (or districts), the adversary can construct a so-called ""Devil's
Menu"" consisting of several prices. In equilibrium, the adversary can buy the
real ballots of any strict subset of districts at a price corresponding to the
willingness to sell on the part of the citizens holding such ballots. By
contrast, decoy voters are trapped into selling their ballots at a low, or even
negligible, price. Blowing up the adversary's budget by introducing decoy
ballots may thus turn out to be futile. The Devil's Menu can also be applied to
the well-known ""Lemons Problem"".",1712.05477v1,cs.GT,2017-12-14 23:54:58+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Hans Gersbach'), arxiv.Result.Author('Akaki Mamageishvili'), arxiv.Result.Author('Oriol Tejada')]",
30,The ATHENA Class of Risk-Limiting Ballot Polling Audits,"The main risk-limiting ballot polling audit in use today, BRAVO, is designed
for use when single ballots are drawn at random and a decision regarding
whether to stop the audit or draw another ballot is taken after each ballot
draw (ballot-by-ballot (B2) audits). On the other hand, real ballot polling
audits draw many ballots in a single round before determining whether to stop
(round-by-round (R2) audits). We show that BRAVO results in significant
inefficiency when directly applied to real R2 audits. We present the ATHENA
class of R2 stopping rules, which we show are risk-limiting if the round
schedule is pre-determined (before the audit begins). We prove that each rule
is at least as efficient as the corresponding BRAVO stopping rule applied at
the end of the round. We have open-source software libraries implementing most
of our results.
  We show that ATHENA halves the number of ballots required, for all state
margins in the 2016 US Presidential election and a first round with $90\%$
stopping probability, when compared to BRAVO (stopping rule applied at the end
of the round). We present simulation results supporting the 90% stopping
probability claims and our claims for the risk accrued in the first round.
Further, ATHENA reduces the number of ballots by more than a quarter for low
margins, when compared to the BRAVO stopping rule applied on ballots in
selection order. This implies that keeping track of the order when drawing
ballots R2 is not beneficial, because ATHENA is more efficient even without
information on selection order. These results are significant because current
approaches to real ballot polling election audits use the B2 BRAVO rules,
requiring about twice as much work on the part of election officials. Applying
the rules in selection order requires fewer ballots, but keeping track of the
order, and entering it into audit software, adds to the effort.",2008.02315v5,cs.CR,2020-08-05 18:47:37+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Filip Zagórski'), arxiv.Result.Author('Grant McClearn'), arxiv.Result.Author('Sarah Morin'), arxiv.Result.Author('Neal McBurnett'), arxiv.Result.Author('Poorvi L.

31,Integration of a machine learning model into a decision support tool to predict absenteeism at work of prospective employees,"Purpose - Inefficient hiring may result in lower productivity and higher
training costs. Productivity losses caused by absenteeism at work cost U.S.
employers billions of dollars each year. Also, employers typically spend a
considerable amount of time managing employees who perform poorly. The purpose
of this study is to develop a decision support tool to predict absenteeism
among potential employees. Design/methodology/approach - We utilized a popular
open-access dataset. In order to categorize absenteeism classes, the data have
been preprocessed, and four methods of machine learning classification have
been applied: Multinomial Logistic Regression (MLR), Support Vector Machines
(SVM), Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), and Random Forests (RF). We selected
the best model, based on several validation scores, and compared its
performance against the existing model; we then integrated the best model into
our proposed web-based for hiring managers. Findings - A web-based decision
tool allows hiring managers to make more informed decisions before hiring a
potential employee, thus reducing time, financial loss and reducing the
probability of economic insolvency. Originality/value - In this paper, we
propose a model that is trained based on attributes that can be collected
during the hiring process. Furthermore, hiring managers may lack experience in
machine learning or do not have the time to spend developing machine learning
algorithms. Thus, we propose a web-based interactive tool that can be used

ballots from the top to the bottom of the stack, and then picking the ballot on
top. Unlike conventional methods of picking a ballot at random, $k$-cut does
not require identification numbers on the ballots or counting many ballots per

justifiably high confidence that the reported results of an election are
consistent with an audit trail (""ballots""), which can be paper or electronic.
SOBA combines three ideas: (1) publishing cast vote records (CVRs) separately
for each contest, so that anyone can verify that each reported contest outcome
is correct, if the CVRs reflect voters' intentions with sufficient accuracy;
(2) shrouding a mapping between ballots and the CVRs for those ballots to
prevent the loss of privacy that could occur otherwise; (3) assessing the
accuracy with which the CVRs reflect voters' intentions for a collection of
contests while simultaneously assessing the integrity of the shrouded mapping
between ballots and CVRs by comparing randomly selected ballots to the CVRs
that purport to represent them. Step (1) is related to work by the Humboldt
County Election Transparency Project, but publishing CVRs separately for
individual contests rather than images of entire ballots preserves privacy.
Step (2) requires a cryptographic commitment from elections officials.
Observers participate in step (3), which relies on the ""super-simple
simultaneous single-ballot risk-limiting audit."" Step (3) is designed to reveal
relatively few ballots if the shrouded mapping is proper and the CVRs
accurately reflect voter intent. But if the reported outcomes of the contests

Recent studies (e.g., Bernhard, et al. 2020) suggest the verification rate is

of voters being unable to do so accurately or whether this is because voters
simply choose not to attempt verification in the first place. In order to
understand this problem, we conducted an experiment in which 108 participants
participated in a mock election where the BMD displayed the voters' true
choices, but then changed a subset of those choices on the printed ballot. The
design of the printed ballot, the length of the ballot, the number of changes
that were made to the ballot, the location of those changes, and the
instructions provided to the voters were manipulated as part of the experiment.
Results indicated that of those voters who chose to examine the printed ballot,

41,Identifying Possible Winners in Ranked Choice Voting Elections with Outstanding Ballots,"Several election districts in the US have recently moved to ranked-choice
voting (RCV) to decide the results of local elections. RCV allows voters to
rank their choices, and the results are computed in rounds, eliminating one
candidate at a time. RCV ensures fairer elections and has been shown to
increase elected representation of women and people of color. A main drawback
of RCV is that the round-by-round process requires all the ballots to be
tallied before the results of an election can be calculated. With increasingly
large portions of ballots coming from absentee voters, RCV election outcomes
are not always apparent on election night, and can take several weeks to be
published, leading to a loss of trust in the electoral process from the public.
In this paper, we present an algorithm for efficiently computing possible
winners of RCV elections from partially known ballots and evaluate it on data
from the recent New York City Primary elections. We show that our techniques

traditional plurality voting in which voters submit rankings over the
candidates rather than single votes. In practice, elections using IRV often
restrict the ballot length, the number of candidates a voter is allowed to rank

influence the outcome of an election, given fixed voter preferences. We show
that there exist preference profiles over $k$ candidates such that up to $k-1$
different candidates win at different ballot lengths. We derive exact lower
bounds on the number of voters required for such profiles and provide a
construction matching the lower bound for unrestricted voter preferences.
Additionally, we characterize which sequences of winners are possible over
ballot lengths and provide explicit profile constructions achieving any
feasible winner sequence. We also examine how classic preference restrictions
influence our results--for instance, single-peakedness makes $k-1$ different
winners impossible but still allows at least $\Omega(\sqrt k)$. Finally, we
analyze a collection of 168 real-world elections, where we truncate rankings to
simulate shorter ballots. We find that shorter ballots could have changed the
outcome in one quarter of these elections. Our results highlight ballot length

45,Non(c)esuch Ballot-Level Risk-Limiting Audits for Precinct-Count Voting Systems,"Risk-limiting audits (RLAs) guarantee a high probability of correcting
incorrect reported outcomes before the outcomes are certified. The most
efficient use ballot-level comparison, comparing the voting system's
interpretation of individual ballot cards sampled at random (cast-vote records,
CVRs) from a trustworthy paper trail to a human interpretation of the same
cards. Such comparisons require the voting system to create and export CVRs in
a way that can be linked to the individual ballots the CVRs purport to
represent. Such links can be created by keeping the ballots in the order in
which they are scanned or by printing a unique serial number on each ballot.
But for precinct-count systems (PCOS), these strategies may compromise vote
anonymity: the order in which ballots are cast may identify the voters who cast
them. Printing a unique pseudo-random number (""cryptographic nonce"") on each
ballot card after the voter last touches it could reduce such privacy risks.
But what if the system does not in fact print a unique number on each ballot or
does not accurately report the numbers it printed? This paper gives two ways to
conduct an RLA so that even if the system does not print a genuine nonce on
each ballot or misreports the nonces it used, the audit's risk limit is not
compromised (however, the anonymity of votes might be compromised). One method
allows untrusted technology to be used to imprint and to retrieve ballot cards.
The method is adaptive: if the technology behaves properly, this protection
does not increase the audit workload. But if the imprinting or retrieval system
misbehaves, the sample size the RLA requires to confirm the reported results
when the results are correct is generally larger than if the imprinting and
retrieval were accurate.",2207.01362v1,cs.CR,2022-07-04 12:35:42+00:00,[arxiv.Result.Author('Philip B. Stark')],
46,"More style, less work: card-style data decrease risk-limiting audit sample sizes","U.S. elections rely heavily on computers such as voter registration
databases, electronic pollbooks, voting machines, scanners, tabulators, and
results reporting websites. These introduce digital threats to election
outcomes. Risk-limiting audits (RLAs) mitigate threats to some of these systems
by manually inspecting random samples of ballot cards. RLAs have a large chance
of correcting wrong outcomes (by conducting a full manual tabulation of a
trustworthy record of the votes), but can save labor when reported outcomes are
correct. This efficiency is eroded when sampling cannot be targeted to ballot
cards that contain the contest(s) under audit. If the sample is drawn from all
cast cards, RLA sample sizes scale like the reciprocal of the fraction of
ballot cards that contain the contest(s) under audit. That fraction shrinks as
the number of cards per ballot grows (i.e., when elections contain more
contests) and as the fraction of ballots that contain the contest decreases
(i.e., when a smaller percentage of voters are eligible to vote in the
contest). States that conduct RLAs of contests on multi-card ballots or of
small contests can dramatically reduce sample sizes by using information about
which ballot cards contain which contests -- by keeping track of card-style
data (CSD). For instance, CSD reduces the expected number of draws needed to

47,"Feature Engineering for US State Legislative Hearings: Stance, Affiliation, Engagement and Absentees","In US State government legislatures, most of the activity occurs in
committees made up of lawmakers discussing bills. When analyzing, classifying

broadly interesting. In this paper, we engineer four useful features, two
applying to lawmakers (engagement and absence), and two to non-lawmakers

representative supports or opposes the bill. The model tracking affiliation

48,How long is a piece of string? An exploration of multi-winner approval voting and ballot-length restrictions,"Multi-winner approval elections are seen in a variety of settings ranging
from academic societies and associations to public elections. In such
elections, it is often the case that ballot-length restrictions are enforced;
that is, where voters have a limit on the number of candidates which they can
vote for. Despite this common feature, there does not seem to be any
theoretical justification for ballot-length restrictions (Laslier and Van der
Straeten, 2016).
  This work endogenously derives the set of voter best-response ballot lengths
under complete information and with general assumptions on voter utilities and
voting rules. These results provide justification for some ballot-length
restrictions observed in practice, however when considering equilibrium
outcomes our analysis shows that this justification is no longer valid.
Equilibrium analysis is considered for voters with lazy and truth-bias
second-order tendencies and the equilibrium solution concept is pure-Nash
equilibria.
  The key insights show that ballot-length restrictions or institutional
features which make voting costly may lead to instability in election outcomes
when voters have diverse preferences, via the non-existence of equilibria. On
the other hand, when equilibria do exist they satisfy desirable properties
which are not guaranteed by equilibria attained under costless voting and in
the absence of ballot-length restrictions. In summary our results highlight a
stark trade-off between stable and desirable election outcomes.",1711.05092v1,cs.GT,2017-11-14 14:12:57+00:00,[arxiv.Result.Author('Barton E. Lee')],
49,Risk-Limiting Audits by Stratified Union-Intersection Tests of Elections (SUITE),"Risk-limiting audits (RLAs) offer a statistical guarantee: if a full manual
tally of the paper ballots would show that the reported election outcome is
wrong, an RLA has a known minimum chance of leading to a full manual tally.
RLAs generally rely on random samples. Stratified sampling--partitioning the
population of ballots into disjoint strata and sampling independently from the
strata--may simplify logistics or increase efficiency compared to simpler
sampling designs, but makes risk calculations harder. We present SUITE, a new
method for conducting RLAs using stratified samples. SUITE considers all
possible partitions of outcome-changing error across strata. For each
partition, it combines P-values from stratum-level tests into a combined
P-value; there is no restriction on the tests used in different strata. SUITE
maximizes the combined P-value over all partitions of outcome-changing error.
The audit can stop if that maximum is less than the risk limit. Voting systems
in some Colorado counties (comprising 98.2% of voters) allow auditors to check
how the system interpreted each ballot, which allows ballot-level comparison
RLAs. Other counties use ballot polling, which is less efficient. Extant
approaches to conducting an RLA of a statewide contest would require major
changes to Colorado's procedures and software, or would sacrifice the
efficiency of ballot-level comparison. SUITE does not. It divides ballots into
two strata: those cast in counties that can conduct ballot-level comparisons,
and the rest. Stratum-level P-values are found by methods derived here. The
resulting audit is substantially more efficient than statewide ballot polling.
SUITE is useful in any state with a mix of voting systems or that uses
stratified sampling for other reasons. We provide an open-source reference
implementation and exemplar calculations in Jupyter notebooks.",1809.04235v1,stat.AP,2018-09-12 02:56:22+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Kellie Ottoboni'), arxiv.Result.Author('Philip B. Stark'), arxiv.Result.Author('Mark Lindeman'), arxiv.Result.Author('Neal McBurnett')]",
50,Ballot stuffing and participation privacy in pollsite voting,"We study the problem of simultaneously addressing both ballot stuffing and
participation privacy for pollsite voting systems. Ballot stuffing is the
attack where fake ballots (not cast by any eligible voter) are inserted into
the system. Participation privacy is about hiding which eligible voters have
actually cast their vote. So far, the combination of ballot stuffing and
participation privacy has been mostly studied for internet voting, where voters
are assumed to own trusted computing devices. Such approaches are inapplicable
to pollsite voting where voters typically vote bare handed. We present an
eligibility audit protocol to detect ballot stuffing in pollsite voting
protocols. This is done while protecting participation privacy from a remote
observer - one who does not physically observe voters during voting. Our
protocol can be instantiated as an additional layer on top of most existing
pollsite E2E-V voting protocols. To achieve our guarantees, we develop an
efficient zero-knowledge proof (ZKP), that, given a value $v$ and a set $\Phi$
of commitments, proves $v$ is committed by some commitment in $\Phi$, without
revealing which one. We call this a ZKP of reverse set membership because of
its relationship to the popular ZKPs of set membership. This ZKP may be of
independent interest.",2210.14833v1,cs.CR,2022-10-26 16:29:23+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Prashant Agrawal'), arxiv.Result.Author('Abhinav Nakarmi'), arxiv.Result.Author('Mahabir Prasad Jhanwar'), arxiv.Result.Author('Subodh Sharma'), arxiv.Result.Author('Subhashis Banerjee')]",
51,Boardroom Voting: Verifiable Voting with Ballot Privacy Using Low-Tech Cryptography in a Single Room,"A boardroom election is an election that takes place in a single room -- the
boardroom -- in which all voters can see and hear each other. We present an
initial exploration of boardroom elections with ballot privacy and voter
verifiability that use only ""low-tech cryptography"" without using computers to
mark or collect ballots. Specifically, we define the problem, introduce several
building blocks, and propose a new protocol that combines these blocks in novel
ways. Our new building blocks include ""foldable ballots"" that can be rotated to
hide the alignment of ballot choices with voting marks, and ""visual secrets""
that are easy to remember and use but hard to describe. Although closely seated
participants in a boardroom election have limited privacy, the protocol ensures
that no one can determine how others voted. Moreover, each voter can verify
that their ballot was correctly cast, collected, and counted, without being
able to prove how they voted, providing assurance against undue influence.
Low-tech cryptography is useful in situations where constituents do not trust
computer technology, and it avoids the complex auditing requirements of
end-to-end cryptographic voting systems such as Pr\^{e}t-\`{a}-Voter. This
paper's building blocks and protocol are meant to be a proof of concept that
might be tested for usability and improved.",2007.14916v2,cs.CR,2020-07-29 15:40:51+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Enka Blanchard'), arxiv.Result.Author('Ted Selker'), arxiv.Result.Author('Alan T. Sherman')]",

show that covering a solid sphere by a set of complete spheres also results in
an asymptotically larger count of absentees, which is cubic in the radius of

to secure the voting process: namely, to certify that the computed results are
consistent with the cast ballots, and that the privacy of the voters is
preserved. We propose herein a secure voting protocol for elections that are
governed by order-based voting rules. Our protocol offers perfect ballot
secrecy, in the sense that it issues only the required output, while no other
information on the cast ballots is revealed. Such perfect secrecy, which is
achieved by employing secure multiparty computation tools, may increase the
voters' confidence and, consequently, encourage them to vote according to their
true preferences. Evaluation of the protocol's computational costs establishes
that it is lightweight and can be readily implemented in real-life electronic
elections.",2205.10580v3,cs.CR,2022-05-21 12:17:21+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Tamir Tassa'), arxiv.Result.Author('Lihi Dery')]",

generalize it to treat sequences of cells of common capacity s > 1, each of
them containing consecutive 2's (left) and 1's (right), and show that these
sequences can be changed into a ballot sequence via two manipulations, cyclic

while BAs are based on Bayesian inference. Until recently, the two have been
thought of as fundamentally different.
  We present results that unify and shed light upon 'ballot-polling' RLAs and
BAs (which only require the ability to sample uniformly at random from all cast
ballot cards) for two-candidate plurality contests, which are building blocks
for auditing more complex social choice functions, including some preferential
voting systems. We highlight the connections between the methods and explore
their performance.
  First, building on a previous demonstration of the mathematical equivalence
of classical and Bayesian approaches, we show that BAs, suitably calibrated,
are risk-limiting. Second, we compare the efficiency of the methods across a
wide range of contest sizes and margins, focusing on the distribution of sample
sizes required to attain a given risk limit. Third, we outline several ways to
improve performance and show how the mathematical equivalence explains the

58,Limiting Risk by Turning Manifest Phantoms into Evil Zombies,"Drawing a random sample of ballots to conduct a risk-limiting audit generally
requires knowing how the ballots cast in an election are organized into groups,
for instance, how many containers of ballots there are in all and how many

with number of ballots in each group is called a ballot manifest. What if the
ballot manifest is not accurate? Surprisingly, even if ballots are known to be
missing from the manifest, it is not necessary to make worst-case assumptions
about those ballots--for instance, to adjust the margin by the number of
missing ballots--to ensure that the audit remains conservative. Rather, it
suffices to make worst-case assumptions about the individual randomly selected
ballots that the audit cannot find. This observation provides a simple
modification to some risk-limiting audit procedures that makes them
automatically become more conservative if the ballot manifest has errors. The
modification--phantoms to evil zombies (~2EZ)--requires only an upper bound on

larger than it would be had the manifest been accurate, automatically requiring
more than enough ballots to be audited to offset the manifest errors. This
ensures that the true risk limit remains smaller than the nominal risk limit.

61,Identifying Possible Winners in Ranked Choice Voting Elections with Outstanding Ballots,"Several election districts in the US have recently moved to ranked-choice
voting (RCV) to decide the results of local elections. RCV allows voters to
rank their choices, and the results are computed in rounds, eliminating one
candidate at a time. RCV ensures fairer elections and has been shown to
increase elected representation of women and people of color. A main drawback
of RCV is that the round-by-round process requires all the ballots to be
tallied before the results of an election can be calculated. With increasingly
large portions of ballots coming from absentee voters, RCV election outcomes
are not always apparent on election night, and can take several weeks to be
published, leading to a loss of trust in the electoral process from the public.
In this paper, we present an algorithm for efficiently computing possible
winners of RCV elections from partially known ballots and evaluate it on data
from the recent New York City Primary elections. We show that our techniques

perform with near-perfect accuracy regardless of ballot length, ballot type,
number of altered races, and location of altered races. Detection performance
was extremely robust. We conclude that with proper direction and resources,
voters can be near-perfect detectors of ballot changes on printed paper ballots

the number of nurses who show up for work partially depends on the nurse
staffing level. For quality of care, many hospitals have developed float pools,
i.e., groups of hospital units, and trained nurses to be able to work in
multiple units (termed cross-training) in response to potential nurse shortage.
In this paper, we propose a distributionally robust nurse staffing (DRNS) model
that considers both exogenous and endogenous uncertainties. We derive a
separation algorithm to solve this model under a general structure of float
pools. In addition, we identify several pool structures that often arise in
practice and recast the corresponding DRNS model as a mixed-integer linear
program, which facilitates off-the-shelf commercial solvers. Furthermore, we
optimize the float pool design to reduce cross-training while achieving

real ballots of any strict subset of districts at a price corresponding to the
willingness to sell on the part of the citizens holding such ballots. By
contrast, decoy voters are trapped into selling their ballots at a low, or even
negligible, price. Blowing up the adversary's budget by introducing decoy

70,The ATHENA Class of Risk-Limiting Ballot Polling Audits,"The main risk-limiting ballot polling audit in use today, BRAVO, is designed
for use when single ballots are drawn at random and a decision regarding
whether to stop the audit or draw another ballot is taken after each ballot
draw (ballot-by-ballot (B2) audits). On the other hand, real ballot polling
audits draw many ballots in a single round before determining whether to stop
(round-by-round (R2) audits). We show that BRAVO results in significant
inefficiency when directly applied to real R2 audits. We present the ATHENA
class of R2 stopping rules, which we show are risk-limiting if the round
schedule is pre-determined (before the audit begins). We prove that each rule
is at least as efficient as the corresponding BRAVO stopping rule applied at
the end of the round. We have open-source software libraries implementing most
of our results.

stopping probability, when compared to BRAVO (stopping rule applied at the end
of the round). We present simulation results supporting the 90% stopping
probability claims and our claims for the risk accrued in the first round.
Further, ATHENA reduces the number of ballots by more than a quarter for low
margins, when compared to the BRAVO stopping rule applied on ballots in
selection order. This implies that keeping track of the order when drawing
ballots R2 is not beneficial, because ATHENA is more efficient even without
information on selection order. These results are significant because current
approaches to real ballot polling election audits use the B2 BRAVO rules,
requiring about twice as much work on the part of election officials. Applying
the rules in selection order requires fewer ballots, but keeping track of the

71,Integration of a machine learning model into a decision support tool to predict absenteeism at work of prospective employees,"Purpose - Inefficient hiring may result in lower productivity and higher
training costs. Productivity losses caused by absenteeism at work cost U.S.
employers billions of dollars each year. Also, employers typically spend a
considerable amount of time managing employees who perform poorly. The purpose
of this study is to develop a decision support tool to predict absenteeism
among potential employees. Design/methodology/approach - We utilized a popular
open-access dataset. In order to categorize absenteeism classes, the data have
been preprocessed, and four methods of machine learning classification have
been applied: Multinomial Logistic Regression (MLR), Support Vector Machines
(SVM), Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), and Random Forests (RF). We selected
the best model, based on several validation scores, and compared its
performance against the existing model; we then integrated the best model into
our proposed web-based for hiring managers. Findings - A web-based decision
tool allows hiring managers to make more informed decisions before hiring a
potential employee, thus reducing time, financial loss and reducing the
probability of economic insolvency. Originality/value - In this paper, we
propose a model that is trained based on attributes that can be collected
during the hiring process. Furthermore, hiring managers may lack experience in
machine learning or do not have the time to spend developing machine learning
algorithms. Thus, we propose a web-based interactive tool that can be used
without prior knowledge of machine learning algorithms.",2202.03577v1,cs.LG,2022-02-02 03:49:01+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Gopal Nath'), arxiv.Result.Author('Antoine Harfouche'), arxiv.Result.Author('Austin Coursey'), arxiv.Result.Author('Krishna K.

72,$k$-Cut: A Simple Approximately-Uniform Method for Sampling Ballots in Post-Election Audits,"We present an approximate sampling framework and discuss how risk-limiting

""risk-limiting"" properties. Our framework is general and can compensate for
counting mistakes made during audits.
  Moreover, we present and analyze a simple approximate sampling
method,""$k$-cut"", for picking a ballot randomly from a stack, without counting.
Our method involves doing $k$ ""cuts"", each involving moving a random portion of
ballots from the top to the bottom of the stack, and then picking the ballot on
top. Unlike conventional methods of picking a ballot at random, $k$-cut does
not require identification numbers on the ballots or counting many ballots per
draw. We analyze how close the distribution of chosen ballots is to the uniform
distribution, and design different mitigation procedures. We show that $k=6$

justifiably high confidence that the reported results of an election are
consistent with an audit trail (""ballots""), which can be paper or electronic.
SOBA combines three ideas: (1) publishing cast vote records (CVRs) separately
for each contest, so that anyone can verify that each reported contest outcome
is correct, if the CVRs reflect voters' intentions with sufficient accuracy;
(2) shrouding a mapping between ballots and the CVRs for those ballots to
prevent the loss of privacy that could occur otherwise; (3) assessing the
accuracy with which the CVRs reflect voters' intentions for a collection of
contests while simultaneously assessing the integrity of the shrouded mapping
between ballots and CVRs by comparing randomly selected ballots to the CVRs
that purport to represent them. Step (1) is related to work by the Humboldt
County Election Transparency Project, but publishing CVRs separately for
individual contests rather than images of entire ballots preserves privacy.
Step (2) requires a cryptographic commitment from elections officials.
Observers participate in step (3), which relies on the ""super-simple
simultaneous single-ballot risk-limiting audit."" Step (3) is designed to reveal
relatively few ballots if the shrouded mapping is proper and the CVRs
accurately reflect voter intent. But if the reported outcomes of the contests
differ from the outcomes that a full hand count would show, step (3) is

ballot marking devices (BMDs) is presently the subject of some controversy.
Recent studies (e.g., Bernhard, et al. 2020) suggest the verification rate is
low. What is not clear from previous research is whether this is more a result
of voters being unable to do so accurately or whether this is because voters
simply choose not to attempt verification in the first place. In order to
understand this problem, we conducted an experiment in which 108 participants
participated in a mock election where the BMD displayed the voters' true
choices, but then changed a subset of those choices on the printed ballot. The
design of the printed ballot, the length of the ballot, the number of changes
that were made to the ballot, the location of those changes, and the
instructions provided to the voters were manipulated as part of the experiment.
Results indicated that of those voters who chose to examine the printed ballot,
76% detected anomalies, indicating that voters can reliably detect errors on
their ballot if they will simply review it. This suggests that administrative

evidence against or in support of the recorded result. Risk-limiting audits for

show that covering a solid sphere by a set of complete spheres also results in
an asymptotically larger count of absentees, which is cubic in the radius of

Chaum's work on code voting assumed voting codes are physically delivered to
voters using the mail system, implicitly requiring to trust the mail system.
This is not necessarily a valid assumption to make - especially if the mail
system cannot be trusted. When conspiring with the recipient of the cast
ballots, privacy is broken.
  It is clear to the public that when it comes to privacy, computers and
""secure"" communication over the Internet cannot fully be trusted. This
emphasizes the importance of using: (1) Unconditional security for secure
network communication. (2) Reduce reliance on untrusted computers.
  In this paper we explore how to remove the mail system trust assumption in
code voting. We use PSMT protocols (SCN 2012) where with the help of visual
aids, humans can carry out $\mod 10$ addition correctly with a 99\% degree of

voting (RCV) to decide the results of local elections. RCV allows voters to
rank their choices, and the results are computed in rounds, eliminating one
candidate at a time. RCV ensures fairer elections and has been shown to
increase elected representation of women and people of color. A main drawback
of RCV is that the round-by-round process requires all the ballots to be
tallied before the results of an election can be calculated. With increasingly
large portions of ballots coming from absentee voters, RCV election outcomes
are not always apparent on election night, and can take several weeks to be
published, leading to a loss of trust in the electoral process from the public.
In this paper, we present an algorithm for efficiently computing possible
winners of RCV elections from partially known ballots and evaluate it on data
from the recent New York City Primary elections. We show that our techniques
allow to significantly narrow down the field of possible election winners, and

at the edge server (ES) are obtained with non-coherent detectors by exploiting
the accumulations on the resources. Hence, the proposed scheme eliminates the
need for channel state information (CSI) at the EDs and ES. In this study, we
analyze various gradient-encoding strategies through the weight functions and
waveform configurations over orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM).
We show that specific weight functions that enable absentee EDs (i.e.,
hard-coded participation with absentees (HPA)) or weighted votes (i.e.,
soft-coded participation (SP)) can substantially reduce the probability of
detecting the incorrect MV. By taking path loss, power control, cell size, and
fading channel into account, we prove the convergence of the distributed
learning for a non-convex function for HPA. Through simulations, we show that
the proposed scheme with HPA and SP can provide high test accuracy even when

94,The Computational Impact of Partial Votes on Strategic Voting,"In many real world elections, agents are not required to rank all candidates.
We study three of the most common methods used to modify voting rules to deal
with such partial votes. These methods modify scoring rules (like the Borda
count), elimination style rules (like single transferable vote) and rules based
on the tournament graph (like Copeland) respectively. We argue that with an
elimination style voting rule like single transferable vote, partial voting
does not change the situations where strategic voting is possible. However,
with scoring rules and rules based on the tournament graph, partial voting can
increase the situations where strategic voting is possible. As a consequence,
the computational complexity of computing a strategic vote can change. For
example, with Borda count, the complexity of computing a strategic vote can
decrease or stay the same depending on how we score partial votes.",1405.7714v1,cs.GT,2014-05-28 12:13:52+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Nina Narodytska'), arxiv.Result.Author('Toby Walsh')]",
95,Verification of the Socio-Technical Aspects of Voting: The Case of the Polish Postal Vote 2020,"Voting procedures are designed and implemented by people, for people, and
with significant human involvement. Thus, one should take into account the
human factors in order to comprehensively analyze properties of an election and
detect threats. In particular, it is essential to assess how actions and
strategies of the involved agents (voters, municipal office employees, mail
clerks) can influence the outcome of other agents' actions as well as the
overall outcome of the election. In this paper, we present our first attempt to
capture those aspects in a formal multi-agent model of the Polish presidential
election 2020. The election marked the first time when postal vote was
universally available in Poland. Unfortunately, the voting scheme was prepared
under time pressure and political pressure, and without the involvement of
experts. This might have opened up possibilities for various kinds of ballot
fraud, in-house coercion, etc. We propose a preliminary scalable model of the
procedure in the form of a Multi-Agent Graph, and formalize selected integrity
and security properties by formulas of agent logics. Then, we transform the
models and formulas so that they can be input to the state-of-art model checker
Uppaal. The first series of experiments demonstrates that verification scales
rather badly due to the state-space explosion. However, we show that a recently
developed technique of user-friendly model reduction by variable abstraction

most part, secure, accurate and understandable by the average voter. This
thesis explores the design of electronic voting systems designed to achieve

  Electronic voting systems have seen limited use within Australian elections,
most prominently for State Elections in Victoria (2014), New South Wales (2015)
and Western Australia (2017), along with trials of electronic voting systems in
federal elections in 2007.
  This thesis presents an analysis of the iVote electronic voting system used
for the 2017 Western Australian State Election (iVote WA), outlining a number
of security risks introduced by the use of cloud-based distributed denial of
service mitigation. In addition, this thesis presents the results of a
cross-sectional survey of Australian voters regarding levels of trust for three
voting systems: the existing paper-based system used for Australian federal
elections, the iVote WA system, and the vVote system used for the 2014
Victorian State Election.

cares about the voters' wishes, demands a recount in a subset of the
manipulated districts, restoring their vote counts to their original values. We

hurdle that the two key components, inflation expectations and the output gap,
are both unobserved. Traditional remedies include creating reasonable proxies
for the notable absentees or extracting them via some form of assumptions-heavy
filtering procedure. I propose an alternative route: a Hemisphere Neural
Network (HNN) whose peculiar architecture yields a final layer where components
can be interpreted as latent states within a Neural Phillips Curve. There are
benefits. First, HNN conducts the supervised estimation of nonlinearities that
arise when translating a high-dimensional set of observed regressors into
latent states. Second, computations are fast. Third, forecasts are economically
interpretable. Fourth, inflation volatility can also be predicted by merely
adding a hemisphere to the model. Among other findings, the contribution of
real activity to inflation appears severely underestimated in traditional
econometric specifications. Also, HNN captures out-of-sample the 2021 upswing
in inflation and attributes it first to an abrupt and sizable disanchoring of
the expectations component, followed by a wildly positive gap starting from
late 2020. HNN's gap unique path comes from dispensing with unemployment and
GDP in favor of an amalgam of nonlinearly processed alternative tightness

incompleteness calls for a proper characterization of the absentee-voxels whose
restoration will yield a complete spherical surface without any holes. In this
paper, we present a characterization of such absentee-voxels using certain
techniques of digital geometry and show that their count varies quadratically
with the radius of the semicircular generatrix. Next, we design an algorithm to
fill these absentee-voxels so as to generate a spherical surface of revolution,
which is more realistic from the viewpoint of visual perception. We further
show that covering a solid sphere by a set of complete spheres also results in
an asymptotically larger count of absentees, which is cubic in the radius of
the sphere. The characterization and generation of complete solid spheres
without any holes can also be accomplished in a similar fashion. We furnish

102,Nurse Staffing under Absenteeism: A Distributionally Robust Optimization Approach,"We study the nurse staffing problem under random nurse demand and
absenteeism. While the demand uncertainty is exogenous (stemming from the
random patient census), the absenteeism uncertainty is \emph{endogenous}, i.e.,
the number of nurses who show up for work partially depends on the nurse
staffing level. For quality of care, many hospitals have developed float pools,
i.e., groups of hospital units, and trained nurses to be able to work in
multiple units (termed cross-training) in response to potential nurse shortage.
In this paper, we propose a distributionally robust nurse staffing (DRNS) model
that considers both exogenous and endogenous uncertainties. We derive a
separation algorithm to solve this model under a general structure of float
pools. In addition, we identify several pool structures that often arise in
practice and recast the corresponding DRNS model as a mixed-integer linear
program, which facilitates off-the-shelf commercial solvers. Furthermore, we
optimize the float pool design to reduce cross-training while achieving
specified target staffing costs. The numerical case studies, based on the data
of a collaborating hospital, suggest that the units with high absenteeism
probability should be pooled together.",1909.09875v2,math.OC,2019-09-21 19:15:54+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Minseok Ryu'), arxiv.Result.Author('Ruiwei Jiang')]",

barcode. This is in contrast to the result without absentee bees, where joint
barcode decoding results in a significantly higher error exponent than
independent barcode decoding. We also define and characterize the ""capacity""

104,Integration of a machine learning model into a decision support tool to predict absenteeism at work of prospective employees,"Purpose - Inefficient hiring may result in lower productivity and higher
training costs. Productivity losses caused by absenteeism at work cost U.S.
employers billions of dollars each year. Also, employers typically spend a
considerable amount of time managing employees who perform poorly. The purpose
of this study is to develop a decision support tool to predict absenteeism
among potential employees. Design/methodology/approach - We utilized a popular
open-access dataset. In order to categorize absenteeism classes, the data have
been preprocessed, and four methods of machine learning classification have
been applied: Multinomial Logistic Regression (MLR), Support Vector Machines
(SVM), Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), and Random Forests (RF). We selected
the best model, based on several validation scores, and compared its
performance against the existing model; we then integrated the best model into
our proposed web-based for hiring managers. Findings - A web-based decision
tool allows hiring managers to make more informed decisions before hiring a
potential employee, thus reducing time, financial loss and reducing the
probability of economic insolvency. Originality/value - In this paper, we
propose a model that is trained based on attributes that can be collected
during the hiring process. Furthermore, hiring managers may lack experience in
machine learning or do not have the time to spend developing machine learning
algorithms. Thus, we propose a web-based interactive tool that can be used

107,Identifying Possible Winners in Ranked Choice Voting Elections with Outstanding Ballots,"Several election districts in the US have recently moved to ranked-choice
voting (RCV) to decide the results of local elections. RCV allows voters to
rank their choices, and the results are computed in rounds, eliminating one
candidate at a time. RCV ensures fairer elections and has been shown to
increase elected representation of women and people of color. A main drawback
of RCV is that the round-by-round process requires all the ballots to be
tallied before the results of an election can be calculated. With increasingly
large portions of ballots coming from absentee voters, RCV election outcomes
are not always apparent on election night, and can take several weeks to be
published, leading to a loss of trust in the electoral process from the public.
In this paper, we present an algorithm for efficiently computing possible
winners of RCV elections from partially known ballots and evaluate it on data
from the recent New York City Primary elections. We show that our techniques
allow to significantly narrow down the field of possible election winners, and
in some case identify the winner as soon as election night despite a number of

calculate the majority vote (MV) for federated edge learning (FEEL). With the
proposed approach, edge devices (EDs) transmit the signs of local stochastic
gradients, i.e., votes, by activating one of two orthogonal resources. The MVs
at the edge server (ES) are obtained with non-coherent detectors by exploiting
the accumulations on the resources. Hence, the proposed scheme eliminates the
need for channel state information (CSI) at the EDs and ES. In this study, we
analyze various gradient-encoding strategies through the weight functions and
waveform configurations over orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM).
We show that specific weight functions that enable absentee EDs (i.e.,
hard-coded participation with absentees (HPA)) or weighted votes (i.e.,
soft-coded participation (SP)) can substantially reduce the probability of
detecting the incorrect MV. By taking path loss, power control, cell size, and
fading channel into account, we prove the convergence of the distributed
learning for a non-convex function for HPA. Through simulations, we show that
the proposed scheme with HPA and SP can provide high test accuracy even when
the time-synchronization and the power control are not ideal under
heterogeneous data distribution scenarios.",2209.04692v2,cs.IT,2022-09-10 15:25:45+00:00,[arxiv.Result.Author('Alphan Sahin')],

semicircle (generatrix) around its diameter, consists of some holes

incompleteness calls for a proper characterization of the absentee-voxels whose
restoration will yield a complete spherical surface without any holes. In this
paper, we present a characterization of such absentee-voxels using certain
techniques of digital geometry and show that their count varies quadratically
with the radius of the semicircular generatrix. Next, we design an algorithm to
fill these absentee-voxels so as to generate a spherical surface of revolution,
which is more realistic from the viewpoint of visual perception. We further
show that covering a solid sphere by a set of complete spheres also results in
an asymptotically larger count of absentees, which is cubic in the radius of
the sphere. The characterization and generation of complete solid spheres
without any holes can also be accomplished in a similar fashion. We furnish

122,Variance partitioning in multilevel models for count data,"A first step when fitting multilevel models to continuous responses is to
explore the degree of clustering in the data. Researchers fit
variance-component models and then report the proportion of variation in the
response that is due to systematic differences between clusters. Equally they
report the response correlation between units within a cluster. These
statistics are popularly referred to as variance partition coefficients (VPCs)
and intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs). When fitting multilevel models
to categorical (binary, ordinal, or nominal) and count responses, these
statistics prove more challenging to calculate. For categorical response
models, researchers appeal to their latent response formulations and report
VPCs/ICCs in terms of latent continuous responses envisaged to underly the
observed categorical responses. For standard count response models, however,
there are no corresponding latent response formulations. More generally, there
is a paucity of guidance on how to partition the variation. As a result,
applied researchers are likely to avoid or inadequately report and discuss the
substantive importance of clustering and cluster effects in their studies. A
recent article drew attention to a little-known exact algebraic expression for
the VPC/ICC for the special case of the two-level random-intercept Poisson
model. In this article, we make a substantial new contribution. First, we
derive exact VPC/ICC expressions for more flexible negative binomial models
that allows for overdispersion, a phenomenon which often occurs in practice.
Then we derive exact VPC/ICC expressions for three-level and random-coefficient
extensions to these models. We illustrate our work with an application to

123,Nurse Staffing under Absenteeism: A Distributionally Robust Optimization Approach,"We study the nurse staffing problem under random nurse demand and
absenteeism. While the demand uncertainty is exogenous (stemming from the
random patient census), the absenteeism uncertainty is \emph{endogenous}, i.e.,
the number of nurses who show up for work partially depends on the nurse
staffing level. For quality of care, many hospitals have developed float pools,
i.e., groups of hospital units, and trained nurses to be able to work in
multiple units (termed cross-training) in response to potential nurse shortage.
In this paper, we propose a distributionally robust nurse staffing (DRNS) model
that considers both exogenous and endogenous uncertainties. We derive a
separation algorithm to solve this model under a general structure of float
pools. In addition, we identify several pool structures that often arise in
practice and recast the corresponding DRNS model as a mixed-integer linear
program, which facilitates off-the-shelf commercial solvers. Furthermore, we
optimize the float pool design to reduce cross-training while achieving
specified target staffing costs. The numerical case studies, based on the data
of a collaborating hospital, suggest that the units with high absenteeism
probability should be pooled together.",1909.09875v2,math.OC,2019-09-21 19:15:54+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Minseok Ryu'), arxiv.Result.Author('Ruiwei Jiang')]",

of the bee-identification error exponent, and show that independent barcode
decoding is optimal, i.e., joint decoding of the bee barcodes does not result
in a better error exponent relative to independent decoding of each noisy
barcode. This is in contrast to the result without absentee bees, where joint
barcode decoding results in a significantly higher error exponent than
independent barcode decoding. We also define and characterize the ""capacity""

125,Forecasting the 2013--2014 Influenza Season using Wikipedia,"Infectious diseases are one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality
around the world; thus, forecasting their impact is crucial for planning an
effective response strategy. According to the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention (CDC), seasonal influenza affects between 5% to 20% of the U.S.
population and causes major economic impacts resulting from hospitalization and
absenteeism. Understanding influenza dynamics and forecasting its impact is
fundamental for developing prevention and mitigation strategies.
  We combine modern data assimilation methods with Wikipedia access logs and
CDC influenza like illness (ILI) reports to create a weekly forecast for
seasonal influenza. The methods are applied to the 2013--2014 influenza season
but are sufficiently general to forecast any disease outbreak, given incidence
or case count data. We adjust the initialization and parametrization of a
disease model and show that this allows us to determine systematic model bias.
In addition, we provide a way to determine where the model diverges from
observation and evaluate forecast accuracy.
  Wikipedia article access logs are shown to be highly correlated with
historical ILI records and allow for accurate prediction of ILI data several
weeks before it becomes available. The results show that prior to the peak of
the flu season, our forecasting method projected the actual outcome with a high
probability. However, since our model does not account for re-infection or
multiple strains of influenza, the tail of the epidemic is not predicted well

Pineapple equipment are used for passively capturing ambient probe requests

an output. Such an information-based approach is in sharp contrast to the
conventional mathematical modelling of information-driven systems whereby one
attempts to come up with essentially {\it ad hoc} models for the outputs. Here,
dynamics of electoral competition is modelled by the specification of the flow
of information relevant to election. The seemingly random evolution of the
election poll statistics are then derived as model outputs, which in turn are
used to study election prediction, impact of disinformation, and the optimal
strategy for information management in an election campaign.",1904.12614v2,physics.soc-ph,2019-04-21 10:46:51+00:00,[arxiv.Result.Author('Dorje C Brody')],"Information Geometry, 2019"
146,SEER: Performance-Aware Leader Election in Single-Leader Consensus,"Modern stateful web services and distributed SDN controllers rely on log
replication to omit data loss in case of fail-stop failures. In single-leader
execution, the leader replica is responsible for ordering log updates and the
initiation of distributed commits, in order to guarantee log consistency.
Network congestions, resource-heavy computation, and imbalanced resource
allocations may, however, result in inappropriate leader election and increased
cluster response times.
  We present SEER, a logically centralized approach to performance prediction
and efficient leader election in leader-based consensus systems. SEER
autonomously identifies the replica that minimizes the average cluster response
time, using prediction models trained dynamically at runtime. To balance the
exploration and exploitation, SEER explores replicas' performance and updates
their prediction models only after detecting significant system changes. We
evaluate SEER in a traffic management scenario comprising [3..7] Raft replicas,
and well-known data-center and WAN topologies. Compared to the Raft's uniform
leader election, SEER decreases the mean control plane response time by up to
~32%. The benefit comes at the expense of the minimal adaptation of Raft
election procedure and a slight increase in leader reconfiguration frequency,
the latter being tunable with a guaranteed upper bound. No safety properties of
Raft are invalidated by SEER.",2104.01355v1,cs.NI,2021-04-03 09:15:16+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Ermin Sakic'), arxiv.Result.Author('Petra Vizarreta'), arxiv.Result.Author('Wolfgang Kellerer')]",

show that covering a solid sphere by a set of complete spheres also results in
an asymptotically larger count of absentees, which is cubic in the radius of

measures are likely to be most effective and whether existing interventions
could contain the spread of an outbreak on campus. We develop a full-scale
stochastic agent-based model to determine whether in-person instruction could
safely continue during the pandemic and evaluate the necessity of various
interventions. Simulation results indicate that large scale randomized testing,
contact-tracing, and quarantining are important components of a successful
strategy for containing campus outbreaks. High test specificity is critical for
keeping the size of the quarantine population manageable. Moving the largest
classes online is also crucial for controlling both the size of outbreaks and
the number of students in quarantine. Increased residential exposure can
significantly impact the size of an outbreak, but it is likely more important
to control non-residential social exposure among students. Finally, necessarily
high quarantine rates even in controlled outbreaks imply significant

scheduling nursing staff and reduce high absenteeism rate observed among the
part-time nurses. We developed a spreadsheet-based scheduling tool to automate
the generation of schedules and incorporate nurses' preferences for different
shifts into the schedules. At the core of the scheduling tool is a hierarchical
optimization model that generates a feasible schedule with the highest total
preference score while satisfying the maximum possible demand. Feasible
schedules had to abide by a set of complex seniority requirements which
prioritized more senior nurses when allocating the available shifts. Our
scheduling tool was implemented in a 391-bed home in Toronto. The tool allowed
nursing managers to generate feasible schedules within a fraction of an hour,
in contrast to the status-quo manual approach which could took up to tens of
hours. In addition, the schedules successfully accounted for preferences with
on average above 94% of the allocated shifts ranked as most preferred.",2102.09461v1,cs.CY,2021-02-17 00:10:35+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Manion Anderson'), arxiv.Result.Author('Merve Bodur'), arxiv.Result.Author('Scott Rathwell'), arxiv.Result.Author('Vahid Sarhangian')]",

transaction-level campaign contributions to federal and local candidates. In
stacked Difference-in-Differences models, we find that unionization results in
a leftward shift of campaign contributions. Unionization increases the support

157,SOS: Socially Omitting Selfishness in IoT for Smart and Connected Communities,"Smart and Connected Communities (SCC) is an emerging field of Internet of
Things (IoT), and it is having potential applications to improve human life.
The improvement may be in terms of preservation, revitalization, livability,
and sustainability of a community. The resources of the nodes and devices in
the SCC have certain constraints that may not allow the devices and nodes to
cooperate to save their resources such as memory, energy, and buffer, or simply
maximize their performance. Thus, to stimulate the nodes to avoid selfish
behavior, SSC needs a novel and well-organized solution to motivate nodes for
cooperation. This article aims to resolve the issue of selfish behaviors in SCC
and to encourage the nodes for cooperation. A novel mechanism Socially Omitting
Selfishness (SOS) has been proposed to manage/eradicate selfishness using a
socially-oriented election process. The election process elects different heads
based on weight and cooperation (using VCG model). The election of heads and
incentive mechanism encourages the nodes to show participation and behave as
highly cooperative members of the community. Furthermore, an extended version
of the Dempster-Shafer model has been used to discourage the selfish behavior
of the participating nodes in the SOS scheme. It uses different monitoring and
gateway nodes to efficiently employ the proposed scheme. A mathematical model
has been developed for the aforementioned aspects and simulated through the NS2
simulation environment to analyze the performance of SOS. The results of the
proposed scheme outperform the contemporary schemes in terms of average

160,Identifying Possible Winners in Ranked Choice Voting Elections with Outstanding Ballots,"Several election districts in the US have recently moved to ranked-choice

increase elected representation of women and people of color. A main drawback
of RCV is that the round-by-round process requires all the ballots to be
tallied before the results of an election can be calculated. With increasingly
large portions of ballots coming from absentee voters, RCV election outcomes
are not always apparent on election night, and can take several weeks to be

163,Electoral Stability and Rigidity,"Some argue that political stability is best served through a two-party
system. This study refutes this. The author mathematically defines the
stability and rigidity of electoral systems comprised of any quantity of
electors and parties. In fact, stability is a function of the quantity of
electors - i.e., the number of occupied seats at the table. As the number of
electors increases, the properties of an electorate are increasingly well
resolved, and well described by those of an electorate that is least excessive
-- that is to say an electorate that is closest to equilibrium. Further,
electoral rigidity is a function of the quantity of parties and their
probabilities of representation. An absolutely rigid system admits no
fluctuations -- whatever happens to one elector will happen to all electors. As
the quantity of parties increases so does the number of party lines, and with
it the quantity of alternatives with which to respond to an external stimulus.
Rigidity is significant in a social system that places high value on party
loyalty. In conclusion, (i) electoral stability is best served by increasing
the quantity of electors; (ii) electoral rigidity is best served by decreasing
the quantity of parties, and by increasing the representation of some parties
at the expense of others; and (iii) the less stable a branch of government, the
more concern is placed on those who would hold those offices for the people.",1608.05038v1,q-fin.EC,2016-08-16 05:17:34+00:00,[arxiv.Result.Author('Michael Y. Levy')],

second model is an extension of the first one in which we include a $rule$

consequence, at some specific time step. In the third model we neglect the
interactions with the electors while we consider cubic and quartic interactions

169,Electoral Susceptibility,"In the United States electoral system, a candidate is elected indirectly by
winning a majority of electoral votes cast by individual states, the election
usually being decided by the votes cast by a small number of ""swing states""
where the two candidates historically have roughly equal probabilities of
winning. The effective value of a swing state in deciding the election is
determined not only by the number of its electoral votes but by the frequency
of its appearance in the set of winning partitions of the electoral college.
Since the electoral vote values of swing states are not identical, the presence
or absence of a state in a winning partition is generally correlated with the
frequency of appearance of other states and, hence, their effective values. We
quantify the effective value of states by an {\sl electoral susceptibility},
$\chi_j$, the variation of the winning probability with the ""cost"" of changing
the probability of winning state $j$. We study $\chi_j$ for realistic data
accumulated for the 2012 U.S. presidential election and for a simple model with
a Zipf's law type distribution of electoral votes. In the latter model we show
that the susceptibility for small states is largest in ""one-sided"" electoral
contests and smallest in close contests. We draw an analogy to models of
entropically driven interactions in poly-disperse colloidal solutions.",1211.0656v1,physics.soc-ph,2012-11-04 00:54:59+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('G. C. Levine'), arxiv.Result.Author('B. Caravan'), arxiv.Result.Author('J. E. Cerise')]",

polynomial time if the electorate is single-peaked (i.e., is polarized along
some axis/issue). However, real-world electorates are not truly single-peaked.
There are usually some mavericks, and so real-world electorates tend to merely
be nearly single-peaked. This paper studies the complexity of
manipulative-action algorithms for elections over nearly single-peaked
electorates, for various notions of nearness and various election systems. We
provide instances where even one maverick jumps the manipulative-action

results are not explained by (potential) changes in judge, voter, or candidate
behavior over the electoral process. I additionally perform machine
classification of court documents to estimate heterogeneous punishment for
severe and trivial crimes. I document a larger electoral penalty (6.5 p.p.) if
candidates are convicted for severe crimes. These results supplement the

influences voters' decisions and showing that voters react more strongly to

been used to make predictions (poll) about several electoral events. Given $q$
candidates for an election and a time-series of Twitts (short messages), one
can extract the $q$ mean trends and the $q(q+1)/2$ Twitt-to-Twitt correlations,
and look for the statistical models that reproduce these data. On the base of
several electoral events and assuming a stationary regime, we find out the
following: i) the maximization of the entropy singles out a microscopic model
(single-Twitt-level) that coincides with a $q$-state Potts model having
suitable couplings and external fields to be determined via an inverse problem
from the two sets of data; ii) correlations decay as $1/N_{eff}$, where
$N_{eff}$ is a small fraction of the mean number of Twitts; iii) the simplest
statistical models that reproduce these correlations are the multinomial
distribution (MD), characterized by $q$ external fields, and the mean-field
Potts model (MFP), characterized by one coupling; iv) remarkably, this coupling
turns out to be always close to its critical value. This results in a MD or MFP
model scenario that discriminates between cases in which polls are reliable and
not reliable, respectively. More precisely, predictions based on polls should
be avoided whenever the data maps to a MFP because anomalous large fluctuations
(if $q=2$) or sudden jumps (if $q\geq 3$) in the trends might take place as a
result of a second-order or a first-order phase transition of the MFP,

influencing the election by selecting the location of polling places, as many

selection of polling places on the line, it becomes difficult already on the
plane or in the case of more than two candidates. Moreover, we show that for

absenteeism. While the demand uncertainty is exogenous (stemming from the
random patient census), the absenteeism uncertainty is \emph{endogenous}, i.e.,
the number of nurses who show up for work partially depends on the nurse
staffing level. For quality of care, many hospitals have developed float pools,
i.e., groups of hospital units, and trained nurses to be able to work in
multiple units (termed cross-training) in response to potential nurse shortage.
In this paper, we propose a distributionally robust nurse staffing (DRNS) model
that considers both exogenous and endogenous uncertainties. We derive a
separation algorithm to solve this model under a general structure of float
pools. In addition, we identify several pool structures that often arise in
practice and recast the corresponding DRNS model as a mixed-integer linear
program, which facilitates off-the-shelf commercial solvers. Furthermore, we
optimize the float pool design to reduce cross-training while achieving
specified target staffing costs. The numerical case studies, based on the data

decoding is optimal, i.e., joint decoding of the bee barcodes does not result
in a better error exponent relative to independent decoding of each noisy
barcode. This is in contrast to the result without absentee bees, where joint
barcode decoding results in a significantly higher error exponent than

194,Mining the Demographics of Political Sentiment from Twitter Using Learning from Label Proportions,"Opinion mining and demographic attribute inference have many applications in
social science. In this paper, we propose models to infer daily joint
probabilities of multiple latent attributes from Twitter data, such as
political sentiment and demographic attributes. Since it is costly and
time-consuming to annotate data for traditional supervised classification, we
instead propose scalable Learning from Label Proportions (LLP) models for
demographic and opinion inference using U.S. Census, national and state
political polls, and Cook partisan voting index as population level data. In
LLP classification settings, the training data is divided into a set of
unlabeled bags, where only the label distribution in of each bag is known,
removing the requirement of instance-level annotations. Our proposed LLP model,
Weighted Label Regularization (WLR), provides a scalable generalization of
prior work on label regularization to support weights for samples inside bags,
which is applicable in this setting where bags are arranged hierarchically
(e.g., county-level bags are nested inside of state-level bags). We apply our
model to Twitter data collected in the year leading up to the 2016 U.S.
presidential election, producing estimates of the relationships among political
sentiment and demographics over time and place. We find that our approach
closely tracks traditional polling data stratified by demographic category,
resulting in error reductions of 28-44% over baseline approaches. We also
provide descriptive evaluations showing how the model may be used to estimate
interactions among many variables and to identify linguistic temporal
variation, capabilities which are typically not feasible using traditional
polling methods.",1708.08000v1,cs.SI,2017-08-26 17:48:20+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Ehsan Mohammady Ardehaly'), arxiv.Result.Author('Aron Culotta')]",
195,Metronome: adaptive and precise intermittent packet retrieval in DPDK,"The increasing performance requirements of modern applications place a
significant burden on software-based packet processing. Most of today's
software input/output accelerations achieve high performance at the expense of
reserving CPU resources dedicated to continuously poll the Network Interface
Card. This is specifically the case with DPDK (Data Plane Development Kit),
probably the most widely used framework for software-based packet processing
today. The approach presented in this paper, descriptively called Metronome,
has the dual goals of providing CPU utilization proportional to the load, and
allowing flexible sharing of CPU resources between I/O tasks and applications.
Metronome replaces DPDK's continuous polling with an intermittent sleep&wake
mode, and revolves around a new multi-threaded operation, which improves
service continuity. Since the proposed operation trades CPU usage with
buffering delay, we propose an analytical model devised to dynamically adapt
the sleep&wake parameters to the actual traffic load, meanwhile providing a
target average latency. Our experimental results show a significant reduction
of the CPU cycles, improvements in power usage, and robustness to CPU sharing
even when challenged with CPU-intensive applications.",2103.13263v3,cs.NI,2021-03-24 15:27:24+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Marco Faltelli'), arxiv.Result.Author('Giacomo Belocchi'), arxiv.Result.Author('Francesco Quaglia'), arxiv.Result.Author('Salvatore Pontarelli'), arxiv.Result.Author('Giuseppe Bianchi')]",
196,Integration of a machine learning model into a decision support tool to predict absenteeism at work of prospective employees,"Purpose - Inefficient hiring may result in lower productivity and higher
training costs. Productivity losses caused by absenteeism at work cost U.S.
employers billions of dollars each year. Also, employers typically spend a
considerable amount of time managing employees who perform poorly. The purpose
of this study is to develop a decision support tool to predict absenteeism
among potential employees. Design/methodology/approach - We utilized a popular
open-access dataset. In order to categorize absenteeism classes, the data have
been preprocessed, and four methods of machine learning classification have
been applied: Multinomial Logistic Regression (MLR), Support Vector Machines
(SVM), Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), and Random Forests (RF). We selected
the best model, based on several validation scores, and compared its
performance against the existing model; we then integrated the best model into
our proposed web-based for hiring managers. Findings - A web-based decision
tool allows hiring managers to make more informed decisions before hiring a
potential employee, thus reducing time, financial loss and reducing the
probability of economic insolvency. Originality/value - In this paper, we
propose a model that is trained based on attributes that can be collected
during the hiring process. Furthermore, hiring managers may lack experience in
machine learning or do not have the time to spend developing machine learning
algorithms. Thus, we propose a web-based interactive tool that can be used
without prior knowledge of machine learning algorithms.",2202.03577v1,cs.LG,2022-02-02 03:49:01+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Gopal Nath'), arxiv.Result.Author('Antoine Harfouche'), arxiv.Result.Author('Austin Coursey'), arxiv.Result.Author('Krishna K.

197,Evidence of Systematic Bias in 2008 Presidential Polling (preliminary report),"Political polls achieve their results by sampling a small number of potential
voters rather than the population as a whole. This leads to sampling error
which most polling agencies dutifully report. But factors such as
nonrepresentative samples, question wording and nonresponse can produce
non-sampling errors. While pollsters are aware of such errors, they are
difficult to quantify and seldom reported. When a polling agency, whether by
intention or not, produces results with non-sampling errors that systematically
favor one candidate over another, then that agency's poll is biased. We
analyzed polling data for the (on-going) 2008 Presidential race, and though our
methods do not allow us to identify which agencies' polls are biased, they do
provide significant evidence that some agencies' polls are.
  We compared polls produced by major television networks with those produced
by Gallup and Rasmussen. We found that, taken as a whole, polls produced by the
networks were significantly to the left of those produced by Gallup and
Rasmussen. We used the available data to provide a tentative ordering of the
major television networks' polls from right to left. Our order was: FOX, CNN,
NBC (which partners with the Wall Street Journal), ABC (which partners with the
Washington Post), CBS (which partners with the New York Times). These results
appear to comport well with the informal perceptions of the political leanings
of these agencies.
  Our findings are preliminary, but they make a case for further research into
the causes of and remedies for polling bias.",0810.5603v1,stat.AP,2008-10-30 07:18:23+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Leonard Adleman'), arxiv.Result.Author('Mark Schilling')]",
198,Adaptive Polling in Hierarchical Social Networks using Blackwell Dominance,"Consider a population of individuals that observe an underlying state of
nature that evolves over time. The population is classified into different
levels depending on the hierarchical influence that dictates how the
individuals at each level form an opinion on the state. The population is
sampled sequentially by a pollster and the nodes (or individuals) respond to
the questions asked by the pollster. This paper considers the following
problem: How should the pollster poll the hierarchical social network to
estimate the state while minimizing the polling cost (measurement cost and
uncertainty in the Bayesian state estimate)? This paper proposes adaptive
versions of the following polling methods: Intent Polling, Expectation Polling,
and the recently proposed Neighbourhood Expectation Polling to account for the
time varying state of nature and the hierarchical influence in social networks.
The adaptive polling problem in a hierarchical social network is formulated as
a partially observed Markov decision process (POMDP). Our main results exploit
the structure of the polling problem, and determine novel conditions for
Blackwell dominance to construct myopic policies that provably upper bound the
optimal policy of the adaptive polling POMDP. The LeCam deficiency is used to
determine approximate Blackwell dominance for general polling problems. These
Blackwell dominance conditions also facilitate the comparison of Renyi
Divergence and Shannon capacity of more general channel structures that arise
in hierarchical social networks. Numerical examples are provided to illustrate
the adaptive polling policies with parameters estimated from YouTube data.",1810.00571v1,cs.SI,2018-10-01 08:23:38+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Sujay Bhatt'), arxiv.Result.Author('Vikram Krishnamurthy')]",
199,Using Online Implicit Association Tests in Opinion Polling,"Opinion polls have now become a very important component of society because
they are now a defacto component of our daily news cycle and because their
results influence governments and business in ways which are not always obvious
to us. However, polling is not always accurate and there have been some really
inaccurate polling results which have had major influences on the world going
back to the 1930s but also as recently as just the last 3 or 4 years. In this
paper we analyse the phenomenon of socially desirable responding (shy voters)
which has emerged as one of the reasons for modern day inaccurate polling. We
describe how it can be exposed through implicit association tests (IATs) and we
demonstrate the shy voter effect in a small survey on opinions in Ireland
towards the United Kingdom. We argue for inclusion of IATs in traditional
polling and point to the fact that these can be conducted accurately online,
which also allows polling to reach a larger and more diverse sample of
respondents in the days of Covid-19 restrictions which restricts the
opportunities for poll sampling from the general public.",2007.04183v1,cs.CY,2020-07-08 15:16:15+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Alan Smeaton'), arxiv.Result.Author('Hyowon Lee'), arxiv.Result.Author('Niamh Morris'), arxiv.Result.Author('David Hanley')]",
