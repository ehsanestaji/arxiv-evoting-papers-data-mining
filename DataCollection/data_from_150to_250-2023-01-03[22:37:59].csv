0,Limiting Risk by Turning Manifest Phantoms into Evil Zombies,"Drawing a random sample of ballots to conduct a risk-limiting audit generally
requires knowing how the ballots cast in an election are organized into groups,
for instance, how many containers of ballots there are in all and how many
ballots are in each container. A list of the ballot group identifiers along
with number of ballots in each group is called a ballot manifest. What if the
ballot manifest is not accurate? Surprisingly, even if ballots are known to be
missing from the manifest, it is not necessary to make worst-case assumptions
about those ballots--for instance, to adjust the margin by the number of
missing ballots--to ensure that the audit remains conservative. Rather, it
suffices to make worst-case assumptions about the individual randomly selected
ballots that the audit cannot find. This observation provides a simple
modification to some risk-limiting audit procedures that makes them
automatically become more conservative if the ballot manifest has errors. The
modification--phantoms to evil zombies (~2EZ)--requires only an upper bound on
the total number of ballots cast. ~2EZ makes the audit P-value stochastically
larger than it would be had the manifest been accurate, automatically requiring
more than enough ballots to be audited to offset the manifest errors. This
ensures that the true risk limit remains smaller than the nominal risk limit.
On the other hand, if the manifest is in fact accurate and the upper bound on
the total number of ballots equals the total according to the manifest, ~2EZ
has no effect at all on the number of ballots audited nor on the true risk
limit.",1207.3413v1,stat.AP,2012-07-14 11:26:02+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Jorge H. Banuelos'), arxiv.Result.Author('Philip B. Stark')]",
1,A Complete Enumeration of Ballot Permutations Avoiding Sets of Small Patterns,"Permutations whose prefixes contain at least as many ascents as descents are
called ballot permutations. Lin, Wang, and Zhao have previously enumerated
ballot permutations avoiding small patterns and have proposed the problem of
enumerating ballot permutations avoiding a pair of permutations of length $3$.
We completely enumerate ballot permutations avoiding two patterns of length $3$
and we relate these avoidance classes with their respective recurrence
relations and formulas, which leads to an interesting bijection between ballot
permutations avoiding $132$ and $312$ with left factors of Dyck paths. In
addition, we also conclude the Wilf-classification of ballot permutations
avoiding sets of two patterns of length $3$, and we then extend our results to
completely enumerate ballot permutations avoiding three patterns of length $3$.",2209.06087v1,math.CO,2022-09-13 15:37:45+00:00,[arxiv.Result.Author('Nathan Sun')],
2,Can Voters Detect Errors on Their Printed Ballots? Absolutely,"There is still debate on whether voters can detect malicious changes in their
printed ballot after making their selections on a Ballot Marking Device (BMD).
In this study, we altered votes on a voter's ballot after they had made their
selections on a BMD. We then required them to examine their ballots for any
changes from the slate they used to vote. Overall accuracy was exceptionally
high. Participants saw 1440 total contests, and of those 1440, there were a
total of 4 errors, so total accuracy was 99.8%. Participants were able to
perform with near-perfect accuracy regardless of ballot length, ballot type,
number of altered races, and location of altered races. Detection performance
was extremely robust. We conclude that with proper direction and resources,
voters can be near-perfect detectors of ballot changes on printed paper ballots
after voting with a BMD. This finding has significant implications for the
voting community as BMD use continues to grow. Research should now focus on
identifying administrative and behavioral methods that will prompt and

4,Sophisticated Attacks on Decoy Ballots: The Devil's Menu and the Market for Lemons,"Decoy ballots do not count in election outcomes, but otherwise they are
indistinguishable from real ballots. By means of a game-theoretical model, we
show that decoy ballots may not provide effective protection against a
malevolent adversary trying to buy real ballots. If the citizenry is divided
into subgroups (or districts), the adversary can construct a so-called ""Devil's
Menu"" consisting of several prices. In equilibrium, the adversary can buy the
real ballots of any strict subset of districts at a price corresponding to the
willingness to sell on the part of the citizens holding such ballots. By
contrast, decoy voters are trapped into selling their ballots at a low, or even
negligible, price. Blowing up the adversary's budget by introducing decoy
ballots may thus turn out to be futile. The Devil's Menu can also be applied to
the well-known ""Lemons Problem"".",1712.05477v1,cs.GT,2017-12-14 23:54:58+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Hans Gersbach'), arxiv.Result.Author('Akaki Mamageishvili'), arxiv.Result.Author('Oriol Tejada')]",
5,The ATHENA Class of Risk-Limiting Ballot Polling Audits,"The main risk-limiting ballot polling audit in use today, BRAVO, is designed
for use when single ballots are drawn at random and a decision regarding
whether to stop the audit or draw another ballot is taken after each ballot
draw (ballot-by-ballot (B2) audits). On the other hand, real ballot polling
audits draw many ballots in a single round before determining whether to stop
(round-by-round (R2) audits). We show that BRAVO results in significant
inefficiency when directly applied to real R2 audits. We present the ATHENA
class of R2 stopping rules, which we show are risk-limiting if the round
schedule is pre-determined (before the audit begins). We prove that each rule
is at least as efficient as the corresponding BRAVO stopping rule applied at
the end of the round. We have open-source software libraries implementing most
of our results.
  We show that ATHENA halves the number of ballots required, for all state
margins in the 2016 US Presidential election and a first round with $90\%$
stopping probability, when compared to BRAVO (stopping rule applied at the end
of the round). We present simulation results supporting the 90% stopping
probability claims and our claims for the risk accrued in the first round.
Further, ATHENA reduces the number of ballots by more than a quarter for low
margins, when compared to the BRAVO stopping rule applied on ballots in
selection order. This implies that keeping track of the order when drawing
ballots R2 is not beneficial, because ATHENA is more efficient even without
information on selection order. These results are significant because current
approaches to real ballot polling election audits use the B2 BRAVO rules,
requiring about twice as much work on the part of election officials. Applying
the rules in selection order requires fewer ballots, but keeping track of the
order, and entering it into audit software, adds to the effort.",2008.02315v5,cs.CR,2020-08-05 18:47:37+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Filip Zagórski'), arxiv.Result.Author('Grant McClearn'), arxiv.Result.Author('Sarah Morin'), arxiv.Result.Author('Neal McBurnett'), arxiv.Result.Author('Poorvi L.

6,$k$-Cut: A Simple Approximately-Uniform Method for Sampling Ballots in Post-Election Audits,"We present an approximate sampling framework and discuss how risk-limiting
audits can compensate for these approximations, while maintaining their
""risk-limiting"" properties. Our framework is general and can compensate for
counting mistakes made during audits.
  Moreover, we present and analyze a simple approximate sampling
method,""$k$-cut"", for picking a ballot randomly from a stack, without counting.
Our method involves doing $k$ ""cuts"", each involving moving a random portion of
ballots from the top to the bottom of the stack, and then picking the ballot on
top. Unlike conventional methods of picking a ballot at random, $k$-cut does
not require identification numbers on the ballots or counting many ballots per
draw. We analyze how close the distribution of chosen ballots is to the uniform
distribution, and design different mitigation procedures. We show that $k=6$
cuts is enough for an risk-limiting election audit, based on empirical data,
which would provide a significant increase in efficiency.",1811.08811v3,cs.DS,2018-11-21 16:26:33+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Mayuri Sridhar'), arxiv.Result.Author('Ronald L. Rivest')]",
7,Bernoulli Ballot Polling: A Manifest Improvement for Risk-Limiting Audits,"We present a method and software for ballot-polling risk-limiting audits
(RLAs) based on Bernoulli sampling: ballots are included in the sample with
probability $p$, independently. Bernoulli sampling has several advantages: (1)
it does not require a ballot manifest; (2) it can be conducted independently at
different locations, rather than requiring a central authority to select the
sample from the whole population of cast ballots or requiring stratified
sampling; (3) it can start in polling places on election night, before margins
are known. If the reported margins for the 2016 U.S. Presidential election are
correct, a Bernoulli ballot-polling audit with a risk limit of 5% and a
sampling rate of $p_0 = 1\%$ would have had at least a 99% probability of
confirming the outcome in 42 states. (The other states were more likely to have
needed to examine additional ballots.) Logistical and security advantages that
auditing in the polling place affords may outweigh the cost of examining more
ballots than some other methods might require.",1812.06361v1,stat.AP,2018-12-15 21:57:23+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Kellie Ottoboni'), arxiv.Result.Author('Matthew Bernhard'), arxiv.Result.Author('J.

8,"Symmetric Dyck tilings, ballot tableaux and tree-like tableaux of shifted shapes","Symmetric Dyck tilings and ballot tilings are certain tilings in the region
surrounded by two ballot paths. We study the relations of combinatorial objects
which are bijective to symmetric Dyck tilings such as labeled trees, Hermite
histories, and perfect matchings. We also introduce two operations on labeled
trees for symmetric Dyck tilings: symmetric Dyck tiling strip (symDTS) and
symmetric Dyck tiling ribbon (symDTR). We give two definitions of Hermite
histories for symmetric Dyck tilings, and show that they are equivalent by use
of the correspondence between symDTS operation and an Hermite history. Since
ballot tilings form a subset in the set of symmetric Dyck tilings, we construct
an inclusive map from labeled trees for ballot tilings to labeled trees for
symmetric Dyck tilings. By this inclusive map, the results for symmetric Dyck
tilings can be applied to those of ballot tilings. We introduce and study the
notions of ballot tableaux and tree-like tableaux of shifted shapes, which are
generalizations of Dyck tableaux and tree-like tableaux, respectively. The
correspondence between ballot tableaux and tree-like tableaux of shifted shapes
is given by using the symDTR operation and the structure of labeled trees for
symmetric Dyck tilings.",2011.07296v1,math.CO,2020-11-14 13:15:14+00:00,[arxiv.Result.Author('Keiichi Shigechi')],
9,SOBA: Secrecy-preserving Observable Ballot-level Audit,"SOBA is an approach to election verification that provides observers with
justifiably high confidence that the reported results of an election are
consistent with an audit trail (""ballots""), which can be paper or electronic.
SOBA combines three ideas: (1) publishing cast vote records (CVRs) separately
for each contest, so that anyone can verify that each reported contest outcome
is correct, if the CVRs reflect voters' intentions with sufficient accuracy;
(2) shrouding a mapping between ballots and the CVRs for those ballots to
prevent the loss of privacy that could occur otherwise; (3) assessing the
accuracy with which the CVRs reflect voters' intentions for a collection of
contests while simultaneously assessing the integrity of the shrouded mapping
between ballots and CVRs by comparing randomly selected ballots to the CVRs
that purport to represent them. Step (1) is related to work by the Humboldt
County Election Transparency Project, but publishing CVRs separately for
individual contests rather than images of entire ballots preserves privacy.
Step (2) requires a cryptographic commitment from elections officials.
Observers participate in step (3), which relies on the ""super-simple
simultaneous single-ballot risk-limiting audit."" Step (3) is designed to reveal
relatively few ballots if the shrouded mapping is proper and the CVRs
accurately reflect voter intent. But if the reported outcomes of the contests
differ from the outcomes that a full hand count would show, step (3) is
guaranteed to have a large chance of requiring all the ballots to be counted by
hand, thereby limiting the risk that an incorrect outcome will become official
and final.",1105.5803v2,stat.AP,2011-05-29 17:00:20+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Josh Benaloh'), arxiv.Result.Author('Douglas Jones'), arxiv.Result.Author('Eric Lazarus'), arxiv.Result.Author('Mark Lindeman'), arxiv.Result.Author('Philip B. Stark')]",
10,"Voter Verification of BMD Ballots Is a Two-Part Question: Can They? Mostly, They Can. Do They? Mostly, They Don't","The question of whether or not voters actually verify ballots produced by
ballot marking devices (BMDs) is presently the subject of some controversy.
Recent studies (e.g., Bernhard, et al. 2020) suggest the verification rate is
low. What is not clear from previous research is whether this is more a result
of voters being unable to do so accurately or whether this is because voters
simply choose not to attempt verification in the first place. In order to
understand this problem, we conducted an experiment in which 108 participants
participated in a mock election where the BMD displayed the voters' true
choices, but then changed a subset of those choices on the printed ballot. The
design of the printed ballot, the length of the ballot, the number of changes
that were made to the ballot, the location of those changes, and the
instructions provided to the voters were manipulated as part of the experiment.
Results indicated that of those voters who chose to examine the printed ballot,
76% detected anomalies, indicating that voters can reliably detect errors on
their ballot if they will simply review it. This suggests that administrative
remedies, rather than attempts to alter fundamental human perceptual
capabilities, could be employed to encourage voters to check their ballots,
which could prove as an effective countermeasure.",2003.04997v1,cs.HC,2020-03-10 21:06:42+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Philip Kortum'), arxiv.Result.Author('Michael D. Byrne'), arxiv.Result.Author('Julie Whitmore')]",
11,Next Steps for the Colorado Risk-Limiting Audit (CORLA) Program,"Colorado conducted risk-limiting tabulation audits (RLAs) across the state in

Those audits only covered contests restricted to a single county; methods to
efficiently audit contests that cross county boundaries and combine ballot
polling and ballot-level comparisons have not been available.
  Colorado's current audit software (RLATool) needs to be improved to audit
these contests that cross county lines and to audit small contests efficiently.
  This paper addresses these needs. It presents extremely simple but
inefficient methods, more efficient methods that combine ballot polling and
ballot-level comparisons using stratified samples, and methods that combine
ballot-level comparison and variable-size batch comparison audits in a way that
does not require stratified sampling.
  We conclude with some recommendations, and illustrate our recommended method

12,RAIRE: Risk-Limiting Audits for IRV Elections,"Risk-limiting post election audits guarantee a high probability of correcting
incorrect election results, independent of why the result was incorrect.
Ballot-polling audits select ballots at random and interpret those ballots as
evidence for and against the reported result, continuing this process until
either they support the recorded result, or they fall back to a full manual
recount. For elections with digitised scanning and counting of ballots, a
comparison audit compares randomly selected digital ballots with their paper
versions. Discrepancies are referred to as errors, and are used to build
evidence against or in support of the recorded result. Risk-limiting audits for
first-past-the-post elections are well understood, and used in some US
elections. We define a number of approaches to ballot-polling and comparison
risk-limiting audits for Instant Runoff Voting (IRV) elections. We show that
for almost all real elections we found, we can perform a risk-limiting audit by
looking at only a small fraction of the total ballots (assuming no errors were
made in the tallying and distribution of votes).",1903.08804v2,cs.DS,2019-03-20 06:19:10+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Michelle Blom'), arxiv.Result.Author('Peter J. Stuckey'), arxiv.Result.Author('Vanessa Teague')]",

also preserves the neighbors of the largest letter in permutations and thus
resolves a refinement of Spiro' s conjecture proposed by Wang and Zhang. Our
decomposition can be extended to well-labelled positive paths, a class of
generalized ballot permutations arising from polytope theory, that were
enumerated by Bernardi, Duplantier and Nadeau. We will also investigate the

14,Ballot Length in Instant Runoff Voting,"Instant runoff voting (IRV) is an increasingly-popular alternative to
traditional plurality voting in which voters submit rankings over the
candidates rather than single votes. In practice, elections using IRV often
restrict the ballot length, the number of candidates a voter is allowed to rank
on their ballot. We theoretically and empirically analyze how ballot length can
influence the outcome of an election, given fixed voter preferences. We show
that there exist preference profiles over $k$ candidates such that up to $k-1$
different candidates win at different ballot lengths. We derive exact lower
bounds on the number of voters required for such profiles and provide a
construction matching the lower bound for unrestricted voter preferences.
Additionally, we characterize which sequences of winners are possible over
ballot lengths and provide explicit profile constructions achieving any
feasible winner sequence. We also examine how classic preference restrictions
influence our results--for instance, single-peakedness makes $k-1$ different
winners impossible but still allows at least $\Omega(\sqrt k)$. Finally, we
analyze a collection of 168 real-world elections, where we truncate rankings to
simulate shorter ballots. We find that shorter ballots could have changed the
outcome in one quarter of these elections. Our results highlight ballot length
as a consequential degree of freedom in the design of IRV elections.",2207.08958v3,cs.MA,2022-07-18 22:01:13+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Kiran Tomlinson'), arxiv.Result.Author('Johan Ugander'), arxiv.Result.Author('Jon Kleinberg')]",

(round-by-round (R2) audits). We show that BRAVO results in significant
inefficiency when directly applied to real R2 audits. We present the ATHENA
class of R2 stopping rules, which we show are risk-limiting if the round
schedule is pre-determined (before the audit begins). We prove that each rule
is at least as efficient as the corresponding BRAVO stopping rule applied at
the end of the round. We have open-source software libraries implementing most
of our results.
  We show that ATHENA halves the number of ballots required, for all state
margins in the 2016 US Presidential election and a first round with $90\%$
stopping probability, when compared to BRAVO (stopping rule applied at the end
of the round). We present simulation results supporting the 90% stopping
probability claims and our claims for the risk accrued in the first round.
Further, ATHENA reduces the number of ballots by more than a quarter for low
margins, when compared to the BRAVO stopping rule applied on ballots in
selection order. This implies that keeping track of the order when drawing
ballots R2 is not beneficial, because ATHENA is more efficient even without
information on selection order. These results are significant because current
approaches to real ballot polling election audits use the B2 BRAVO rules,
requiring about twice as much work on the part of election officials. Applying
the rules in selection order requires fewer ballots, but keeping track of the
order, and entering it into audit software, adds to the effort.",2008.02315v5,cs.CR,2020-08-05 18:47:37+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Filip Zagórski'), arxiv.Result.Author('Grant McClearn'), arxiv.Result.Author('Sarah Morin'), arxiv.Result.Author('Neal McBurnett'), arxiv.Result.Author('Poorvi L.

26,$k$-Cut: A Simple Approximately-Uniform Method for Sampling Ballots in Post-Election Audits,"We present an approximate sampling framework and discuss how risk-limiting

Our method involves doing $k$ ""cuts"", each involving moving a random portion of
ballots from the top to the bottom of the stack, and then picking the ballot on
top. Unlike conventional methods of picking a ballot at random, $k$-cut does
not require identification numbers on the ballots or counting many ballots per

it does not require a ballot manifest; (2) it can be conducted independently at
different locations, rather than requiring a central authority to select the
sample from the whole population of cast ballots or requiring stratified
sampling; (3) it can start in polling places on election night, before margins
are known. If the reported margins for the 2016 U.S. Presidential election are
correct, a Bernoulli ballot-polling audit with a risk limit of 5% and a
sampling rate of $p_0 = 1\%$ would have had at least a 99% probability of
confirming the outcome in 42 states. (The other states were more likely to have
needed to examine additional ballots.) Logistical and security advantages that
auditing in the polling place affords may outweigh the cost of examining more

29,SOBA: Secrecy-preserving Observable Ballot-level Audit,"SOBA is an approach to election verification that provides observers with
justifiably high confidence that the reported results of an election are
consistent with an audit trail (""ballots""), which can be paper or electronic.
SOBA combines three ideas: (1) publishing cast vote records (CVRs) separately
for each contest, so that anyone can verify that each reported contest outcome
is correct, if the CVRs reflect voters' intentions with sufficient accuracy;
(2) shrouding a mapping between ballots and the CVRs for those ballots to
prevent the loss of privacy that could occur otherwise; (3) assessing the
accuracy with which the CVRs reflect voters' intentions for a collection of
contests while simultaneously assessing the integrity of the shrouded mapping
between ballots and CVRs by comparing randomly selected ballots to the CVRs
that purport to represent them. Step (1) is related to work by the Humboldt
County Election Transparency Project, but publishing CVRs separately for
individual contests rather than images of entire ballots preserves privacy.
Step (2) requires a cryptographic commitment from elections officials.
Observers participate in step (3), which relies on the ""super-simple
simultaneous single-ballot risk-limiting audit."" Step (3) is designed to reveal
relatively few ballots if the shrouded mapping is proper and the CVRs
accurately reflect voter intent. But if the reported outcomes of the contests
differ from the outcomes that a full hand count would show, step (3) is
guaranteed to have a large chance of requiring all the ballots to be counted by
hand, thereby limiting the risk that an incorrect outcome will become official

30,"Voter Verification of BMD Ballots Is a Two-Part Question: Can They? Mostly, They Can. Do They? Mostly, They Don't","The question of whether or not voters actually verify ballots produced by
ballot marking devices (BMDs) is presently the subject of some controversy.
Recent studies (e.g., Bernhard, et al. 2020) suggest the verification rate is
low. What is not clear from previous research is whether this is more a result
of voters being unable to do so accurately or whether this is because voters
simply choose not to attempt verification in the first place. In order to
understand this problem, we conducted an experiment in which 108 participants
participated in a mock election where the BMD displayed the voters' true
choices, but then changed a subset of those choices on the printed ballot. The
design of the printed ballot, the length of the ballot, the number of changes
that were made to the ballot, the location of those changes, and the
instructions provided to the voters were manipulated as part of the experiment.
Results indicated that of those voters who chose to examine the printed ballot,
76% detected anomalies, indicating that voters can reliably detect errors on
their ballot if they will simply review it. This suggests that administrative
remedies, rather than attempts to alter fundamental human perceptual
capabilities, could be employed to encourage voters to check their ballots,

31,Cyber-Risks in Paper Voting,"Paper ballot voting with its fully-reviewable paper-trail is usually
considered as more secure than their e-voting counterparts, given the large
number of recent incidents. In this work, we explore the security of paper
voting and show that paper voting, as it is implemented today, is surprisingly
vulnerable to cyber-attacks. In particular, the aggregation methods of
preliminary voting results of various countries rely on insecure communication
channels like telephone, fax or non-secure e-mail. Furthermore, regulations
typically do not mandate the use of secure channels for the transmission of
preliminary results. We illustrate that preliminary results, despite their
temporary nature, may have a severe impact on real-world decisions during the 3
to 30 days window until the final results are declared. An attacker exploiting
this discrepancy can, e.g., benefit from stock market manipulation or call into
question the legitimacy of the elections. This work investigates the
cyber-risks in paper voting in a systematic manner by reviewing procedures in
several countries (Estonia, France, Germany, the United Kingdom, and the United
States of America) and through a comprehensive case-study of Switzerland. We
examine the transmission systems currently in use through inquires from
election officials. Moreover, we illustrate the feasibility of attacks by
analyzing the frequent historical discrepancies between preliminary and final
results. Considering our results and recent reports about easily modifiable
preliminary results in Germany and the Netherlands, we conjecture similar
weaknesses in other countries as well.",1906.07532v3,cs.CR,2019-06-18 12:41:23+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('David M. Sommer'), arxiv.Result.Author('Moritz Schneider'), arxiv.Result.Author('Jannik Gut'), arxiv.Result.Author('Srdjan Capkun')]",

construction matching the lower bound for unrestricted voter preferences.
Additionally, we characterize which sequences of winners are possible over

feasible winner sequence. We also examine how classic preference restrictions

52,Limiting Risk by Turning Manifest Phantoms into Evil Zombies,"Drawing a random sample of ballots to conduct a risk-limiting audit generally
requires knowing how the ballots cast in an election are organized into groups,
for instance, how many containers of ballots there are in all and how many
ballots are in each container. A list of the ballot group identifiers along
with number of ballots in each group is called a ballot manifest. What if the
ballot manifest is not accurate? Surprisingly, even if ballots are known to be
missing from the manifest, it is not necessary to make worst-case assumptions
about those ballots--for instance, to adjust the margin by the number of
missing ballots--to ensure that the audit remains conservative. Rather, it
suffices to make worst-case assumptions about the individual randomly selected
ballots that the audit cannot find. This observation provides a simple
modification to some risk-limiting audit procedures that makes them
automatically become more conservative if the ballot manifest has errors. The
modification--phantoms to evil zombies (~2EZ)--requires only an upper bound on
the total number of ballots cast. ~2EZ makes the audit P-value stochastically
larger than it would be had the manifest been accurate, automatically requiring
more than enough ballots to be audited to offset the manifest errors. This
ensures that the true risk limit remains smaller than the nominal risk limit.
On the other hand, if the manifest is in fact accurate and the upper bound on
the total number of ballots equals the total according to the manifest, ~2EZ
has no effect at all on the number of ballots audited nor on the true risk
limit.",1207.3413v1,stat.AP,2012-07-14 11:26:02+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Jorge H. Banuelos'), arxiv.Result.Author('Philip B. Stark')]",
53,Sets of Half-Average Nulls Generate Risk-Limiting Audits: SHANGRLA,"Risk-limiting audits (RLAs) for many social choice functions can be reduced
to testing sets of null hypotheses of the form ""the average of this list is not
greater than 1/2"" for a collection of finite lists of nonnegative numbers. Such
social choice functions include majority, super-majority, plurality,
multi-winner plurality, Instant Runoff Voting (IRV), Borda count, approval
voting, and STAR-Voting, among others. The audit stops without a full hand
count iff all the null hypotheses are rejected. The nulls can be tested in many
ways. Ballot-polling is particularly simple; two new ballot-polling
risk-measuring functions for sampling without replacement are given.
Ballot-level comparison audits transform each null into an equivalent assertion
that the mean of re-scaled tabulation errors is not greater than 1/2. In turn,
that null can then be tested using the same statistical methods used for ballot
polling---but applied to different finite lists of nonnegative numbers.
SHANGRLA comparison audits are more efficient than previous comparison audits
for two reasons: (i) for most social choice functions, the conditions tested
are both necessary and sufficient for the reported outcome to be correct, while
previous methods tested conditions that were sufficient but not necessary, and
(ii) the tests avoid a conservative approximation. The SHANGRLA abstraction
simplifies stratified audits, including audits that combine ballot polling with
ballot-level comparisons, producing sharper audits than the ""SUITE"" approach.
SHANGRLA works with the ""phantoms to evil zombies"" strategy to treat missing
ballot cards and missing or redacted cast vote records. That also facilitates
sampling from ""ballot-style manifests,"" which can dramatically improve
efficiency when the audited contests do not appear on every ballot card.
Open-source software implementing SHANGRLA ballot-level comparison audits is

convective envelope of a young (10 Myr) one-solar-mass star, obtained with the
Anelastic Spherical Harmonic code. Since young stars are known to be faster
rotators than their main sequence counterparts, we have systematically studied
the impact of the stellar rotation speed, by considering stars spinning up to
five times as fast as the Sun. The aim of these nonlinear models is to
understand the complex interactions between convection and rotation. We discuss
the influence of the turbulence level and of the rotation rate on the intensity
and the topology of the mean flows. For all of the computed models, we find a
solar-type superficial differential rotation, with an equatorial acceleration,
and meridional circulation that exhibits a multicellular structure. Even if the
differential rotation contrast decreases only marginally for high rotation
rates, the meridional circulation intensity clearly weakens according to our
simulations. We have also shown that, for Taylor numbers above a certain
threshold (Ta>10^9), the convection can develop a vacillating behavior. Since
simulations with high turbulence levels and rotation rates exhibit strongly
cylindrical internal rotation profiles, we have considered the influence of
baroclinic effects at the base of the convective envelope of these young Suns,
to see whether such effect can modify the otherwise near cylindrical profiles
to produce more conical, solar-like profiles.",0707.3943v1,astro-ph,2007-07-26 15:06:32+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Jérôme Ballot'), arxiv.Result.Author('Allan Sacha Brun'), arxiv.Result.Author('Sylvaine Turck-Chièze')]","ApJ 669, 1190 (Nov 10, 2007)"

initial exploration of boardroom elections with ballot privacy and voter
verifiability that use only ""low-tech cryptography"" without using computers to
mark or collect ballots. Specifically, we define the problem, introduce several
building blocks, and propose a new protocol that combines these blocks in novel
ways. Our new building blocks include ""foldable ballots"" that can be rotated to
hide the alignment of ballot choices with voting marks, and ""visual secrets""
that are easy to remember and use but hard to describe. Although closely seated
participants in a boardroom election have limited privacy, the protocol ensures
that no one can determine how others voted. Moreover, each voter can verify
that their ballot was correctly cast, collected, and counted, without being
able to prove how they voted, providing assurance against undue influence.
Low-tech cryptography is useful in situations where constituents do not trust
computer technology, and it avoids the complex auditing requirements of
end-to-end cryptographic voting systems such as Pr\^{e}t-\`{a}-Voter. This
paper's building blocks and protocol are meant to be a proof of concept that

perform with near-perfect accuracy regardless of ballot length, ballot type,

was extremely robust. We conclude that with proper direction and resources,
voters can be near-perfect detectors of ballot changes on printed paper ballots

bidirectional ballot sequences which we call bidirectional gerrymanders, and
show that the set of bidirectional gerrymanders form a convex polytope sitting
inside the unit cube, which we refer to as the bidirectional ballot polytope.
We prove that every $(2n-1)$-dimensional unit cube can be partitioned into
$2n-1$ isometric copies of the $(2n-1)$-dimensional bidirectional ballot
polytope. Furthermore, we show that the vertices of this polytope are all also
vertices of the cube, and that the vertices are in bijection with BBS's. An

whether to stop the audit or draw another ballot is taken after each ballot
draw (ballot-by-ballot (B2) audits). On the other hand, real ballot polling
audits draw many ballots in a single round before determining whether to stop
(round-by-round (R2) audits). We show that BRAVO results in significant
inefficiency when directly applied to real R2 audits. We present the ATHENA
class of R2 stopping rules, which we show are risk-limiting if the round
schedule is pre-determined (before the audit begins). We prove that each rule
is at least as efficient as the corresponding BRAVO stopping rule applied at
the end of the round. We have open-source software libraries implementing most

  We show that ATHENA halves the number of ballots required, for all state

stopping probability, when compared to BRAVO (stopping rule applied at the end

probability claims and our claims for the risk accrued in the first round.
Further, ATHENA reduces the number of ballots by more than a quarter for low
margins, when compared to the BRAVO stopping rule applied on ballots in
selection order. This implies that keeping track of the order when drawing
ballots R2 is not beneficial, because ATHENA is more efficient even without
information on selection order. These results are significant because current
approaches to real ballot polling election audits use the B2 BRAVO rules,
requiring about twice as much work on the part of election officials. Applying
the rules in selection order requires fewer ballots, but keeping track of the

model into b blocks of equal sizes and choose a permutation function h for
these blocks. In each block, we randomly designate a number proportional to q
of stubs as type 1 stubs, where q is a parameter in the range [0; 1]. Other
stubs are designated as type 2 stubs. To construct a network, randomly select
an unconnected stub. Suppose that this stub is in block i. If it is a type 1
stub, connect this stub to a randomly selected unconnected type 1 stub in block
h(i). If it is a type 2 stub, connect it to a randomly selected unconnected
type 2 stub. We repeat this process until all stubs are connected. Under an
assumption, we derive a closed form for the joint degree distribution of two
random neighboring vertices in the constructed graph. Based on this joint
degree distribution, we show that the Pearson degree correlation function is
linear in q for any fixed b. By properly choosing h, we show that our
construction algorithm can create assortative networks as well as
disassortative networks. We present a percolation analysis of this model. We

cavity in the dimer, plasmon induced transparency (PIT) is possible when the
cavity and the stub have the same resonance frequency. However, it is shown
that the hybridized modes in the dimer collectively generate two dark states
which make the stub-dimer ""invisible"" to the straight waveguide, splitting the
original PIT peak into two in the transmission spectrum. Simultaneously, the
original PIT peak becomes a dip due to dark state interaction, yielding
anti-PIT-like modulation of the transmission. With full-wave electromagnetic

69,Progress on Partial Edge Drawings,"Recently, a new way of avoiding crossings in straight-line drawings of
non-planar graphs has been investigated. The idea of partial edge drawings
(PED) is to drop the middle part of edges and rely on the remaining edge parts
called stubs. We focus on a symmetric model (SPED) that requires the two stubs
of an edge to be of equal length. In this way, the stub at the other endpoint
of an edge assures the viewer of the edge's existence. We also consider an
additional homogeneity constraint that forces the stub lengths to be a given
fraction $\delta$ of the edge lengths ($\delta$-SHPED). Given length and
direction of a stub, this model helps to infer the position of the opposite
stub.
  We show that, for a fixed stub--edge length ratio $\delta$, not all graphs
have a $\delta$-SHPED. Specifically, we show that $K_{241}$ does not have a
1/4-SHPED, while bandwidth-$k$ graphs always have a $\Theta(1/\sqrt{k})$-SHPED.
We also give bounds for complete bipartite graphs. Further, we consider the

stub length that a given straight-line drawing contains. We present an

slowing down the plasma waves in a controllable manner in a wide range. Our

maps of 2D and 3D double-stub resonators versus stub lengths, and we specify

73,$k$-Cut: A Simple Approximately-Uniform Method for Sampling Ballots in Post-Election Audits,"We present an approximate sampling framework and discuss how risk-limiting
audits can compensate for these approximations, while maintaining their
""risk-limiting"" properties. Our framework is general and can compensate for
counting mistakes made during audits.
  Moreover, we present and analyze a simple approximate sampling
method,""$k$-cut"", for picking a ballot randomly from a stack, without counting.
Our method involves doing $k$ ""cuts"", each involving moving a random portion of
ballots from the top to the bottom of the stack, and then picking the ballot on
top. Unlike conventional methods of picking a ballot at random, $k$-cut does
not require identification numbers on the ballots or counting many ballots per
draw. We analyze how close the distribution of chosen ballots is to the uniform
distribution, and design different mitigation procedures. We show that $k=6$

it does not require a ballot manifest; (2) it can be conducted independently at
different locations, rather than requiring a central authority to select the
sample from the whole population of cast ballots or requiring stratified
sampling; (3) it can start in polling places on election night, before margins
are known. If the reported margins for the 2016 U.S. Presidential election are
correct, a Bernoulli ballot-polling audit with a risk limit of 5% and a
sampling rate of $p_0 = 1\%$ would have had at least a 99% probability of
confirming the outcome in 42 states. (The other states were more likely to have
needed to examine additional ballots.) Logistical and security advantages that
auditing in the polling place affords may outweigh the cost of examining more
ballots than some other methods might require.",1812.06361v1,stat.AP,2018-12-15 21:57:23+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Kellie Ottoboni'), arxiv.Result.Author('Matthew Bernhard'), arxiv.Result.Author('J.

histories, and perfect matchings. We also introduce two operations on labeled
trees for symmetric Dyck tilings: symmetric Dyck tiling strip (symDTS) and
symmetric Dyck tiling ribbon (symDTR). We give two definitions of Hermite
histories for symmetric Dyck tilings, and show that they are equivalent by use
of the correspondence between symDTS operation and an Hermite history. Since
ballot tilings form a subset in the set of symmetric Dyck tilings, we construct
an inclusive map from labeled trees for ballot tilings to labeled trees for
symmetric Dyck tilings. By this inclusive map, the results for symmetric Dyck
tilings can be applied to those of ballot tilings. We introduce and study the
notions of ballot tableaux and tree-like tableaux of shifted shapes, which are
generalizations of Dyck tableaux and tree-like tableaux, respectively. The

76,SOBA: Secrecy-preserving Observable Ballot-level Audit,"SOBA is an approach to election verification that provides observers with
justifiably high confidence that the reported results of an election are
consistent with an audit trail (""ballots""), which can be paper or electronic.
SOBA combines three ideas: (1) publishing cast vote records (CVRs) separately
for each contest, so that anyone can verify that each reported contest outcome
is correct, if the CVRs reflect voters' intentions with sufficient accuracy;
(2) shrouding a mapping between ballots and the CVRs for those ballots to
prevent the loss of privacy that could occur otherwise; (3) assessing the
accuracy with which the CVRs reflect voters' intentions for a collection of
contests while simultaneously assessing the integrity of the shrouded mapping
between ballots and CVRs by comparing randomly selected ballots to the CVRs
that purport to represent them. Step (1) is related to work by the Humboldt
County Election Transparency Project, but publishing CVRs separately for
individual contests rather than images of entire ballots preserves privacy.
Step (2) requires a cryptographic commitment from elections officials.
Observers participate in step (3), which relies on the ""super-simple
simultaneous single-ballot risk-limiting audit."" Step (3) is designed to reveal
relatively few ballots if the shrouded mapping is proper and the CVRs
accurately reflect voter intent. But if the reported outcomes of the contests
differ from the outcomes that a full hand count would show, step (3) is
guaranteed to have a large chance of requiring all the ballots to be counted by
hand, thereby limiting the risk that an incorrect outcome will become official

77,"Voter Verification of BMD Ballots Is a Two-Part Question: Can They? Mostly, They Can. Do They? Mostly, They Don't","The question of whether or not voters actually verify ballots produced by
ballot marking devices (BMDs) is presently the subject of some controversy.
Recent studies (e.g., Bernhard, et al. 2020) suggest the verification rate is
low. What is not clear from previous research is whether this is more a result
of voters being unable to do so accurately or whether this is because voters
simply choose not to attempt verification in the first place. In order to
understand this problem, we conducted an experiment in which 108 participants
participated in a mock election where the BMD displayed the voters' true
choices, but then changed a subset of those choices on the printed ballot. The
design of the printed ballot, the length of the ballot, the number of changes
that were made to the ballot, the location of those changes, and the
instructions provided to the voters were manipulated as part of the experiment.
Results indicated that of those voters who chose to examine the printed ballot,
76% detected anomalies, indicating that voters can reliably detect errors on
their ballot if they will simply review it. This suggests that administrative
remedies, rather than attempts to alter fundamental human perceptual
capabilities, could be employed to encourage voters to check their ballots,
which could prove as an effective countermeasure.",2003.04997v1,cs.HC,2020-03-10 21:06:42+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Philip Kortum'), arxiv.Result.Author('Michael D. Byrne'), arxiv.Result.Author('Julie Whitmore')]",

independent polarizations: out-of-plane and in-plane modes. The band structure
and transmission spectrum is studied for diverse geometries using a simple and
efficient version of the transfer-matrix method. For the same material between
the waveguide and symmetric stubs the width of some gaps can change, upon
varying the stub length or width, by more than one order of magnitude. A
further modulation can be achieved for different material between the stubs and
the main waveguide or if the stubs are asymmetric. The gaps in the band
structure of an infinitely long system correspond to those in the transmission
spectrum of the same system but with finite number n of units. For n finite i)
there exist pseudogaps that gradually turn into complete gaps with increasing

80,Ballot stuffing and participation privacy in pollsite voting,"We study the problem of simultaneously addressing both ballot stuffing and
participation privacy for pollsite voting systems. Ballot stuffing is the
attack where fake ballots (not cast by any eligible voter) are inserted into
the system. Participation privacy is about hiding which eligible voters have
actually cast their vote. So far, the combination of ballot stuffing and
participation privacy has been mostly studied for internet voting, where voters
are assumed to own trusted computing devices. Such approaches are inapplicable
to pollsite voting where voters typically vote bare handed. We present an
eligibility audit protocol to detect ballot stuffing in pollsite voting
protocols. This is done while protecting participation privacy from a remote
observer - one who does not physically observe voters during voting. Our
protocol can be instantiated as an additional layer on top of most existing
pollsite E2E-V voting protocols. To achieve our guarantees, we develop an
efficient zero-knowledge proof (ZKP), that, given a value $v$ and a set $\Phi$
of commitments, proves $v$ is committed by some commitment in $\Phi$, without
revealing which one. We call this a ZKP of reverse set membership because of
its relationship to the popular ZKPs of set membership. This ZKP may be of
independent interest.",2210.14833v1,cs.CR,2022-10-26 16:29:23+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Prashant Agrawal'), arxiv.Result.Author('Abhinav Nakarmi'), arxiv.Result.Author('Mahabir Prasad Jhanwar'), arxiv.Result.Author('Subodh Sharma'), arxiv.Result.Author('Subhashis Banerjee')]",
81,Election forensic analysis of the Turkish Constitutional Referendum 2017,"With a majority of 'Yes' votes in the Constitutional Referendum of 2017,
Turkey continues its transition from democracy to autocracy. By the will of the
Turkish people, this referendum transferred practically all executive power to
president Erdogan. However, the referendum was confronted with a substantial
number of allegations of electoral misconducts and irregularities, ranging from
state coercion of 'No' supporters to the controversial validity of unstamped
ballots. In this note we report the results of an election forensic analysis of
the 2017 referendum to clarify to what extent these voting irregularities were
present and if they were able to influence the outcome of the referendum. We
specifically apply novel statistical forensics tests to further identify the
specific nature of electoral malpractices. In particular, we test whether the
data contains fingerprints for ballot-stuffing (submission of multiple ballots
per person during the vote) and voter rigging (coercion and intimidation of
voters). Additionally, we perform tests to identify numerical anomalies in the
election results. We find systematic and highly significant support for the
presence of both, ballot-stuffing and voter rigging. In 6% of stations we find
signs for ballot-stuffing with an error (probability of ballot-stuffing not
happening) of 0.15% (3 sigma event). The influence of these vote distortions
were large enough to tip the overall balance from 'No' to a majority of 'Yes'

82,Testing for voter rigging in small polling stations,"Since the 1970s there has been a large number of countries that combine
formal democratic institutions with authoritarian practices. Although in such
countries the ruling elites may receive considerable voter support they often
employ several manipulation tools to control election outcomes. A common
practice of these regimes is the coercion and mobilization of a significant
amount of voters to guarantee the electoral victory. This electoral
irregularity is known as voter rigging, distinguishing it from vote rigging,
which involves ballot stuffing or stealing. Here we develop a statistical test
to quantify to which extent the results of a particular election display traces
of voter rigging. Our key hypothesis is that small polling stations are more
susceptible to voter rigging, because it is easier to identify opposing
individuals, there are less eye witnesses, and supposedly less visits from
election observers. We devise a general statistical method for testing whether
voting behavior in small polling stations is significantly different from the
behavior of their neighbor stations in a way that is consistent with the
widespread occurrence of voter rigging. Based on a comparative analysis, the
method enables to rule out whether observed differences in voting behavior
might be explained by geographic heterogeneities in vote preferences. We
analyze 21 elections in ten different countries and find significant anomalies
compatible with voter rigging in Russia from 2007-2011, in Venezuela from
2006-2013, and in Uganda 2011. Particularly disturbing is the case of Venezuela
where these distortions have been outcome-determinative in the 2013

elections, that each citizen's vote should count equal. National elections can
be regarded as large-scale social experiments, where people are grouped into
usually large numbers of electoral districts and vote according to their
preferences. The large number of samples implies certain statistical
consequences for the polling results which can be used to identify election
irregularities. Using a suitable data collapse, we find that vote distributions
of elections with alleged fraud show a kurtosis of hundred times more than
normal elections on certain levels of data aggregation. As an example we show
that reported irregularities in recent Russian elections are indeed well
explained by systematic ballot stuffing and develop a parametric model
quantifying to which extent fraudulent mechanisms are present. We show that if
specific statistical properties are present in an election, the results do not
represent the will of the people. We formulate a parametric test detecting
these statistical properties in election results. Remarkably, this technique
produces similar outcomes irrespective of the data resolution and thus allows
for cross-country comparisons.",1201.3087v4,physics.soc-ph,2012-01-15 12:48:16+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Peter Klimek'), arxiv.Result.Author('Yuri Yegorov'), arxiv.Result.Author('Rudolf Hanel'), arxiv.Result.Author('Stefan Thurner')]","Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences USA 109,

84,A non-biased trust model for wireless mesh networks,"Trust models that rely on recommendation trusts are vulnerable to badmouthing
and ballot-stuffing attacks. To cope with these attacks, existing trust models
use different trust aggregation techniques to process the recommendation trusts
and combine them with the direct trust values to form a combined trust value.
However, these trust models are biased as recommendation trusts that deviate
too much from one's own opinion are discarded. In this paper, we propose a
non-biased trust model that considers every recommendation trusts available
regardless they are good or bad. Our trust model is based on a combination of 2
techniques: the dissimilarity test and the Dempster-Shafer Theory. The
dissimilarity test determines the amount of conflict between 2 trust records,
whereas the Dempster-Shafer Theory assigns belief functions based on the
results of the dissimilarity test. Numerical results show that our trust model
is robust against reputation-based attacks when compared to trust aggregation
techniques such as the linear opinion pooling, subjective logic model,
entropy-based probability model, and regression analysis. In addition, our
model has been extensively tested using network simulator NS-3 in an
Infrastructure-based wireless mesh networks and a Hybrid-based wireless mesh

85,Limiting Risk by Turning Manifest Phantoms into Evil Zombies,"Drawing a random sample of ballots to conduct a risk-limiting audit generally
requires knowing how the ballots cast in an election are organized into groups,
for instance, how many containers of ballots there are in all and how many
ballots are in each container. A list of the ballot group identifiers along
with number of ballots in each group is called a ballot manifest. What if the
ballot manifest is not accurate? Surprisingly, even if ballots are known to be
missing from the manifest, it is not necessary to make worst-case assumptions
about those ballots--for instance, to adjust the margin by the number of
missing ballots--to ensure that the audit remains conservative. Rather, it
suffices to make worst-case assumptions about the individual randomly selected
ballots that the audit cannot find. This observation provides a simple
modification to some risk-limiting audit procedures that makes them
automatically become more conservative if the ballot manifest has errors. The
modification--phantoms to evil zombies (~2EZ)--requires only an upper bound on
the total number of ballots cast. ~2EZ makes the audit P-value stochastically
larger than it would be had the manifest been accurate, automatically requiring
more than enough ballots to be audited to offset the manifest errors. This
ensures that the true risk limit remains smaller than the nominal risk limit.
On the other hand, if the manifest is in fact accurate and the upper bound on
the total number of ballots equals the total according to the manifest, ~2EZ
has no effect at all on the number of ballots audited nor on the true risk
limit.",1207.3413v1,stat.AP,2012-07-14 11:26:02+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Jorge H. Banuelos'), arxiv.Result.Author('Philip B. Stark')]",

changes from the slate they used to vote. Overall accuracy was exceptionally
high. Participants saw 1440 total contests, and of those 1440, there were a
total of 4 errors, so total accuracy was 99.8%. Participants were able to
perform with near-perfect accuracy regardless of ballot length, ballot type,
number of altered races, and location of altered races. Detection performance
was extremely robust. We conclude that with proper direction and resources,
voters can be near-perfect detectors of ballot changes on printed paper ballots

willingness to sell on the part of the citizens holding such ballots. By
contrast, decoy voters are trapped into selling their ballots at a low, or even
negligible, price. Blowing up the adversary's budget by introducing decoy

for use when single ballots are drawn at random and a decision regarding
whether to stop the audit or draw another ballot is taken after each ballot
draw (ballot-by-ballot (B2) audits). On the other hand, real ballot polling
audits draw many ballots in a single round before determining whether to stop
(round-by-round (R2) audits). We show that BRAVO results in significant
inefficiency when directly applied to real R2 audits. We present the ATHENA
class of R2 stopping rules, which we show are risk-limiting if the round
schedule is pre-determined (before the audit begins). We prove that each rule
is at least as efficient as the corresponding BRAVO stopping rule applied at
the end of the round. We have open-source software libraries implementing most
of our results.
  We show that ATHENA halves the number of ballots required, for all state
margins in the 2016 US Presidential election and a first round with $90\%$
stopping probability, when compared to BRAVO (stopping rule applied at the end
of the round). We present simulation results supporting the 90% stopping
probability claims and our claims for the risk accrued in the first round.
Further, ATHENA reduces the number of ballots by more than a quarter for low
margins, when compared to the BRAVO stopping rule applied on ballots in
selection order. This implies that keeping track of the order when drawing
ballots R2 is not beneficial, because ATHENA is more efficient even without
information on selection order. These results are significant because current
approaches to real ballot polling election audits use the B2 BRAVO rules,
requiring about twice as much work on the part of election officials. Applying
the rules in selection order requires fewer ballots, but keeping track of the
order, and entering it into audit software, adds to the effort.",2008.02315v5,cs.CR,2020-08-05 18:47:37+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Filip Zagórski'), arxiv.Result.Author('Grant McClearn'), arxiv.Result.Author('Sarah Morin'), arxiv.Result.Author('Neal McBurnett'), arxiv.Result.Author('Poorvi L.

96,SOBA: Secrecy-preserving Observable Ballot-level Audit,"SOBA is an approach to election verification that provides observers with
justifiably high confidence that the reported results of an election are
consistent with an audit trail (""ballots""), which can be paper or electronic.
SOBA combines three ideas: (1) publishing cast vote records (CVRs) separately
for each contest, so that anyone can verify that each reported contest outcome
is correct, if the CVRs reflect voters' intentions with sufficient accuracy;
(2) shrouding a mapping between ballots and the CVRs for those ballots to
prevent the loss of privacy that could occur otherwise; (3) assessing the
accuracy with which the CVRs reflect voters' intentions for a collection of
contests while simultaneously assessing the integrity of the shrouded mapping
between ballots and CVRs by comparing randomly selected ballots to the CVRs
that purport to represent them. Step (1) is related to work by the Humboldt
County Election Transparency Project, but publishing CVRs separately for
individual contests rather than images of entire ballots preserves privacy.
Step (2) requires a cryptographic commitment from elections officials.
Observers participate in step (3), which relies on the ""super-simple
simultaneous single-ballot risk-limiting audit."" Step (3) is designed to reveal
relatively few ballots if the shrouded mapping is proper and the CVRs
accurately reflect voter intent. But if the reported outcomes of the contests
differ from the outcomes that a full hand count would show, step (3) is
guaranteed to have a large chance of requiring all the ballots to be counted by
hand, thereby limiting the risk that an incorrect outcome will become official
and final.",1105.5803v2,stat.AP,2011-05-29 17:00:20+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Josh Benaloh'), arxiv.Result.Author('Douglas Jones'), arxiv.Result.Author('Eric Lazarus'), arxiv.Result.Author('Mark Lindeman'), arxiv.Result.Author('Philip B. Stark')]",
97,"Voter Verification of BMD Ballots Is a Two-Part Question: Can They? Mostly, They Can. Do They? Mostly, They Don't","The question of whether or not voters actually verify ballots produced by
ballot marking devices (BMDs) is presently the subject of some controversy.
Recent studies (e.g., Bernhard, et al. 2020) suggest the verification rate is
low. What is not clear from previous research is whether this is more a result
of voters being unable to do so accurately or whether this is because voters
simply choose not to attempt verification in the first place. In order to
understand this problem, we conducted an experiment in which 108 participants
participated in a mock election where the BMD displayed the voters' true
choices, but then changed a subset of those choices on the printed ballot. The
design of the printed ballot, the length of the ballot, the number of changes
that were made to the ballot, the location of those changes, and the
instructions provided to the voters were manipulated as part of the experiment.
Results indicated that of those voters who chose to examine the printed ballot,
76% detected anomalies, indicating that voters can reliably detect errors on
their ballot if they will simply review it. This suggests that administrative
remedies, rather than attempts to alter fundamental human perceptual
capabilities, could be employed to encourage voters to check their ballots,

100,"More style, less work: card-style data decrease risk-limiting audit sample sizes","U.S. elections rely heavily on computers such as voter registration
databases, electronic pollbooks, voting machines, scanners, tabulators, and
results reporting websites. These introduce digital threats to election
outcomes. Risk-limiting audits (RLAs) mitigate threats to some of these systems
by manually inspecting random samples of ballot cards. RLAs have a large chance
of correcting wrong outcomes (by conducting a full manual tabulation of a
trustworthy record of the votes), but can save labor when reported outcomes are
correct. This efficiency is eroded when sampling cannot be targeted to ballot
cards that contain the contest(s) under audit. If the sample is drawn from all
cast cards, RLA sample sizes scale like the reciprocal of the fraction of
ballot cards that contain the contest(s) under audit. That fraction shrinks as
the number of cards per ballot grows (i.e., when elections contain more
contests) and as the fraction of ballots that contain the contest decreases
(i.e., when a smaller percentage of voters are eligible to vote in the
contest). States that conduct RLAs of contests on multi-card ballots or of
small contests can dramatically reduce sample sizes by using information about
which ballot cards contain which contests -- by keeping track of card-style
data (CSD). For instance, CSD reduces the expected number of draws needed to
audit a single countywide contest on a 4-card ballot by 75%. Similarly, CSD
reduces the expected number of draws by 95% or more for an audit of two
contests with the same margin on a 4-card ballot if one contest is on every
ballot and the other is on 10% of ballots. In realistic examples, the savings
can be several orders of magnitude.",2012.03371v1,cs.CR,2020-12-06 20:35:12+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Amanda K. Glazer'), arxiv.Result.Author('Jacob V. Spertus'), arxiv.Result.Author('Philip B. Stark')]",
101,Sets of Half-Average Nulls Generate Risk-Limiting Audits: SHANGRLA,"Risk-limiting audits (RLAs) for many social choice functions can be reduced
to testing sets of null hypotheses of the form ""the average of this list is not
greater than 1/2"" for a collection of finite lists of nonnegative numbers. Such
social choice functions include majority, super-majority, plurality,
multi-winner plurality, Instant Runoff Voting (IRV), Borda count, approval
voting, and STAR-Voting, among others. The audit stops without a full hand
count iff all the null hypotheses are rejected. The nulls can be tested in many
ways. Ballot-polling is particularly simple; two new ballot-polling
risk-measuring functions for sampling without replacement are given.
Ballot-level comparison audits transform each null into an equivalent assertion
that the mean of re-scaled tabulation errors is not greater than 1/2. In turn,
that null can then be tested using the same statistical methods used for ballot
polling---but applied to different finite lists of nonnegative numbers.
SHANGRLA comparison audits are more efficient than previous comparison audits
for two reasons: (i) for most social choice functions, the conditions tested
are both necessary and sufficient for the reported outcome to be correct, while
previous methods tested conditions that were sufficient but not necessary, and
(ii) the tests avoid a conservative approximation. The SHANGRLA abstraction
simplifies stratified audits, including audits that combine ballot polling with
ballot-level comparisons, producing sharper audits than the ""SUITE"" approach.
SHANGRLA works with the ""phantoms to evil zombies"" strategy to treat missing
ballot cards and missing or redacted cast vote records. That also facilitates
sampling from ""ballot-style manifests,"" which can dramatically improve
efficiency when the audited contests do not appear on every ballot card.

102,Limiting Risk by Turning Manifest Phantoms into Evil Zombies,"Drawing a random sample of ballots to conduct a risk-limiting audit generally
requires knowing how the ballots cast in an election are organized into groups,
for instance, how many containers of ballots there are in all and how many
ballots are in each container. A list of the ballot group identifiers along
with number of ballots in each group is called a ballot manifest. What if the
ballot manifest is not accurate? Surprisingly, even if ballots are known to be
missing from the manifest, it is not necessary to make worst-case assumptions
about those ballots--for instance, to adjust the margin by the number of
missing ballots--to ensure that the audit remains conservative. Rather, it
suffices to make worst-case assumptions about the individual randomly selected
ballots that the audit cannot find. This observation provides a simple
modification to some risk-limiting audit procedures that makes them
automatically become more conservative if the ballot manifest has errors. The
modification--phantoms to evil zombies (~2EZ)--requires only an upper bound on
the total number of ballots cast. ~2EZ makes the audit P-value stochastically
larger than it would be had the manifest been accurate, automatically requiring
more than enough ballots to be audited to offset the manifest errors. This
ensures that the true risk limit remains smaller than the nominal risk limit.
On the other hand, if the manifest is in fact accurate and the upper bound on
the total number of ballots equals the total according to the manifest, ~2EZ
has no effect at all on the number of ballots audited nor on the true risk
limit.",1207.3413v1,stat.AP,2012-07-14 11:26:02+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Jorge H. Banuelos'), arxiv.Result.Author('Philip B. Stark')]",

expected that random errors should have nearly equal effects on all candidates,
and thus be fair. We find to the contrary that random errors can introduce
systematic bias into election results. This is because, even if the errors are
random, votes for different candidates occur in different patterns that are
affected differently by random errors. In the STV context, the most important
effect of random errors is to invalidate the ballot. This removes far more
votes for those candidates whose supporters tend to list a lot of preferences,
because their ballots are much more likely to be invalidated by random error.
Different validity rules for different voting styles mean that errors are much
more likely to penalise some types of votes than others. For close elections
this systematic bias can change the result of the election.",2007.00854v3,cs.CY,2020-07-02 03:37:48+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Michelle Blom'), arxiv.Result.Author('Andrew Conway'), arxiv.Result.Author('Peter J.

auditors input known test votes into the BMD and check the printout. Passive
testing monitors the rate of ""spoiled"" BMD printout, on the theory that if BMDs
malfunction, the rate will increase noticeably. We show that these approaches
cannot reliably detect outcome-altering problems, because: (i) The number of
possible interactions with BMDs is enormous, so testing interactions uniformly
at random is hopeless. (ii) To probe the space of interactions intelligently
requires an accurate model of voter behavior, but because the space of
interactions is so large, building an accurate model requires observing a huge
number of voters in every jurisdiction in every election--more voters than
there are in most jurisdictions. (iii) Even with a perfect model of voter
behavior, the number of tests needed exceeds the number of voters in most
jurisdictions. (iv) An attacker can target interactions that are expensive to
test, e.g., because they involve voting slowly; or interactions for which
tampering is less likely to be noticed, e.g., because the voter uses the audio
interface. (v) Whether BMDs misbehave or not, the distribution of spoiled
ballots is unknown and varies by election and possibly by ballot style:
historical data do not help much. Hence, there is no way to calibrate a
threshold for passive testing, e.g., to guarantee at least a 95% chance of
noticing that 5% of the votes were altered, with at most a 5% false alarm rate.

perform with near-perfect accuracy regardless of ballot length, ballot type,
number of altered races, and location of altered races. Detection performance
was extremely robust. We conclude that with proper direction and resources,

even the most carefully designed systems necessarily leak information via the

possibility of candidates getting no or few votes could have implications for
security in practice: if a coercer demands that a voter cast a vote for such an
unpopular candidate, then the voter may feel obliged to obey, even if she is
confident that the voting system satisfies the standard coercion resistance
definitions. With complex ballots, there may also be a danger of ""Italian""
style (aka ""signature"") attacks: the coercer demands the voter cast a ballot
with a specific, identifying pattern. Here we propose an approach to tallying
end-to-end verifiable schemes that avoids revealing all the votes but still
achieves whatever confidence level in the announced result is desired. Now a
coerced voter can claim that the required vote must be amongst those that
remained shrouded. Our approach is based on the well-established notion of
Risk-Limiting Audits, but here applied to the tally rather than to the audit.
We show that this approach counters coercion threats arising in extreme tallies

real ballots of any strict subset of districts at a price corresponding to the
willingness to sell on the part of the citizens holding such ballots. By
contrast, decoy voters are trapped into selling their ballots at a low, or even
negligible, price. Blowing up the adversary's budget by introducing decoy

112,The ATHENA Class of Risk-Limiting Ballot Polling Audits,"The main risk-limiting ballot polling audit in use today, BRAVO, is designed
for use when single ballots are drawn at random and a decision regarding
whether to stop the audit or draw another ballot is taken after each ballot
draw (ballot-by-ballot (B2) audits). On the other hand, real ballot polling
audits draw many ballots in a single round before determining whether to stop
(round-by-round (R2) audits). We show that BRAVO results in significant
inefficiency when directly applied to real R2 audits. We present the ATHENA
class of R2 stopping rules, which we show are risk-limiting if the round
schedule is pre-determined (before the audit begins). We prove that each rule
is at least as efficient as the corresponding BRAVO stopping rule applied at
the end of the round. We have open-source software libraries implementing most
of our results.
  We show that ATHENA halves the number of ballots required, for all state
margins in the 2016 US Presidential election and a first round with $90\%$
stopping probability, when compared to BRAVO (stopping rule applied at the end
of the round). We present simulation results supporting the 90% stopping
probability claims and our claims for the risk accrued in the first round.
Further, ATHENA reduces the number of ballots by more than a quarter for low
margins, when compared to the BRAVO stopping rule applied on ballots in
selection order. This implies that keeping track of the order when drawing
ballots R2 is not beneficial, because ATHENA is more efficient even without
information on selection order. These results are significant because current
approaches to real ballot polling election audits use the B2 BRAVO rules,
requiring about twice as much work on the part of election officials. Applying
the rules in selection order requires fewer ballots, but keeping track of the
order, and entering it into audit software, adds to the effort.",2008.02315v5,cs.CR,2020-08-05 18:47:37+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Filip Zagórski'), arxiv.Result.Author('Grant McClearn'), arxiv.Result.Author('Sarah Morin'), arxiv.Result.Author('Neal McBurnett'), arxiv.Result.Author('Poorvi L.

124,Limiting Risk by Turning Manifest Phantoms into Evil Zombies,"Drawing a random sample of ballots to conduct a risk-limiting audit generally
requires knowing how the ballots cast in an election are organized into groups,
for instance, how many containers of ballots there are in all and how many
ballots are in each container. A list of the ballot group identifiers along
with number of ballots in each group is called a ballot manifest. What if the
ballot manifest is not accurate? Surprisingly, even if ballots are known to be
missing from the manifest, it is not necessary to make worst-case assumptions
about those ballots--for instance, to adjust the margin by the number of
missing ballots--to ensure that the audit remains conservative. Rather, it
suffices to make worst-case assumptions about the individual randomly selected
ballots that the audit cannot find. This observation provides a simple
modification to some risk-limiting audit procedures that makes them
automatically become more conservative if the ballot manifest has errors. The
modification--phantoms to evil zombies (~2EZ)--requires only an upper bound on
the total number of ballots cast. ~2EZ makes the audit P-value stochastically
larger than it would be had the manifest been accurate, automatically requiring
more than enough ballots to be audited to offset the manifest errors. This
ensures that the true risk limit remains smaller than the nominal risk limit.
On the other hand, if the manifest is in fact accurate and the upper bound on
the total number of ballots equals the total according to the manifest, ~2EZ
has no effect at all on the number of ballots audited nor on the true risk
limit.",1207.3413v1,stat.AP,2012-07-14 11:26:02+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Jorge H. Banuelos'), arxiv.Result.Author('Philip B. Stark')]",

permutations avoiding $132$ and $312$ with left factors of Dyck paths. In

In this study, we altered votes on a voter's ballot after they had made their
selections on a BMD. We then required them to examine their ballots for any
changes from the slate they used to vote. Overall accuracy was exceptionally
high. Participants saw 1440 total contests, and of those 1440, there were a
total of 4 errors, so total accuracy was 99.8%. Participants were able to
perform with near-perfect accuracy regardless of ballot length, ballot type,
number of altered races, and location of altered races. Detection performance
was extremely robust. We conclude that with proper direction and resources,
voters can be near-perfect detectors of ballot changes on printed paper ballots
after voting with a BMD. This finding has significant implications for the
voting community as BMD use continues to grow. Research should now focus on
identifying administrative and behavioral methods that will prompt and
encourage voters to check their BMD-generated ballots before they drop them in

spectrum of rapidly rotating stars is a superposition of frequency subsets
associated with dynamically independent regions of the ray-dynamics phase
space. At high rotation rates corresponding to typical $\delta$ Scuti stars,
two frequency subsets are expected to be visible : a regular frequency subset
described by a Tassoul like formula and an irregular frequency subset with
specific statistical properties. In this paper, we investigate whether the
regular patterns can be detected in the resulting spectrum. We compute the
autocorrelation function of synthetic spectra where the frequencies follow the
asymptotic theory, the relative amplitudes are simply given by the modes'
disk-averaging factors, and the frequency resolution is that of a CoRoT long
run. Our first results are that (i) the detection of regular patterns strongly
depends on the ratio of regular over irregular modes, (ii) low inclination
angle configurations are more favorable than near equator-on configurations,
(iii) in the absence of differential rotation, the $2 \Omega$ rotational
splitting between $m=1$ and $m=-1$ modes is an easy feature to detect.",1009.5939v1,astro-ph.SR,2010-09-29 16:38:09+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('F. Lignieres'), arxiv.Result.Author('B. Georgeot'), arxiv.Result.Author('J. Ballot')]",

130,The ATHENA Class of Risk-Limiting Ballot Polling Audits,"The main risk-limiting ballot polling audit in use today, BRAVO, is designed
for use when single ballots are drawn at random and a decision regarding
whether to stop the audit or draw another ballot is taken after each ballot
draw (ballot-by-ballot (B2) audits). On the other hand, real ballot polling
audits draw many ballots in a single round before determining whether to stop
(round-by-round (R2) audits). We show that BRAVO results in significant
inefficiency when directly applied to real R2 audits. We present the ATHENA
class of R2 stopping rules, which we show are risk-limiting if the round
schedule is pre-determined (before the audit begins). We prove that each rule
is at least as efficient as the corresponding BRAVO stopping rule applied at
the end of the round. We have open-source software libraries implementing most
of our results.
  We show that ATHENA halves the number of ballots required, for all state
margins in the 2016 US Presidential election and a first round with $90\%$
stopping probability, when compared to BRAVO (stopping rule applied at the end
of the round). We present simulation results supporting the 90% stopping
probability claims and our claims for the risk accrued in the first round.
Further, ATHENA reduces the number of ballots by more than a quarter for low
margins, when compared to the BRAVO stopping rule applied on ballots in
selection order. This implies that keeping track of the order when drawing
ballots R2 is not beneficial, because ATHENA is more efficient even without
information on selection order. These results are significant because current
approaches to real ballot polling election audits use the B2 BRAVO rules,
requiring about twice as much work on the part of election officials. Applying
the rules in selection order requires fewer ballots, but keeping track of the
order, and entering it into audit software, adds to the effort.",2008.02315v5,cs.CR,2020-08-05 18:47:37+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Filip Zagórski'), arxiv.Result.Author('Grant McClearn'), arxiv.Result.Author('Sarah Morin'), arxiv.Result.Author('Neal McBurnett'), arxiv.Result.Author('Poorvi L.

Our method involves doing $k$ ""cuts"", each involving moving a random portion of
ballots from the top to the bottom of the stack, and then picking the ballot on
top. Unlike conventional methods of picking a ballot at random, $k$-cut does
not require identification numbers on the ballots or counting many ballots per
draw. We analyze how close the distribution of chosen ballots is to the uniform
distribution, and design different mitigation procedures. We show that $k=6$
cuts is enough for an risk-limiting election audit, based on empirical data,

it does not require a ballot manifest; (2) it can be conducted independently at
different locations, rather than requiring a central authority to select the
sample from the whole population of cast ballots or requiring stratified
sampling; (3) it can start in polling places on election night, before margins
are known. If the reported margins for the 2016 U.S. Presidential election are
correct, a Bernoulli ballot-polling audit with a risk limit of 5% and a
sampling rate of $p_0 = 1\%$ would have had at least a 99% probability of

evidence against or in support of the recorded result. Risk-limiting audits for
first-past-the-post elections are well understood, and used in some US
elections. We define a number of approaches to ballot-polling and comparison

influence the outcome of an election, given fixed voter preferences. We show
that there exist preference profiles over $k$ candidates such that up to $k-1$
different candidates win at different ballot lengths. We derive exact lower
bounds on the number of voters required for such profiles and provide a
construction matching the lower bound for unrestricted voter preferences.
Additionally, we characterize which sequences of winners are possible over
ballot lengths and provide explicit profile constructions achieving any
feasible winner sequence. We also examine how classic preference restrictions
influence our results--for instance, single-peakedness makes $k-1$ different
winners impossible but still allows at least $\Omega(\sqrt k)$. Finally, we
analyze a collection of 168 real-world elections, where we truncate rankings to
simulate shorter ballots. We find that shorter ballots could have changed the
outcome in one quarter of these elections. Our results highlight ballot length

square, i.e $\lambda=\lambda_1\ge...\ge\lambda_k>0$, and
$\lambda_1=k,\lambda_k=1$, then applying the algorithm $\ell$ times gives rise
to a set whose cardinality is either the Catalan number $c_{\ell-k+1}$ (the
self dual case) or twice the Catalan number. The algorithm defines a tree and
we study the propagation of the tree, which is not in the isomorphism class of
the usual Catalan tree. The algorithm can also be modified to produce a
two--parameter family of sets and the resulting cardinalities of the sets are
the ballot numbers. Finally, we give a conjecture on the rank of a particular

140,Risk-Limiting Audits by Stratified Union-Intersection Tests of Elections (SUITE),"Risk-limiting audits (RLAs) offer a statistical guarantee: if a full manual
tally of the paper ballots would show that the reported election outcome is
wrong, an RLA has a known minimum chance of leading to a full manual tally.
RLAs generally rely on random samples. Stratified sampling--partitioning the
population of ballots into disjoint strata and sampling independently from the
strata--may simplify logistics or increase efficiency compared to simpler
sampling designs, but makes risk calculations harder. We present SUITE, a new
method for conducting RLAs using stratified samples. SUITE considers all
possible partitions of outcome-changing error across strata. For each
partition, it combines P-values from stratum-level tests into a combined
P-value; there is no restriction on the tests used in different strata. SUITE
maximizes the combined P-value over all partitions of outcome-changing error.
The audit can stop if that maximum is less than the risk limit. Voting systems
in some Colorado counties (comprising 98.2% of voters) allow auditors to check
how the system interpreted each ballot, which allows ballot-level comparison
RLAs. Other counties use ballot polling, which is less efficient. Extant
approaches to conducting an RLA of a statewide contest would require major
changes to Colorado's procedures and software, or would sacrifice the
efficiency of ballot-level comparison. SUITE does not. It divides ballots into
two strata: those cast in counties that can conduct ballot-level comparisons,
and the rest. Stratum-level P-values are found by methods derived here. The
resulting audit is substantially more efficient than statewide ballot polling.
SUITE is useful in any state with a mix of voting systems or that uses
stratified sampling for other reasons. We provide an open-source reference
implementation and exemplar calculations in Jupyter notebooks.",1809.04235v1,stat.AP,2018-09-12 02:56:22+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Kellie Ottoboni'), arxiv.Result.Author('Philip B. Stark'), arxiv.Result.Author('Mark Lindeman'), arxiv.Result.Author('Neal McBurnett')]",

assembled from commercial off-the-shelf software for small private elections.
The system is transparent and enables each voter to verify that the tally
includes their ballot selection without requiring any understanding of
cryptography. This paper describes the system and its use in fall 2020, to vote
remotely in promotion committees in a university. Each voter fills out a form
in the cloud with their vote V (YES, NO, ABSTAIN) and a passphrase P-two words
entered by the voter. The system generates a verification prompt of the (P,V)
pairs and a tally of the votes, organized to help visualize how the votes add
up. After the polls close, each voter verifies that this table lists their
(P,V) pair and that the tally is computed correctly. The system is especially
appropriate for any small group making sensitive decisions. Because the system
would not prevent a coercer from demanding that their victim use a specified
passphrase, it is not designed for applications where such malfeasance would be
likely or go undetected. Results from 43 voters show that the system was
well-accepted, performed effectively for its intended purpose, and introduced
users to the concept of voter-verified elections. Compared to the commonly-used
alternatives of paper ballots or voting by email, voters found the system
easier to use, and that it provided greater privacy and outcome integrity.",2103.07180v1,cs.CR,2021-03-12 09:59:55+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Enka Blanchard'), arxiv.Result.Author('Ryan Robucci'), arxiv.Result.Author('Ted Selker'), arxiv.Result.Author('Alan Sherman')]",

144,BVOT: Self-Tallying Boardroom Voting with Oblivious Transfer,"A boardroom election is an election with a small number of voters carried out
with public communications. We present BVOT, a self-tallying boardroom voting
protocol with ballot secrecy, fairness (no tally information is available
before the polls close), and dispute-freeness (voters can observe that all
voters correctly followed the protocol).
  BVOT works by using a multiparty threshold homomorphic encryption system in
which each candidate is associated with a masked unique prime. Each voter
engages in an oblivious transfer with an untrusted distributor: the voter
selects the index of a prime associated with a candidate and receives the
selected prime in masked form. The voter then casts their vote by encrypting
their masked prime and broadcasting it to everyone. The distributor does not
learn the voter's choice, and no one learns the mapping between primes and
candidates until the audit phase. By hiding the mapping between primes and
candidates, BVOT provides voters with insufficient information to carry out
effective cheating. The threshold feature prevents anyone from computing any
partial tally---until everyone has voted. Multiplying all votes, their
decryption shares, and the unmasking factor yields a product of the primes each
raised to the number of votes received.
  In contrast to some existing boardroom voting protocols, BVOT does not rely
on any zero-knowledge proof; instead, it uses oblivious transfer to assure
ballot secrecy and correct vote casting. Also, BVOT can handle multiple
candidates in one election. BVOT prevents cheating by hiding crucial
information: an attempt to increase the tally of one candidate might increase
the tally of another candidate. After all votes are cast, any party can tally
the votes.",2010.02421v1,cs.CR,2020-10-06 01:28:34+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Farid Javani'), arxiv.Result.Author('Alan T. Sherman')]",

Ballot-polling audits select ballots at random and interpret those ballots as
evidence for and against the reported result, continuing this process until
either they support the recorded result, or they fall back to a full manual
recount. For elections with digitised scanning and counting of ballots, a
comparison audit compares randomly selected digital ballots with their paper
versions. Discrepancies are referred to as errors, and are used to build
evidence against or in support of the recorded result. Risk-limiting audits for
first-past-the-post elections are well understood, and used in some US
elections. We define a number of approaches to ballot-polling and comparison
risk-limiting audits for Instant Runoff Voting (IRV) elections. We show that

147,Identifying Possible Winners in Ranked Choice Voting Elections with Outstanding Ballots,"Several election districts in the US have recently moved to ranked-choice
voting (RCV) to decide the results of local elections. RCV allows voters to
rank their choices, and the results are computed in rounds, eliminating one
candidate at a time. RCV ensures fairer elections and has been shown to
increase elected representation of women and people of color. A main drawback
of RCV is that the round-by-round process requires all the ballots to be
tallied before the results of an election can be calculated. With increasingly
large portions of ballots coming from absentee voters, RCV election outcomes
are not always apparent on election night, and can take several weeks to be
published, leading to a loss of trust in the electoral process from the public.
In this paper, we present an algorithm for efficiently computing possible
winners of RCV elections from partially known ballots and evaluate it on data
from the recent New York City Primary elections. We show that our techniques
allow to significantly narrow down the field of possible election winners, and
in some case identify the winner as soon as election night despite a number of

process.",2206.12741v1,cs.CY,2022-06-25 22:08:15+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Alborz Jelvani'), arxiv.Result.Author('Amélie Marian')]",

extensive attention from academia and industry in recent years. Most of the

server is mandatory. However, centralized frameworks suffer from the issues of
unscalability and single-point-of-failure. Consequently, decentralized IoT has
been proposed by taking advantage of the emerging technology of Blockchain.
Voting systems are widely adopted in IoT, such as a leader election in wireless
sensor networks. Self-tallying voting systems are alternatives to traditional
centralized voting systems in decentralized IoT since the traditional ones are
not suitable for such scenarios. Unfortunately, self-tallying voting systems
inherently suffer from fairness issues, such as adaptive and abortive issues
caused by malicious voters. In this paper, we introduce a framework of
self-tallying systems in decentralized IoT based on Blockchain. We propose a
concrete construction and prove the proposed system satisfies all the security

149,Risk-Limiting Tallies,"Many voter-verifiable, coercion-resistant schemes have been proposed, but
even the most carefully designed systems necessarily leak information via the
announced result. In corner cases, this may be problematic. For example, if all
the votes go to one candidate then all vote privacy evaporates. The mere
possibility of candidates getting no or few votes could have implications for
security in practice: if a coercer demands that a voter cast a vote for such an
unpopular candidate, then the voter may feel obliged to obey, even if she is
confident that the voting system satisfies the standard coercion resistance
definitions. With complex ballots, there may also be a danger of ""Italian""
style (aka ""signature"") attacks: the coercer demands the voter cast a ballot
with a specific, identifying pattern. Here we propose an approach to tallying
end-to-end verifiable schemes that avoids revealing all the votes but still
achieves whatever confidence level in the announced result is desired. Now a
coerced voter can claim that the required vote must be amongst those that
remained shrouded. Our approach is based on the well-established notion of
Risk-Limiting Audits, but here applied to the tally rather than to the audit.
We show that this approach counters coercion threats arising in extreme tallies

151,The ATHENA Class of Risk-Limiting Ballot Polling Audits,"The main risk-limiting ballot polling audit in use today, BRAVO, is designed
for use when single ballots are drawn at random and a decision regarding
whether to stop the audit or draw another ballot is taken after each ballot
draw (ballot-by-ballot (B2) audits). On the other hand, real ballot polling
audits draw many ballots in a single round before determining whether to stop
(round-by-round (R2) audits). We show that BRAVO results in significant
inefficiency when directly applied to real R2 audits. We present the ATHENA
class of R2 stopping rules, which we show are risk-limiting if the round
schedule is pre-determined (before the audit begins). We prove that each rule
is at least as efficient as the corresponding BRAVO stopping rule applied at
the end of the round. We have open-source software libraries implementing most
of our results.
  We show that ATHENA halves the number of ballots required, for all state
margins in the 2016 US Presidential election and a first round with $90\%$
stopping probability, when compared to BRAVO (stopping rule applied at the end
of the round). We present simulation results supporting the 90% stopping
probability claims and our claims for the risk accrued in the first round.
Further, ATHENA reduces the number of ballots by more than a quarter for low
margins, when compared to the BRAVO stopping rule applied on ballots in
selection order. This implies that keeping track of the order when drawing
ballots R2 is not beneficial, because ATHENA is more efficient even without
information on selection order. These results are significant because current
approaches to real ballot polling election audits use the B2 BRAVO rules,
requiring about twice as much work on the part of election officials. Applying
the rules in selection order requires fewer ballots, but keeping track of the
order, and entering it into audit software, adds to the effort.",2008.02315v5,cs.CR,2020-08-05 18:47:37+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Filip Zagórski'), arxiv.Result.Author('Grant McClearn'), arxiv.Result.Author('Sarah Morin'), arxiv.Result.Author('Neal McBurnett'), arxiv.Result.Author('Poorvi L.

sampling; (3) it can start in polling places on election night, before margins
are known. If the reported margins for the 2016 U.S. Presidential election are
correct, a Bernoulli ballot-polling audit with a risk limit of 5% and a
sampling rate of $p_0 = 1\%$ would have had at least a 99% probability of

allow the implementation of the first protocol, while reducing the interaction

authorities themselves. The simultaneous broadcast is also limited to the
authorities. As long as a single authority is honest, the privacy is
unconditional, however, a single corrupt authority or a single corrupt voter

requires knowing how the ballots cast in an election are organized into groups,
for instance, how many containers of ballots there are in all and how many
ballots are in each container. A list of the ballot group identifiers along
with number of ballots in each group is called a ballot manifest. What if the
ballot manifest is not accurate? Surprisingly, even if ballots are known to be
missing from the manifest, it is not necessary to make worst-case assumptions
about those ballots--for instance, to adjust the margin by the number of
missing ballots--to ensure that the audit remains conservative. Rather, it
suffices to make worst-case assumptions about the individual randomly selected
ballots that the audit cannot find. This observation provides a simple
modification to some risk-limiting audit procedures that makes them
automatically become more conservative if the ballot manifest has errors. The
modification--phantoms to evil zombies (~2EZ)--requires only an upper bound on
the total number of ballots cast. ~2EZ makes the audit P-value stochastically
larger than it would be had the manifest been accurate, automatically requiring
more than enough ballots to be audited to offset the manifest errors. This
ensures that the true risk limit remains smaller than the nominal risk limit.
On the other hand, if the manifest is in fact accurate and the upper bound on

was extremely robust. We conclude that with proper direction and resources,
voters can be near-perfect detectors of ballot changes on printed paper ballots

malevolent adversary trying to buy real ballots. If the citizenry is divided
into subgroups (or districts), the adversary can construct a so-called ""Devil's
Menu"" consisting of several prices. In equilibrium, the adversary can buy the
real ballots of any strict subset of districts at a price corresponding to the
willingness to sell on the part of the citizens holding such ballots. By
contrast, decoy voters are trapped into selling their ballots at a low, or even
negligible, price. Blowing up the adversary's budget by introducing decoy
ballots may thus turn out to be futile. The Devil's Menu can also be applied to

165,The ATHENA Class of Risk-Limiting Ballot Polling Audits,"The main risk-limiting ballot polling audit in use today, BRAVO, is designed
for use when single ballots are drawn at random and a decision regarding
whether to stop the audit or draw another ballot is taken after each ballot
draw (ballot-by-ballot (B2) audits). On the other hand, real ballot polling
audits draw many ballots in a single round before determining whether to stop
(round-by-round (R2) audits). We show that BRAVO results in significant
inefficiency when directly applied to real R2 audits. We present the ATHENA
class of R2 stopping rules, which we show are risk-limiting if the round
schedule is pre-determined (before the audit begins). We prove that each rule
is at least as efficient as the corresponding BRAVO stopping rule applied at
the end of the round. We have open-source software libraries implementing most
of our results.
  We show that ATHENA halves the number of ballots required, for all state
margins in the 2016 US Presidential election and a first round with $90\%$
stopping probability, when compared to BRAVO (stopping rule applied at the end
of the round). We present simulation results supporting the 90% stopping
probability claims and our claims for the risk accrued in the first round.
Further, ATHENA reduces the number of ballots by more than a quarter for low
margins, when compared to the BRAVO stopping rule applied on ballots in
selection order. This implies that keeping track of the order when drawing
ballots R2 is not beneficial, because ATHENA is more efficient even without
information on selection order. These results are significant because current
approaches to real ballot polling election audits use the B2 BRAVO rules,
requiring about twice as much work on the part of election officials. Applying
the rules in selection order requires fewer ballots, but keeping track of the
order, and entering it into audit software, adds to the effort.",2008.02315v5,cs.CR,2020-08-05 18:47:37+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Filip Zagórski'), arxiv.Result.Author('Grant McClearn'), arxiv.Result.Author('Sarah Morin'), arxiv.Result.Author('Neal McBurnett'), arxiv.Result.Author('Poorvi L.

Our method involves doing $k$ ""cuts"", each involving moving a random portion of
ballots from the top to the bottom of the stack, and then picking the ballot on
top. Unlike conventional methods of picking a ballot at random, $k$-cut does
not require identification numbers on the ballots or counting many ballots per
draw. We analyze how close the distribution of chosen ballots is to the uniform
distribution, and design different mitigation procedures. We show that $k=6$

it does not require a ballot manifest; (2) it can be conducted independently at
different locations, rather than requiring a central authority to select the
sample from the whole population of cast ballots or requiring stratified
sampling; (3) it can start in polling places on election night, before margins
are known. If the reported margins for the 2016 U.S. Presidential election are
correct, a Bernoulli ballot-polling audit with a risk limit of 5% and a
sampling rate of $p_0 = 1\%$ would have had at least a 99% probability of

ballot tilings form a subset in the set of symmetric Dyck tilings, we construct
an inclusive map from labeled trees for ballot tilings to labeled trees for

169,SOBA: Secrecy-preserving Observable Ballot-level Audit,"SOBA is an approach to election verification that provides observers with
justifiably high confidence that the reported results of an election are
consistent with an audit trail (""ballots""), which can be paper or electronic.
SOBA combines three ideas: (1) publishing cast vote records (CVRs) separately
for each contest, so that anyone can verify that each reported contest outcome
is correct, if the CVRs reflect voters' intentions with sufficient accuracy;
(2) shrouding a mapping between ballots and the CVRs for those ballots to
prevent the loss of privacy that could occur otherwise; (3) assessing the
accuracy with which the CVRs reflect voters' intentions for a collection of
contests while simultaneously assessing the integrity of the shrouded mapping
between ballots and CVRs by comparing randomly selected ballots to the CVRs
that purport to represent them. Step (1) is related to work by the Humboldt
County Election Transparency Project, but publishing CVRs separately for
individual contests rather than images of entire ballots preserves privacy.
Step (2) requires a cryptographic commitment from elections officials.
Observers participate in step (3), which relies on the ""super-simple
simultaneous single-ballot risk-limiting audit."" Step (3) is designed to reveal
relatively few ballots if the shrouded mapping is proper and the CVRs
accurately reflect voter intent. But if the reported outcomes of the contests
differ from the outcomes that a full hand count would show, step (3) is

170,"Voter Verification of BMD Ballots Is a Two-Part Question: Can They? Mostly, They Can. Do They? Mostly, They Don't","The question of whether or not voters actually verify ballots produced by
ballot marking devices (BMDs) is presently the subject of some controversy.
Recent studies (e.g., Bernhard, et al. 2020) suggest the verification rate is
low. What is not clear from previous research is whether this is more a result
of voters being unable to do so accurately or whether this is because voters
simply choose not to attempt verification in the first place. In order to
understand this problem, we conducted an experiment in which 108 participants
participated in a mock election where the BMD displayed the voters' true
choices, but then changed a subset of those choices on the printed ballot. The
design of the printed ballot, the length of the ballot, the number of changes
that were made to the ballot, the location of those changes, and the
instructions provided to the voters were manipulated as part of the experiment.
Results indicated that of those voters who chose to examine the printed ballot,
76% detected anomalies, indicating that voters can reliably detect errors on
their ballot if they will simply review it. This suggests that administrative
remedies, rather than attempts to alter fundamental human perceptual

Ballot-polling audits select ballots at random and interpret those ballots as
evidence for and against the reported result, continuing this process until
either they support the recorded result, or they fall back to a full manual
recount. For elections with digitised scanning and counting of ballots, a
comparison audit compares randomly selected digital ballots with their paper
versions. Discrepancies are referred to as errors, and are used to build
evidence against or in support of the recorded result. Risk-limiting audits for
first-past-the-post elections are well understood, and used in some US
elections. We define a number of approaches to ballot-polling and comparison
risk-limiting audits for Instant Runoff Voting (IRV) elections. We show that
for almost all real elections we found, we can perform a risk-limiting audit by
looking at only a small fraction of the total ballots (assuming no errors were

traditional plurality voting in which voters submit rankings over the
candidates rather than single votes. In practice, elections using IRV often
restrict the ballot length, the number of candidates a voter is allowed to rank
on their ballot. We theoretically and empirically analyze how ballot length can
influence the outcome of an election, given fixed voter preferences. We show
that there exist preference profiles over $k$ candidates such that up to $k-1$
different candidates win at different ballot lengths. We derive exact lower
bounds on the number of voters required for such profiles and provide a
construction matching the lower bound for unrestricted voter preferences.
Additionally, we characterize which sequences of winners are possible over
ballot lengths and provide explicit profile constructions achieving any
feasible winner sequence. We also examine how classic preference restrictions
influence our results--for instance, single-peakedness makes $k-1$ different
winners impossible but still allows at least $\Omega(\sqrt k)$. Finally, we
analyze a collection of 168 real-world elections, where we truncate rankings to
simulate shorter ballots. We find that shorter ballots could have changed the
outcome in one quarter of these elections. Our results highlight ballot length
as a consequential degree of freedom in the design of IRV elections.",2207.08958v3,cs.MA,2022-07-18 22:01:13+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Kiran Tomlinson'), arxiv.Result.Author('Johan Ugander'), arxiv.Result.Author('Jon Kleinberg')]",

analyze some of the largest real-world systems, describe their building blocks

voting systems.
  Furthermore, we present a template for an e-voting system, which we designed
to try to fulfill the preliminaries and requirements of a secure electronic
voting system. We use the experiences and the building blocks of existing
systems to combine them to another more secure system. Afterwards, we compare
our concept with real-world systems to evaluate the fulfillments of the
requirements. Conclusively, we discuss the occurring problems when designing a
secure system.
  Peer-to-peer networks provide many advantages, like decentralization, which
might be applicable to electronic voting systems. Therefore, we take a look on
the distributed database called blockchain and the usage in a peer-to-peer
voting system. Our contribution to this topic is a modification of the
proof-of-stake, which enables the usage of common devices, like smartphones or

180,Limiting Risk by Turning Manifest Phantoms into Evil Zombies,"Drawing a random sample of ballots to conduct a risk-limiting audit generally
requires knowing how the ballots cast in an election are organized into groups,
for instance, how many containers of ballots there are in all and how many
ballots are in each container. A list of the ballot group identifiers along
with number of ballots in each group is called a ballot manifest. What if the
ballot manifest is not accurate? Surprisingly, even if ballots are known to be
missing from the manifest, it is not necessary to make worst-case assumptions
about those ballots--for instance, to adjust the margin by the number of
missing ballots--to ensure that the audit remains conservative. Rather, it
suffices to make worst-case assumptions about the individual randomly selected
ballots that the audit cannot find. This observation provides a simple
modification to some risk-limiting audit procedures that makes them
automatically become more conservative if the ballot manifest has errors. The
modification--phantoms to evil zombies (~2EZ)--requires only an upper bound on
the total number of ballots cast. ~2EZ makes the audit P-value stochastically
larger than it would be had the manifest been accurate, automatically requiring
more than enough ballots to be audited to offset the manifest errors. This
ensures that the true risk limit remains smaller than the nominal risk limit.
On the other hand, if the manifest is in fact accurate and the upper bound on
the total number of ballots equals the total according to the manifest, ~2EZ
has no effect at all on the number of ballots audited nor on the true risk
limit.",1207.3413v1,stat.AP,2012-07-14 11:26:02+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Jorge H. Banuelos'), arxiv.Result.Author('Philip B. Stark')]",

ballots from the top to the bottom of the stack, and then picking the ballot on
top. Unlike conventional methods of picking a ballot at random, $k$-cut does
not require identification numbers on the ballots or counting many ballots per
draw. We analyze how close the distribution of chosen ballots is to the uniform
distribution, and design different mitigation procedures. We show that $k=6$

it does not require a ballot manifest; (2) it can be conducted independently at
different locations, rather than requiring a central authority to select the
sample from the whole population of cast ballots or requiring stratified
sampling; (3) it can start in polling places on election night, before margins
are known. If the reported margins for the 2016 U.S. Presidential election are
correct, a Bernoulli ballot-polling audit with a risk limit of 5% and a
sampling rate of $p_0 = 1\%$ would have had at least a 99% probability of
confirming the outcome in 42 states. (The other states were more likely to have
needed to examine additional ballots.) Logistical and security advantages that
auditing in the polling place affords may outweigh the cost of examining more

justifiably high confidence that the reported results of an election are
consistent with an audit trail (""ballots""), which can be paper or electronic.
SOBA combines three ideas: (1) publishing cast vote records (CVRs) separately
for each contest, so that anyone can verify that each reported contest outcome
is correct, if the CVRs reflect voters' intentions with sufficient accuracy;
(2) shrouding a mapping between ballots and the CVRs for those ballots to
prevent the loss of privacy that could occur otherwise; (3) assessing the
accuracy with which the CVRs reflect voters' intentions for a collection of
contests while simultaneously assessing the integrity of the shrouded mapping
between ballots and CVRs by comparing randomly selected ballots to the CVRs
that purport to represent them. Step (1) is related to work by the Humboldt
County Election Transparency Project, but publishing CVRs separately for
individual contests rather than images of entire ballots preserves privacy.
Step (2) requires a cryptographic commitment from elections officials.
Observers participate in step (3), which relies on the ""super-simple
simultaneous single-ballot risk-limiting audit."" Step (3) is designed to reveal
relatively few ballots if the shrouded mapping is proper and the CVRs
accurately reflect voter intent. But if the reported outcomes of the contests
differ from the outcomes that a full hand count would show, step (3) is
guaranteed to have a large chance of requiring all the ballots to be counted by
hand, thereby limiting the risk that an incorrect outcome will become official

ballot marking devices (BMDs) is presently the subject of some controversy.
Recent studies (e.g., Bernhard, et al. 2020) suggest the verification rate is
low. What is not clear from previous research is whether this is more a result
of voters being unable to do so accurately or whether this is because voters
simply choose not to attempt verification in the first place. In order to
understand this problem, we conducted an experiment in which 108 participants
participated in a mock election where the BMD displayed the voters' true
choices, but then changed a subset of those choices on the printed ballot. The
design of the printed ballot, the length of the ballot, the number of changes
that were made to the ballot, the location of those changes, and the
instructions provided to the voters were manipulated as part of the experiment.
Results indicated that of those voters who chose to examine the printed ballot,
76% detected anomalies, indicating that voters can reliably detect errors on
their ballot if they will simply review it. This suggests that administrative
remedies, rather than attempts to alter fundamental human perceptual
capabilities, could be employed to encourage voters to check their ballots,

traditional plurality voting in which voters submit rankings over the
candidates rather than single votes. In practice, elections using IRV often
restrict the ballot length, the number of candidates a voter is allowed to rank
on their ballot. We theoretically and empirically analyze how ballot length can
influence the outcome of an election, given fixed voter preferences. We show
that there exist preference profiles over $k$ candidates such that up to $k-1$
different candidates win at different ballot lengths. We derive exact lower
bounds on the number of voters required for such profiles and provide a
construction matching the lower bound for unrestricted voter preferences.
Additionally, we characterize which sequences of winners are possible over
ballot lengths and provide explicit profile constructions achieving any
feasible winner sequence. We also examine how classic preference restrictions
influence our results--for instance, single-peakedness makes $k-1$ different
winners impossible but still allows at least $\Omega(\sqrt k)$. Finally, we
analyze a collection of 168 real-world elections, where we truncate rankings to
simulate shorter ballots. We find that shorter ballots could have changed the
outcome in one quarter of these elections. Our results highlight ballot length
as a consequential degree of freedom in the design of IRV elections.",2207.08958v3,cs.MA,2022-07-18 22:01:13+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Kiran Tomlinson'), arxiv.Result.Author('Johan Ugander'), arxiv.Result.Author('Jon Kleinberg')]",

200,Limiting Risk by Turning Manifest Phantoms into Evil Zombies,"Drawing a random sample of ballots to conduct a risk-limiting audit generally
requires knowing how the ballots cast in an election are organized into groups,
for instance, how many containers of ballots there are in all and how many
ballots are in each container. A list of the ballot group identifiers along
with number of ballots in each group is called a ballot manifest. What if the
ballot manifest is not accurate? Surprisingly, even if ballots are known to be
missing from the manifest, it is not necessary to make worst-case assumptions
about those ballots--for instance, to adjust the margin by the number of
missing ballots--to ensure that the audit remains conservative. Rather, it
suffices to make worst-case assumptions about the individual randomly selected
ballots that the audit cannot find. This observation provides a simple
modification to some risk-limiting audit procedures that makes them
automatically become more conservative if the ballot manifest has errors. The
modification--phantoms to evil zombies (~2EZ)--requires only an upper bound on
the total number of ballots cast. ~2EZ makes the audit P-value stochastically
larger than it would be had the manifest been accurate, automatically requiring
more than enough ballots to be audited to offset the manifest errors. This
ensures that the true risk limit remains smaller than the nominal risk limit.
On the other hand, if the manifest is in fact accurate and the upper bound on
the total number of ballots equals the total according to the manifest, ~2EZ
has no effect at all on the number of ballots audited nor on the true risk
limit.",1207.3413v1,stat.AP,2012-07-14 11:26:02+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Jorge H. Banuelos'), arxiv.Result.Author('Philip B. Stark')]",

202,"More style, less work: card-style data decrease risk-limiting audit sample sizes","U.S. elections rely heavily on computers such as voter registration
databases, electronic pollbooks, voting machines, scanners, tabulators, and
results reporting websites. These introduce digital threats to election
outcomes. Risk-limiting audits (RLAs) mitigate threats to some of these systems
by manually inspecting random samples of ballot cards. RLAs have a large chance
of correcting wrong outcomes (by conducting a full manual tabulation of a
trustworthy record of the votes), but can save labor when reported outcomes are
correct. This efficiency is eroded when sampling cannot be targeted to ballot
cards that contain the contest(s) under audit. If the sample is drawn from all
cast cards, RLA sample sizes scale like the reciprocal of the fraction of
ballot cards that contain the contest(s) under audit. That fraction shrinks as
the number of cards per ballot grows (i.e., when elections contain more
contests) and as the fraction of ballots that contain the contest decreases
(i.e., when a smaller percentage of voters are eligible to vote in the
contest). States that conduct RLAs of contests on multi-card ballots or of
small contests can dramatically reduce sample sizes by using information about
which ballot cards contain which contests -- by keeping track of card-style
data (CSD). For instance, CSD reduces the expected number of draws needed to
audit a single countywide contest on a 4-card ballot by 75%. Similarly, CSD
reduces the expected number of draws by 95% or more for an audit of two
contests with the same margin on a 4-card ballot if one contest is on every
ballot and the other is on 10% of ballots. In realistic examples, the savings
can be several orders of magnitude.",2012.03371v1,cs.CR,2020-12-06 20:35:12+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Amanda K. Glazer'), arxiv.Result.Author('Jacob V. Spertus'), arxiv.Result.Author('Philip B. Stark')]",

specifically apply novel statistical forensics tests to further identify the
specific nature of electoral malpractices. In particular, we test whether the
data contains fingerprints for ballot-stuffing (submission of multiple ballots
per person during the vote) and voter rigging (coercion and intimidation of
voters). Additionally, we perform tests to identify numerical anomalies in the
election results. We find systematic and highly significant support for the
presence of both, ballot-stuffing and voter rigging. In 6% of stations we find
signs for ballot-stuffing with an error (probability of ballot-stuffing not

perform with near-perfect accuracy regardless of ballot length, ballot type,
number of altered races, and location of altered races. Detection performance
was extremely robust. We conclude that with proper direction and resources,
voters can be near-perfect detectors of ballot changes on printed paper ballots

contrast, decoy voters are trapped into selling their ballots at a low, or even

214,The ATHENA Class of Risk-Limiting Ballot Polling Audits,"The main risk-limiting ballot polling audit in use today, BRAVO, is designed
for use when single ballots are drawn at random and a decision regarding
whether to stop the audit or draw another ballot is taken after each ballot
draw (ballot-by-ballot (B2) audits). On the other hand, real ballot polling
audits draw many ballots in a single round before determining whether to stop
(round-by-round (R2) audits). We show that BRAVO results in significant
inefficiency when directly applied to real R2 audits. We present the ATHENA
class of R2 stopping rules, which we show are risk-limiting if the round
schedule is pre-determined (before the audit begins). We prove that each rule
is at least as efficient as the corresponding BRAVO stopping rule applied at
the end of the round. We have open-source software libraries implementing most
of our results.
  We show that ATHENA halves the number of ballots required, for all state
margins in the 2016 US Presidential election and a first round with $90\%$
stopping probability, when compared to BRAVO (stopping rule applied at the end
of the round). We present simulation results supporting the 90% stopping
probability claims and our claims for the risk accrued in the first round.
Further, ATHENA reduces the number of ballots by more than a quarter for low
margins, when compared to the BRAVO stopping rule applied on ballots in
selection order. This implies that keeping track of the order when drawing
ballots R2 is not beneficial, because ATHENA is more efficient even without
information on selection order. These results are significant because current
approaches to real ballot polling election audits use the B2 BRAVO rules,
requiring about twice as much work on the part of election officials. Applying
the rules in selection order requires fewer ballots, but keeping track of the
order, and entering it into audit software, adds to the effort.",2008.02315v5,cs.CR,2020-08-05 18:47:37+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Filip Zagórski'), arxiv.Result.Author('Grant McClearn'), arxiv.Result.Author('Sarah Morin'), arxiv.Result.Author('Neal McBurnett'), arxiv.Result.Author('Poorvi L.

Our method involves doing $k$ ""cuts"", each involving moving a random portion of
ballots from the top to the bottom of the stack, and then picking the ballot on
top. Unlike conventional methods of picking a ballot at random, $k$-cut does
not require identification numbers on the ballots or counting many ballots per
draw. We analyze how close the distribution of chosen ballots is to the uniform
distribution, and design different mitigation procedures. We show that $k=6$

justifiably high confidence that the reported results of an election are
consistent with an audit trail (""ballots""), which can be paper or electronic.
SOBA combines three ideas: (1) publishing cast vote records (CVRs) separately
for each contest, so that anyone can verify that each reported contest outcome
is correct, if the CVRs reflect voters' intentions with sufficient accuracy;
(2) shrouding a mapping between ballots and the CVRs for those ballots to
prevent the loss of privacy that could occur otherwise; (3) assessing the
accuracy with which the CVRs reflect voters' intentions for a collection of
contests while simultaneously assessing the integrity of the shrouded mapping
between ballots and CVRs by comparing randomly selected ballots to the CVRs
that purport to represent them. Step (1) is related to work by the Humboldt
County Election Transparency Project, but publishing CVRs separately for
individual contests rather than images of entire ballots preserves privacy.
Step (2) requires a cryptographic commitment from elections officials.
Observers participate in step (3), which relies on the ""super-simple
simultaneous single-ballot risk-limiting audit."" Step (3) is designed to reveal
relatively few ballots if the shrouded mapping is proper and the CVRs
accurately reflect voter intent. But if the reported outcomes of the contests
differ from the outcomes that a full hand count would show, step (3) is

219,"Voter Verification of BMD Ballots Is a Two-Part Question: Can They? Mostly, They Can. Do They? Mostly, They Don't","The question of whether or not voters actually verify ballots produced by
ballot marking devices (BMDs) is presently the subject of some controversy.
Recent studies (e.g., Bernhard, et al. 2020) suggest the verification rate is
low. What is not clear from previous research is whether this is more a result
of voters being unable to do so accurately or whether this is because voters
simply choose not to attempt verification in the first place. In order to
understand this problem, we conducted an experiment in which 108 participants
participated in a mock election where the BMD displayed the voters' true
choices, but then changed a subset of those choices on the printed ballot. The
design of the printed ballot, the length of the ballot, the number of changes
that were made to the ballot, the location of those changes, and the
instructions provided to the voters were manipulated as part of the experiment.
Results indicated that of those voters who chose to examine the printed ballot,
76% detected anomalies, indicating that voters can reliably detect errors on
their ballot if they will simply review it. This suggests that administrative
remedies, rather than attempts to alter fundamental human perceptual
capabilities, could be employed to encourage voters to check their ballots,
which could prove as an effective countermeasure.",2003.04997v1,cs.HC,2020-03-10 21:06:42+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Philip Kortum'), arxiv.Result.Author('Michael D. Byrne'), arxiv.Result.Author('Julie Whitmore')]",

In this study, we altered votes on a voter's ballot after they had made their
selections on a BMD. We then required them to examine their ballots for any
changes from the slate they used to vote. Overall accuracy was exceptionally
high. Participants saw 1440 total contests, and of those 1440, there were a
total of 4 errors, so total accuracy was 99.8%. Participants were able to
perform with near-perfect accuracy regardless of ballot length, ballot type,
number of altered races, and location of altered races. Detection performance
was extremely robust. We conclude that with proper direction and resources,
voters can be near-perfect detectors of ballot changes on printed paper ballots
after voting with a BMD. This finding has significant implications for the
voting community as BMD use continues to grow. Research should now focus on
identifying administrative and behavioral methods that will prompt and
encourage voters to check their BMD-generated ballots before they drop them in

224,"Voting on Cyclic Orders, Group Theory, and Ballots","A cyclic order may be thought of informally as a way to seat people around a
table, perhaps for a game of chance or for dinner. Given a set of agents such
as $\{A,B,C\}$, we can formalize this by defining a cyclic order as a
permutation or linear order on this finite set, under the equivalence relation
where $A\succ B\succ C$ is identified with both $B\succ C\succ A$ and $C\succ
A\succ B$. As with other collections of sets with some structure, we might want
to aggregate preferences of a (possibly different) set of voters on the set of
possible ways to choose a cyclic order.
  However, given the combinatorial explosion of the number of full rankings of
cyclic orders, one may not wish to use the usual voting machinery. This raises
the question of what sort of ballots may be appropriate; a single cyclic order,
a set of them, or some other ballot type? Further, there is a natural action of
the group of permutations on the set of agents. A reasonable requirement for a
choice procedure would be to respect this symmetry (the equivalent of
neutrality in normal voting theory).
  In this paper we will exploit the representation theory of the symmetric
group to analyze several natural types of ballots for voting on cyclic orders,
and points-based procedures using such ballots. We provide a full
characterization of such procedures for two quite different ballot types for

227,Limiting Risk by Turning Manifest Phantoms into Evil Zombies,"Drawing a random sample of ballots to conduct a risk-limiting audit generally
requires knowing how the ballots cast in an election are organized into groups,
for instance, how many containers of ballots there are in all and how many
ballots are in each container. A list of the ballot group identifiers along
with number of ballots in each group is called a ballot manifest. What if the
ballot manifest is not accurate? Surprisingly, even if ballots are known to be
missing from the manifest, it is not necessary to make worst-case assumptions
about those ballots--for instance, to adjust the margin by the number of
missing ballots--to ensure that the audit remains conservative. Rather, it
suffices to make worst-case assumptions about the individual randomly selected
ballots that the audit cannot find. This observation provides a simple
modification to some risk-limiting audit procedures that makes them
automatically become more conservative if the ballot manifest has errors. The
modification--phantoms to evil zombies (~2EZ)--requires only an upper bound on
the total number of ballots cast. ~2EZ makes the audit P-value stochastically
larger than it would be had the manifest been accurate, automatically requiring
more than enough ballots to be audited to offset the manifest errors. This
ensures that the true risk limit remains smaller than the nominal risk limit.
On the other hand, if the manifest is in fact accurate and the upper bound on
the total number of ballots equals the total according to the manifest, ~2EZ
has no effect at all on the number of ballots audited nor on the true risk
limit.",1207.3413v1,stat.AP,2012-07-14 11:26:02+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Jorge H. Banuelos'), arxiv.Result.Author('Philip B. Stark')]",

systematic bias into election results. This is because, even if the errors are
random, votes for different candidates occur in different patterns that are
affected differently by random errors. In the STV context, the most important
effect of random errors is to invalidate the ballot. This removes far more
votes for those candidates whose supporters tend to list a lot of preferences,
because their ballots are much more likely to be invalidated by random error.
Different validity rules for different voting styles mean that errors are much
more likely to penalise some types of votes than others. For close elections

of unravelling procedures that transform the delegation ballots received from

real ballots of any strict subset of districts at a price corresponding to the
willingness to sell on the part of the citizens holding such ballots. By
contrast, decoy voters are trapped into selling their ballots at a low, or even
negligible, price. Blowing up the adversary's budget by introducing decoy

for use when single ballots are drawn at random and a decision regarding
whether to stop the audit or draw another ballot is taken after each ballot
draw (ballot-by-ballot (B2) audits). On the other hand, real ballot polling
audits draw many ballots in a single round before determining whether to stop
(round-by-round (R2) audits). We show that BRAVO results in significant
inefficiency when directly applied to real R2 audits. We present the ATHENA
class of R2 stopping rules, which we show are risk-limiting if the round
schedule is pre-determined (before the audit begins). We prove that each rule
is at least as efficient as the corresponding BRAVO stopping rule applied at
the end of the round. We have open-source software libraries implementing most
of our results.
  We show that ATHENA halves the number of ballots required, for all state
margins in the 2016 US Presidential election and a first round with $90\%$
stopping probability, when compared to BRAVO (stopping rule applied at the end
of the round). We present simulation results supporting the 90% stopping
probability claims and our claims for the risk accrued in the first round.
Further, ATHENA reduces the number of ballots by more than a quarter for low
margins, when compared to the BRAVO stopping rule applied on ballots in
selection order. This implies that keeping track of the order when drawing
ballots R2 is not beneficial, because ATHENA is more efficient even without
information on selection order. These results are significant because current
approaches to real ballot polling election audits use the B2 BRAVO rules,
requiring about twice as much work on the part of election officials. Applying
the rules in selection order requires fewer ballots, but keeping track of the
order, and entering it into audit software, adds to the effort.",2008.02315v5,cs.CR,2020-08-05 18:47:37+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Filip Zagórski'), arxiv.Result.Author('Grant McClearn'), arxiv.Result.Author('Sarah Morin'), arxiv.Result.Author('Neal McBurnett'), arxiv.Result.Author('Poorvi L.

top. Unlike conventional methods of picking a ballot at random, $k$-cut does
not require identification numbers on the ballots or counting many ballots per
draw. We analyze how close the distribution of chosen ballots is to the uniform

240,Can Voters Detect Errors on Their Printed Ballots? Absolutely,"There is still debate on whether voters can detect malicious changes in their
printed ballot after making their selections on a Ballot Marking Device (BMD).
In this study, we altered votes on a voter's ballot after they had made their
selections on a BMD. We then required them to examine their ballots for any
changes from the slate they used to vote. Overall accuracy was exceptionally
high. Participants saw 1440 total contests, and of those 1440, there were a
total of 4 errors, so total accuracy was 99.8%. Participants were able to
perform with near-perfect accuracy regardless of ballot length, ballot type,
number of altered races, and location of altered races. Detection performance
was extremely robust. We conclude that with proper direction and resources,
voters can be near-perfect detectors of ballot changes on printed paper ballots
after voting with a BMD. This finding has significant implications for the
voting community as BMD use continues to grow. Research should now focus on
identifying administrative and behavioral methods that will prompt and

actually cast their vote. So far, the combination of ballot stuffing and
participation privacy has been mostly studied for internet voting, where voters
are assumed to own trusted computing devices. Such approaches are inapplicable
to pollsite voting where voters typically vote bare handed. We present an
eligibility audit protocol to detect ballot stuffing in pollsite voting
protocols. This is done while protecting participation privacy from a remote
observer - one who does not physically observe voters during voting. Our
protocol can be instantiated as an additional layer on top of most existing
pollsite E2E-V voting protocols. To achieve our guarantees, we develop an
efficient zero-knowledge proof (ZKP), that, given a value $v$ and a set $\Phi$

revealing which one. We call this a ZKP of reverse set membership because of

traditional plurality voting in which voters submit rankings over the
candidates rather than single votes. In practice, elections using IRV often
restrict the ballot length, the number of candidates a voter is allowed to rank
on their ballot. We theoretically and empirically analyze how ballot length can
influence the outcome of an election, given fixed voter preferences. We show
that there exist preference profiles over $k$ candidates such that up to $k-1$
different candidates win at different ballot lengths. We derive exact lower
bounds on the number of voters required for such profiles and provide a
construction matching the lower bound for unrestricted voter preferences.
Additionally, we characterize which sequences of winners are possible over
ballot lengths and provide explicit profile constructions achieving any
feasible winner sequence. We also examine how classic preference restrictions
influence our results--for instance, single-peakedness makes $k-1$ different
winners impossible but still allows at least $\Omega(\sqrt k)$. Finally, we
analyze a collection of 168 real-world elections, where we truncate rankings to
simulate shorter ballots. We find that shorter ballots could have changed the
outcome in one quarter of these elections. Our results highlight ballot length
as a consequential degree of freedom in the design of IRV elections.",2207.08958v3,cs.MA,2022-07-18 22:01:13+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Kiran Tomlinson'), arxiv.Result.Author('Johan Ugander'), arxiv.Result.Author('Jon Kleinberg')]",
245,Non(c)esuch Ballot-Level Risk-Limiting Audits for Precinct-Count Voting Systems,"Risk-limiting audits (RLAs) guarantee a high probability of correcting
incorrect reported outcomes before the outcomes are certified. The most
efficient use ballot-level comparison, comparing the voting system's
interpretation of individual ballot cards sampled at random (cast-vote records,
CVRs) from a trustworthy paper trail to a human interpretation of the same
cards. Such comparisons require the voting system to create and export CVRs in
a way that can be linked to the individual ballots the CVRs purport to
represent. Such links can be created by keeping the ballots in the order in
which they are scanned or by printing a unique serial number on each ballot.
But for precinct-count systems (PCOS), these strategies may compromise vote
anonymity: the order in which ballots are cast may identify the voters who cast
them. Printing a unique pseudo-random number (""cryptographic nonce"") on each
ballot card after the voter last touches it could reduce such privacy risks.
But what if the system does not in fact print a unique number on each ballot or
does not accurately report the numbers it printed? This paper gives two ways to
conduct an RLA so that even if the system does not print a genuine nonce on
each ballot or misreports the nonces it used, the audit's risk limit is not
compromised (however, the anonymity of votes might be compromised). One method
allows untrusted technology to be used to imprint and to retrieve ballot cards.
The method is adaptive: if the technology behaves properly, this protection
does not increase the audit workload. But if the imprinting or retrieval system
misbehaves, the sample size the RLA requires to confirm the reported results
when the results are correct is generally larger than if the imprinting and

from academic societies and associations to public elections. In such
elections, it is often the case that ballot-length restrictions are enforced;
that is, where voters have a limit on the number of candidates which they can
vote for. Despite this common feature, there does not seem to be any
theoretical justification for ballot-length restrictions (Laslier and Van der
Straeten, 2016).
  This work endogenously derives the set of voter best-response ballot lengths
under complete information and with general assumptions on voter utilities and
voting rules. These results provide justification for some ballot-length
restrictions observed in practice, however when considering equilibrium
outcomes our analysis shows that this justification is no longer valid.
Equilibrium analysis is considered for voters with lazy and truth-bias
second-order tendencies and the equilibrium solution concept is pure-Nash
equilibria.
  The key insights show that ballot-length restrictions or institutional
features which make voting costly may lead to instability in election outcomes
when voters have diverse preferences, via the non-existence of equilibria. On
the other hand, when equilibria do exist they satisfy desirable properties
which are not guaranteed by equilibria attained under costless voting and in
the absence of ballot-length restrictions. In summary our results highlight a

participants in a boardroom election have limited privacy, the protocol ensures
that no one can determine how others voted. Moreover, each voter can verify
that their ballot was correctly cast, collected, and counted, without being
able to prove how they voted, providing assurance against undue influence.

the research effort is put into developing protocols and machines for poll-site

cannot be directly adopted to Internet voting because of secure platform

This paper presents a scheme based on combination of mixnets and homomorphic
encryption borrowed from robust poll-site voting, along with techniques
recommended for remote voting -- code sheets and test ballots. The protocol
tries to minimize the trust put in voter's PC by making the voter responsible
for manual encryption of his vote. To achieve this, the voter obtains a paper
ballot that allows him to scramble the vote by performing simple operations
(lookup in a table). Creation of paper ballots, as well as decryption of votes,
is performed by a group of cooperating trusted servers. As a result, the scheme
is characterized by strong asymmetry -- all computations are carried out on the

(2) shrouding a mapping between ballots and the CVRs for those ballots to

accuracy with which the CVRs reflect voters' intentions for a collection of

258,Sets of Half-Average Nulls Generate Risk-Limiting Audits: SHANGRLA,"Risk-limiting audits (RLAs) for many social choice functions can be reduced
to testing sets of null hypotheses of the form ""the average of this list is not
greater than 1/2"" for a collection of finite lists of nonnegative numbers. Such
social choice functions include majority, super-majority, plurality,
multi-winner plurality, Instant Runoff Voting (IRV), Borda count, approval
voting, and STAR-Voting, among others. The audit stops without a full hand
count iff all the null hypotheses are rejected. The nulls can be tested in many
ways. Ballot-polling is particularly simple; two new ballot-polling
risk-measuring functions for sampling without replacement are given.
Ballot-level comparison audits transform each null into an equivalent assertion
that the mean of re-scaled tabulation errors is not greater than 1/2. In turn,
that null can then be tested using the same statistical methods used for ballot
polling---but applied to different finite lists of nonnegative numbers.
SHANGRLA comparison audits are more efficient than previous comparison audits
for two reasons: (i) for most social choice functions, the conditions tested
are both necessary and sufficient for the reported outcome to be correct, while
previous methods tested conditions that were sufficient but not necessary, and
(ii) the tests avoid a conservative approximation. The SHANGRLA abstraction
simplifies stratified audits, including audits that combine ballot polling with
ballot-level comparisons, producing sharper audits than the ""SUITE"" approach.
SHANGRLA works with the ""phantoms to evil zombies"" strategy to treat missing
ballot cards and missing or redacted cast vote records. That also facilitates
sampling from ""ballot-style manifests,"" which can dramatically improve

259,"More style, less work: card-style data decrease risk-limiting audit sample sizes","U.S. elections rely heavily on computers such as voter registration
databases, electronic pollbooks, voting machines, scanners, tabulators, and
results reporting websites. These introduce digital threats to election
outcomes. Risk-limiting audits (RLAs) mitigate threats to some of these systems
by manually inspecting random samples of ballot cards. RLAs have a large chance
of correcting wrong outcomes (by conducting a full manual tabulation of a
trustworthy record of the votes), but can save labor when reported outcomes are
correct. This efficiency is eroded when sampling cannot be targeted to ballot
cards that contain the contest(s) under audit. If the sample is drawn from all
cast cards, RLA sample sizes scale like the reciprocal of the fraction of
ballot cards that contain the contest(s) under audit. That fraction shrinks as
the number of cards per ballot grows (i.e., when elections contain more
contests) and as the fraction of ballots that contain the contest decreases
(i.e., when a smaller percentage of voters are eligible to vote in the
contest). States that conduct RLAs of contests on multi-card ballots or of
small contests can dramatically reduce sample sizes by using information about
which ballot cards contain which contests -- by keeping track of card-style
data (CSD). For instance, CSD reduces the expected number of draws needed to
audit a single countywide contest on a 4-card ballot by 75%. Similarly, CSD
reduces the expected number of draws by 95% or more for an audit of two

265,The ATHENA Class of Risk-Limiting Ballot Polling Audits,"The main risk-limiting ballot polling audit in use today, BRAVO, is designed
for use when single ballots are drawn at random and a decision regarding
whether to stop the audit or draw another ballot is taken after each ballot
draw (ballot-by-ballot (B2) audits). On the other hand, real ballot polling
audits draw many ballots in a single round before determining whether to stop
(round-by-round (R2) audits). We show that BRAVO results in significant
inefficiency when directly applied to real R2 audits. We present the ATHENA
class of R2 stopping rules, which we show are risk-limiting if the round
schedule is pre-determined (before the audit begins). We prove that each rule
is at least as efficient as the corresponding BRAVO stopping rule applied at
the end of the round. We have open-source software libraries implementing most
of our results.
  We show that ATHENA halves the number of ballots required, for all state
margins in the 2016 US Presidential election and a first round with $90\%$
stopping probability, when compared to BRAVO (stopping rule applied at the end
of the round). We present simulation results supporting the 90% stopping
probability claims and our claims for the risk accrued in the first round.
Further, ATHENA reduces the number of ballots by more than a quarter for low
margins, when compared to the BRAVO stopping rule applied on ballots in
selection order. This implies that keeping track of the order when drawing
ballots R2 is not beneficial, because ATHENA is more efficient even without
information on selection order. These results are significant because current
approaches to real ballot polling election audits use the B2 BRAVO rules,
requiring about twice as much work on the part of election officials. Applying
the rules in selection order requires fewer ballots, but keeping track of the
order, and entering it into audit software, adds to the effort.",2008.02315v5,cs.CR,2020-08-05 18:47:37+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Filip Zagórski'), arxiv.Result.Author('Grant McClearn'), arxiv.Result.Author('Sarah Morin'), arxiv.Result.Author('Neal McBurnett'), arxiv.Result.Author('Poorvi L.

top. Unlike conventional methods of picking a ballot at random, $k$-cut does
not require identification numbers on the ballots or counting many ballots per

justifiably high confidence that the reported results of an election are
consistent with an audit trail (""ballots""), which can be paper or electronic.
SOBA combines three ideas: (1) publishing cast vote records (CVRs) separately
for each contest, so that anyone can verify that each reported contest outcome
is correct, if the CVRs reflect voters' intentions with sufficient accuracy;
(2) shrouding a mapping between ballots and the CVRs for those ballots to
prevent the loss of privacy that could occur otherwise; (3) assessing the
accuracy with which the CVRs reflect voters' intentions for a collection of
contests while simultaneously assessing the integrity of the shrouded mapping
between ballots and CVRs by comparing randomly selected ballots to the CVRs
that purport to represent them. Step (1) is related to work by the Humboldt
County Election Transparency Project, but publishing CVRs separately for
individual contests rather than images of entire ballots preserves privacy.
Step (2) requires a cryptographic commitment from elections officials.
Observers participate in step (3), which relies on the ""super-simple
simultaneous single-ballot risk-limiting audit."" Step (3) is designed to reveal
relatively few ballots if the shrouded mapping is proper and the CVRs
accurately reflect voter intent. But if the reported outcomes of the contests

Recent studies (e.g., Bernhard, et al. 2020) suggest the verification rate is
low. What is not clear from previous research is whether this is more a result
of voters being unable to do so accurately or whether this is because voters
simply choose not to attempt verification in the first place. In order to
understand this problem, we conducted an experiment in which 108 participants
participated in a mock election where the BMD displayed the voters' true
choices, but then changed a subset of those choices on the printed ballot. The
design of the printed ballot, the length of the ballot, the number of changes
that were made to the ballot, the location of those changes, and the
instructions provided to the voters were manipulated as part of the experiment.
Results indicated that of those voters who chose to examine the printed ballot,
76% detected anomalies, indicating that voters can reliably detect errors on
their ballot if they will simply review it. This suggests that administrative

on their ballot. We theoretically and empirically analyze how ballot length can
influence the outcome of an election, given fixed voter preferences. We show
that there exist preference profiles over $k$ candidates such that up to $k-1$
different candidates win at different ballot lengths. We derive exact lower
bounds on the number of voters required for such profiles and provide a
construction matching the lower bound for unrestricted voter preferences.
Additionally, we characterize which sequences of winners are possible over
ballot lengths and provide explicit profile constructions achieving any
feasible winner sequence. We also examine how classic preference restrictions
influence our results--for instance, single-peakedness makes $k-1$ different
winners impossible but still allows at least $\Omega(\sqrt k)$. Finally, we
analyze a collection of 168 real-world elections, where we truncate rankings to
simulate shorter ballots. We find that shorter ballots could have changed the
outcome in one quarter of these elections. Our results highlight ballot length

286,The ATHENA Class of Risk-Limiting Ballot Polling Audits,"The main risk-limiting ballot polling audit in use today, BRAVO, is designed
for use when single ballots are drawn at random and a decision regarding
whether to stop the audit or draw another ballot is taken after each ballot
draw (ballot-by-ballot (B2) audits). On the other hand, real ballot polling
audits draw many ballots in a single round before determining whether to stop
(round-by-round (R2) audits). We show that BRAVO results in significant
inefficiency when directly applied to real R2 audits. We present the ATHENA
class of R2 stopping rules, which we show are risk-limiting if the round
schedule is pre-determined (before the audit begins). We prove that each rule
is at least as efficient as the corresponding BRAVO stopping rule applied at
the end of the round. We have open-source software libraries implementing most
of our results.
  We show that ATHENA halves the number of ballots required, for all state
margins in the 2016 US Presidential election and a first round with $90\%$
stopping probability, when compared to BRAVO (stopping rule applied at the end
of the round). We present simulation results supporting the 90% stopping
probability claims and our claims for the risk accrued in the first round.
Further, ATHENA reduces the number of ballots by more than a quarter for low
margins, when compared to the BRAVO stopping rule applied on ballots in
selection order. This implies that keeping track of the order when drawing
ballots R2 is not beneficial, because ATHENA is more efficient even without
information on selection order. These results are significant because current
approaches to real ballot polling election audits use the B2 BRAVO rules,
requiring about twice as much work on the part of election officials. Applying
the rules in selection order requires fewer ballots, but keeping track of the
order, and entering it into audit software, adds to the effort.",2008.02315v5,cs.CR,2020-08-05 18:47:37+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Filip Zagórski'), arxiv.Result.Author('Grant McClearn'), arxiv.Result.Author('Sarah Morin'), arxiv.Result.Author('Neal McBurnett'), arxiv.Result.Author('Poorvi L.

287,$k$-Cut: A Simple Approximately-Uniform Method for Sampling Ballots in Post-Election Audits,"We present an approximate sampling framework and discuss how risk-limiting

""risk-limiting"" properties. Our framework is general and can compensate for
counting mistakes made during audits.
  Moreover, we present and analyze a simple approximate sampling
method,""$k$-cut"", for picking a ballot randomly from a stack, without counting.
Our method involves doing $k$ ""cuts"", each involving moving a random portion of
ballots from the top to the bottom of the stack, and then picking the ballot on
top. Unlike conventional methods of picking a ballot at random, $k$-cut does
not require identification numbers on the ballots or counting many ballots per
draw. We analyze how close the distribution of chosen ballots is to the uniform
distribution, and design different mitigation procedures. We show that $k=6$
cuts is enough for an risk-limiting election audit, based on empirical data,

sample from the whole population of cast ballots or requiring stratified
sampling; (3) it can start in polling places on election night, before margins

correct, a Bernoulli ballot-polling audit with a risk limit of 5% and a
sampling rate of $p_0 = 1\%$ would have had at least a 99% probability of

justifiably high confidence that the reported results of an election are
consistent with an audit trail (""ballots""), which can be paper or electronic.
SOBA combines three ideas: (1) publishing cast vote records (CVRs) separately
for each contest, so that anyone can verify that each reported contest outcome
is correct, if the CVRs reflect voters' intentions with sufficient accuracy;
(2) shrouding a mapping between ballots and the CVRs for those ballots to
prevent the loss of privacy that could occur otherwise; (3) assessing the
accuracy with which the CVRs reflect voters' intentions for a collection of
contests while simultaneously assessing the integrity of the shrouded mapping
between ballots and CVRs by comparing randomly selected ballots to the CVRs
that purport to represent them. Step (1) is related to work by the Humboldt
County Election Transparency Project, but publishing CVRs separately for
individual contests rather than images of entire ballots preserves privacy.
Step (2) requires a cryptographic commitment from elections officials.
Observers participate in step (3), which relies on the ""super-simple
simultaneous single-ballot risk-limiting audit."" Step (3) is designed to reveal
relatively few ballots if the shrouded mapping is proper and the CVRs
accurately reflect voter intent. But if the reported outcomes of the contests
differ from the outcomes that a full hand count would show, step (3) is

Recent studies (e.g., Bernhard, et al. 2020) suggest the verification rate is

of voters being unable to do so accurately or whether this is because voters
simply choose not to attempt verification in the first place. In order to
understand this problem, we conducted an experiment in which 108 participants
participated in a mock election where the BMD displayed the voters' true
choices, but then changed a subset of those choices on the printed ballot. The
design of the printed ballot, the length of the ballot, the number of changes
that were made to the ballot, the location of those changes, and the
instructions provided to the voters were manipulated as part of the experiment.
Results indicated that of those voters who chose to examine the printed ballot,
76% detected anomalies, indicating that voters can reliably detect errors on
their ballot if they will simply review it. This suggests that administrative

traditional plurality voting in which voters submit rankings over the
candidates rather than single votes. In practice, elections using IRV often
restrict the ballot length, the number of candidates a voter is allowed to rank
on their ballot. We theoretically and empirically analyze how ballot length can
influence the outcome of an election, given fixed voter preferences. We show
that there exist preference profiles over $k$ candidates such that up to $k-1$
different candidates win at different ballot lengths. We derive exact lower
bounds on the number of voters required for such profiles and provide a
construction matching the lower bound for unrestricted voter preferences.
Additionally, we characterize which sequences of winners are possible over
ballot lengths and provide explicit profile constructions achieving any
feasible winner sequence. We also examine how classic preference restrictions
influence our results--for instance, single-peakedness makes $k-1$ different
winners impossible but still allows at least $\Omega(\sqrt k)$. Finally, we
analyze a collection of 168 real-world elections, where we truncate rankings to
simulate shorter ballots. We find that shorter ballots could have changed the
outcome in one quarter of these elections. Our results highlight ballot length

the votes and choosing the top-$k$ candidates receiving the most votes. An
agent may manipulate the vote to achieve a better outcome by voting in a way
that does not reflect their true preferences. In complex and uncertain
situations, agents may use heuristics to strategize, instead of incurring the
additional effort required to compute the manipulation which most favors them.
In this paper, we examine voting behavior in multi-winner approval voting
scenarios with complete information. We show that people generally manipulate
their vote to obtain a better outcome, but often do not identify the optimal
manipulation. Instead, voters tend to prioritize the candidates with the
highest utilities. Using simulations, we demonstrate the effectiveness of these

safe, and expected manipulability. With the help of a computer program, we
identify voting scenarios in which uncertainty about the voting method may

It is well known that the US electoral college system is about 5 times more
likely to have a changed outcome due to vote corruption, when compared to a
majority vote. In fact, Mossel, O'Donnell and Oleszkiewicz proved in 2005 that
the majority voting method is most stable to this random vote corruption, among
voting methods where each person has a small influence on the election. We
discuss some recent progress on the analogous result for elections between more
than two candidates. In this case, plurality should be most stable to

substantially grown, and in response, many election officials have added new
drop boxes to their voting infrastructure. However, existing guidance for
locating drop boxes is limited. In this paper, we introduce an integer
programming model, the drop box location problem (DBLP), to locate drop boxes.
The DBLP considers criteria of cost, voter access, and risk. The cost of the
drop box system is determined by the fixed cost of adding drop boxes and the
operational cost of a collection tour by a bipartisan team who regularly
collects ballots from selected locations. The DBLP utilizes covering sets to
ensure each voter is in close proximity to a drop box and incorporates a novel

312,TRIP: Trustless Coercion-Resistant In-Person Voter Registration,"Most existing remote electronic voting systems are vulnerable to voter
coercion and vote buying. While coercion-resistant voting systems address this
challenge, current schemes assume that the voter has access to an untappable,
incorruptible device during voter registration. We present TRIP, an in-person
voter registration scheme enabling voters to create verifiable and
indistinguishable real and fake credentials using an untrusted kiosk inside a
privacy booth at a supervised location, e.g., the registrar's office. TRIP
ensures the integrity of the voter's real credential while enabling the
creation of fake credentials using interactive zero-knowledge proofs between
the voter as the verifier and the kiosk as the prover, unbeknownst to the
average voter. TRIP ensures that even voters who are under extreme coercion,
and cannot leave the booth with a real credential, can delegate their vote to a
political party, with the caveat that they must then trust the kiosk. TRIP
optimizes the tallying process by limiting the number of credentials a voter
can receive and capping the number of votes that a credential can cast per
election. We conduct a preliminary usability study among 41 participants at a
university and found that 42.5% of participants rated TRIP a B or higher in
usability, a promising result for a voter registration scheme that
substantially reduces trust in the registrar.",2202.06692v1,cs.CR,2022-02-14 13:35:46+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Louis-Henri Merino'), arxiv.Result.Author('Simone Colombo'), arxiv.Result.Author('Jeff Allen'), arxiv.Result.Author('Vero Estrada-Galiñanes'), arxiv.Result.Author('Bryan Ford')]",

actions as adding/deleting/partitioning either candidates or voters. These
actions modify an election's participation structure and aim at either making a
favorite candidate win (""constructive control"") or prevent a despised candidate
from winning (""destructive control""), which yields a total of 22 standard
control scenarios. To protect elections from such control attempts,
computational complexity has been used to show that electoral control, though
not impossible, is computationally prohibitive. Among natural voting systems
with a polynomial-time winner problem, the two systems with the highest number
of proven resistances to control types (namely 19 out of 22) are
""sincere-strategy preference-based approval voting"" (SP-AV, a modification of a
system proposed by Brams and Sanver) and fallback voting. Both are hybrid
systems; e.g., fallback voting combines approval with Bucklin voting. In this
paper, we study the control complexity of Bucklin voting itself and show that
it behaves equally well in terms of control resistance for the 20 cases

318,Measuring and mitigating voting access disparities: a study of race and polling locations in Florida and North Carolina,"Voter suppression and associated racial disparities in access to voting are
long-standing civil rights concerns in the United States. Barriers to voting
have taken many forms over the decades. A history of violent explicit
discouragement has shifted to more subtle access limitations that can include
long lines and wait times, long travel times to reach a polling station, and
other logistical barriers to voting. Our focus in this work is on quantifying
disparities in voting access pertaining to the overall time-to-vote, and how
they could be remedied via a better choice of polling location or provisioning
more sites where voters can cast ballots. However, appropriately calibrating
access disparities is difficult because of the need to account for factors such
as population density and different community expectations for reasonable
travel times.
  In this paper, we quantify access to polling locations, developing a
methodology for the calibrated measurement of racial disparities in polling
location ""load"" and distance to polling locations. We apply this methodology to
a study of real-world data from Florida and North Carolina to identify
disparities in voting access from the 2020 election. We also introduce
algorithms, with modifications to handle scale, that can reduce these
disparities by suggesting new polling locations from a given list of identified
public locations (including schools and libraries). Applying these algorithms
on the 2020 election location data also helps to expose and explore tradeoffs
between the cost of allocating more polling locations and the potential impact
on access disparities. The developed voting access measurement methodology and
algorithmic remediation technique is a first step in better polling location

320,Non(c)esuch Ballot-Level Risk-Limiting Audits for Precinct-Count Voting Systems,"Risk-limiting audits (RLAs) guarantee a high probability of correcting
incorrect reported outcomes before the outcomes are certified. The most
efficient use ballot-level comparison, comparing the voting system's
interpretation of individual ballot cards sampled at random (cast-vote records,
CVRs) from a trustworthy paper trail to a human interpretation of the same
cards. Such comparisons require the voting system to create and export CVRs in
a way that can be linked to the individual ballots the CVRs purport to
represent. Such links can be created by keeping the ballots in the order in
which they are scanned or by printing a unique serial number on each ballot.
But for precinct-count systems (PCOS), these strategies may compromise vote
anonymity: the order in which ballots are cast may identify the voters who cast
them. Printing a unique pseudo-random number (""cryptographic nonce"") on each
ballot card after the voter last touches it could reduce such privacy risks.
But what if the system does not in fact print a unique number on each ballot or
does not accurately report the numbers it printed? This paper gives two ways to
conduct an RLA so that even if the system does not print a genuine nonce on
each ballot or misreports the nonces it used, the audit's risk limit is not
compromised (however, the anonymity of votes might be compromised). One method
allows untrusted technology to be used to imprint and to retrieve ballot cards.
The method is adaptive: if the technology behaves properly, this protection
does not increase the audit workload. But if the imprinting or retrieval system
misbehaves, the sample size the RLA requires to confirm the reported results
when the results are correct is generally larger than if the imprinting and
retrieval were accurate.",2207.01362v1,cs.CR,2022-07-04 12:35:42+00:00,[arxiv.Result.Author('Philip B. Stark')],

Referendum celebrated in Venezuela on August 15, 2004. We define fraud as the
difference between the elector's intent, and the official vote tally. Our null
hypothesis is that there was no fraud, and we attempt to search for evidence
that will allow us to reject this hypothesis. We find no evidence that fraud
was committed by applying numerical maximums to machines in some precincts.
Equally, we discard any hypothesis that implies altering some machines and not
others, at each electoral precinct, because the variation patterns between
machines at each precinct are normal. However, the statistical evidence is
compatible with the occurrence of fraud that has affected every machine in a
single precinct, but differentially more in some precincts than others. We find
that the deviation pattern between precincts, based on the relationship between
the signatures collected to request the referendum in November 2003 (the
so-called, Reafirmazo), and the YES votes on August 15, is positive and
significantly correlated with the deviation pattern in the relationship between
exit polls and votes in those same precincts. In other words, those precincts
in which, according to the number of signatures, there are an unusually low
number of YES votes (i.e., votes to impeach the president), is also where,
according to the exit polls, the same thing occurs.",1205.3921v1,stat.ME,2012-05-17 12:52:40+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Ricardo Hausmann'), arxiv.Result.Author('Roberto Rigobon')]","Statistical Science 2011, Vol. 26, No. 4, 543-563"
323,Conservative statistical post-election audits,"There are many sources of error in counting votes: the apparent winner might
not be the rightful winner. Hand tallies of the votes in a random sample of
precincts can be used to test the hypothesis that a full manual recount would
find a different outcome. This paper develops a conservative sequential test
based on the vote-counting errors found in a hand tally of a simple or
stratified random sample of precincts. The procedure includes a natural
escalation: If the hypothesis that the apparent outcome is incorrect is not
rejected at stage $s$, more precincts are audited. Eventually, either the
hypothesis is rejected--and the apparent outcome is confirmed--or all precincts
have been audited and the true outcome is known. The test uses a priori bounds
on the overstatement of the margin that could result from error in each
precinct. Such bounds can be derived from the reported counts in each precinct
and upper bounds on the number of votes cast in each precinct. The test allows
errors in different precincts to be treated differently to reflect voting
technology or precinct sizes. It is not optimal, but it is conservative: the
chance of erroneously confirming the outcome of a contest if a full manual
recount would show a different outcome is no larger than the nominal
significance level. The approach also gives a conservative $P$-value for the
hypothesis that a full manual recount would find a different outcome, given the
errors found in a fixed size sample. This is illustrated with two contests from
November, 2006: the U.S. Senate race in Minnesota and a school board race for
the Sausalito Marin City School District in California, a small contest in
which voters could vote for up to three candidates.",0807.4005v1,stat.AP,2008-07-25 06:54:40+00:00,[arxiv.Result.Author('Philip B. Stark')],"Annals of Applied Statistics 2008, Vol. 2, No. 2, 550-581"
324,Limiting Risk by Turning Manifest Phantoms into Evil Zombies,"Drawing a random sample of ballots to conduct a risk-limiting audit generally
requires knowing how the ballots cast in an election are organized into groups,
for instance, how many containers of ballots there are in all and how many
ballots are in each container. A list of the ballot group identifiers along
with number of ballots in each group is called a ballot manifest. What if the
ballot manifest is not accurate? Surprisingly, even if ballots are known to be
missing from the manifest, it is not necessary to make worst-case assumptions
about those ballots--for instance, to adjust the margin by the number of
missing ballots--to ensure that the audit remains conservative. Rather, it
suffices to make worst-case assumptions about the individual randomly selected
ballots that the audit cannot find. This observation provides a simple
modification to some risk-limiting audit procedures that makes them
automatically become more conservative if the ballot manifest has errors. The
modification--phantoms to evil zombies (~2EZ)--requires only an upper bound on
the total number of ballots cast. ~2EZ makes the audit P-value stochastically
larger than it would be had the manifest been accurate, automatically requiring
more than enough ballots to be audited to offset the manifest errors. This
ensures that the true risk limit remains smaller than the nominal risk limit.
On the other hand, if the manifest is in fact accurate and the upper bound on
the total number of ballots equals the total according to the manifest, ~2EZ
has no effect at all on the number of ballots audited nor on the true risk
limit.",1207.3413v1,stat.AP,2012-07-14 11:26:02+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Jorge H. Banuelos'), arxiv.Result.Author('Philip B. Stark')]",

arrest rates. The standard GeoRDD relies on continuity assumptions of the
potential outcome surface or a local randomization assumption within a window
around the boundary. These assumptions, however, can easily be violated in
realistic applications. We develop a novel and robust approach to testing
whether there are differences in policing outcomes that are caused by
differences in police precincts across NYC. In particular, our test is robust
to violations of the assumptions traditionally made in GeoRDDs and is valid
under much weaker assumptions. We use a unique form of resampling to identify
new geographic boundaries that are known to have no treatment effect, which
provides a valid estimate of our test statistic's null distribution even under
violations of standard assumptions. This procedure gives substantially
different results in the analysis of NYC arrest rates than those that rely on
standard assumptions, thereby providing more robust tests of the effect of
police precincts on arrest rates in NYC.",2106.16124v3,stat.ME,2021-06-30 15:20:46+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Emmett B. Kendall'), arxiv.Result.Author('Brenden Beck'), arxiv.Result.Author('Joseph Antonelli')]",

real ballots of any strict subset of districts at a price corresponding to the
willingness to sell on the part of the citizens holding such ballots. By
contrast, decoy voters are trapped into selling their ballots at a low, or even
negligible, price. Blowing up the adversary's budget by introducing decoy

330,The ATHENA Class of Risk-Limiting Ballot Polling Audits,"The main risk-limiting ballot polling audit in use today, BRAVO, is designed
for use when single ballots are drawn at random and a decision regarding
whether to stop the audit or draw another ballot is taken after each ballot
draw (ballot-by-ballot (B2) audits). On the other hand, real ballot polling
audits draw many ballots in a single round before determining whether to stop
(round-by-round (R2) audits). We show that BRAVO results in significant
inefficiency when directly applied to real R2 audits. We present the ATHENA
class of R2 stopping rules, which we show are risk-limiting if the round
schedule is pre-determined (before the audit begins). We prove that each rule
is at least as efficient as the corresponding BRAVO stopping rule applied at
the end of the round. We have open-source software libraries implementing most
of our results.
  We show that ATHENA halves the number of ballots required, for all state
margins in the 2016 US Presidential election and a first round with $90\%$
stopping probability, when compared to BRAVO (stopping rule applied at the end
of the round). We present simulation results supporting the 90% stopping
probability claims and our claims for the risk accrued in the first round.
Further, ATHENA reduces the number of ballots by more than a quarter for low
margins, when compared to the BRAVO stopping rule applied on ballots in
selection order. This implies that keeping track of the order when drawing
ballots R2 is not beneficial, because ATHENA is more efficient even without
information on selection order. These results are significant because current
approaches to real ballot polling election audits use the B2 BRAVO rules,
requiring about twice as much work on the part of election officials. Applying
the rules in selection order requires fewer ballots, but keeping track of the
order, and entering it into audit software, adds to the effort.",2008.02315v5,cs.CR,2020-08-05 18:47:37+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Filip Zagórski'), arxiv.Result.Author('Grant McClearn'), arxiv.Result.Author('Sarah Morin'), arxiv.Result.Author('Neal McBurnett'), arxiv.Result.Author('Poorvi L.

justifiably high confidence that the reported results of an election are

SOBA combines three ideas: (1) publishing cast vote records (CVRs) separately
for each contest, so that anyone can verify that each reported contest outcome
is correct, if the CVRs reflect voters' intentions with sufficient accuracy;
(2) shrouding a mapping between ballots and the CVRs for those ballots to
prevent the loss of privacy that could occur otherwise; (3) assessing the
accuracy with which the CVRs reflect voters' intentions for a collection of
contests while simultaneously assessing the integrity of the shrouded mapping
between ballots and CVRs by comparing randomly selected ballots to the CVRs
that purport to represent them. Step (1) is related to work by the Humboldt
County Election Transparency Project, but publishing CVRs separately for
individual contests rather than images of entire ballots preserves privacy.
Step (2) requires a cryptographic commitment from elections officials.
Observers participate in step (3), which relies on the ""super-simple

relatively few ballots if the shrouded mapping is proper and the CVRs
accurately reflect voter intent. But if the reported outcomes of the contests

333,"Voter Verification of BMD Ballots Is a Two-Part Question: Can They? Mostly, They Can. Do They? Mostly, They Don't","The question of whether or not voters actually verify ballots produced by
ballot marking devices (BMDs) is presently the subject of some controversy.
Recent studies (e.g., Bernhard, et al. 2020) suggest the verification rate is
low. What is not clear from previous research is whether this is more a result
of voters being unable to do so accurately or whether this is because voters
simply choose not to attempt verification in the first place. In order to
understand this problem, we conducted an experiment in which 108 participants
participated in a mock election where the BMD displayed the voters' true
choices, but then changed a subset of those choices on the printed ballot. The
design of the printed ballot, the length of the ballot, the number of changes
that were made to the ballot, the location of those changes, and the
instructions provided to the voters were manipulated as part of the experiment.
Results indicated that of those voters who chose to examine the printed ballot,

341,Limiting Risk by Turning Manifest Phantoms into Evil Zombies,"Drawing a random sample of ballots to conduct a risk-limiting audit generally
requires knowing how the ballots cast in an election are organized into groups,
for instance, how many containers of ballots there are in all and how many
ballots are in each container. A list of the ballot group identifiers along
with number of ballots in each group is called a ballot manifest. What if the
ballot manifest is not accurate? Surprisingly, even if ballots are known to be
missing from the manifest, it is not necessary to make worst-case assumptions
about those ballots--for instance, to adjust the margin by the number of
missing ballots--to ensure that the audit remains conservative. Rather, it
suffices to make worst-case assumptions about the individual randomly selected
ballots that the audit cannot find. This observation provides a simple
modification to some risk-limiting audit procedures that makes them
automatically become more conservative if the ballot manifest has errors. The
modification--phantoms to evil zombies (~2EZ)--requires only an upper bound on
the total number of ballots cast. ~2EZ makes the audit P-value stochastically
larger than it would be had the manifest been accurate, automatically requiring
more than enough ballots to be audited to offset the manifest errors. This
ensures that the true risk limit remains smaller than the nominal risk limit.
On the other hand, if the manifest is in fact accurate and the upper bound on
the total number of ballots equals the total according to the manifest, ~2EZ
has no effect at all on the number of ballots audited nor on the true risk
limit.",1207.3413v1,stat.AP,2012-07-14 11:26:02+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Jorge H. Banuelos'), arxiv.Result.Author('Philip B. Stark')]",

malevolent adversary trying to buy real ballots. If the citizenry is divided
into subgroups (or districts), the adversary can construct a so-called ""Devil's
Menu"" consisting of several prices. In equilibrium, the adversary can buy the
real ballots of any strict subset of districts at a price corresponding to the
willingness to sell on the part of the citizens holding such ballots. By
contrast, decoy voters are trapped into selling their ballots at a low, or even
negligible, price. Blowing up the adversary's budget by introducing decoy
ballots may thus turn out to be futile. The Devil's Menu can also be applied to
the well-known ""Lemons Problem"".",1712.05477v1,cs.GT,2017-12-14 23:54:58+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Hans Gersbach'), arxiv.Result.Author('Akaki Mamageishvili'), arxiv.Result.Author('Oriol Tejada')]",
344,The ATHENA Class of Risk-Limiting Ballot Polling Audits,"The main risk-limiting ballot polling audit in use today, BRAVO, is designed
for use when single ballots are drawn at random and a decision regarding
whether to stop the audit or draw another ballot is taken after each ballot
draw (ballot-by-ballot (B2) audits). On the other hand, real ballot polling
audits draw many ballots in a single round before determining whether to stop
(round-by-round (R2) audits). We show that BRAVO results in significant
inefficiency when directly applied to real R2 audits. We present the ATHENA
class of R2 stopping rules, which we show are risk-limiting if the round
schedule is pre-determined (before the audit begins). We prove that each rule
is at least as efficient as the corresponding BRAVO stopping rule applied at
the end of the round. We have open-source software libraries implementing most
of our results.
  We show that ATHENA halves the number of ballots required, for all state
margins in the 2016 US Presidential election and a first round with $90\%$
stopping probability, when compared to BRAVO (stopping rule applied at the end
of the round). We present simulation results supporting the 90% stopping
probability claims and our claims for the risk accrued in the first round.
Further, ATHENA reduces the number of ballots by more than a quarter for low
margins, when compared to the BRAVO stopping rule applied on ballots in
selection order. This implies that keeping track of the order when drawing
ballots R2 is not beneficial, because ATHENA is more efficient even without
information on selection order. These results are significant because current
approaches to real ballot polling election audits use the B2 BRAVO rules,
requiring about twice as much work on the part of election officials. Applying
the rules in selection order requires fewer ballots, but keeping track of the
order, and entering it into audit software, adds to the effort.",2008.02315v5,cs.CR,2020-08-05 18:47:37+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Filip Zagórski'), arxiv.Result.Author('Grant McClearn'), arxiv.Result.Author('Sarah Morin'), arxiv.Result.Author('Neal McBurnett'), arxiv.Result.Author('Poorvi L.

ballot tilings form a subset in the set of symmetric Dyck tilings, we construct
an inclusive map from labeled trees for ballot tilings to labeled trees for

tilings can be applied to those of ballot tilings. We introduce and study the

justifiably high confidence that the reported results of an election are
consistent with an audit trail (""ballots""), which can be paper or electronic.
SOBA combines three ideas: (1) publishing cast vote records (CVRs) separately
for each contest, so that anyone can verify that each reported contest outcome
is correct, if the CVRs reflect voters' intentions with sufficient accuracy;
(2) shrouding a mapping between ballots and the CVRs for those ballots to
prevent the loss of privacy that could occur otherwise; (3) assessing the
accuracy with which the CVRs reflect voters' intentions for a collection of
contests while simultaneously assessing the integrity of the shrouded mapping
between ballots and CVRs by comparing randomly selected ballots to the CVRs
that purport to represent them. Step (1) is related to work by the Humboldt
County Election Transparency Project, but publishing CVRs separately for
individual contests rather than images of entire ballots preserves privacy.
Step (2) requires a cryptographic commitment from elections officials.
Observers participate in step (3), which relies on the ""super-simple
simultaneous single-ballot risk-limiting audit."" Step (3) is designed to reveal
relatively few ballots if the shrouded mapping is proper and the CVRs
accurately reflect voter intent. But if the reported outcomes of the contests
differ from the outcomes that a full hand count would show, step (3) is
guaranteed to have a large chance of requiring all the ballots to be counted by
hand, thereby limiting the risk that an incorrect outcome will become official

Recent studies (e.g., Bernhard, et al. 2020) suggest the verification rate is
low. What is not clear from previous research is whether this is more a result
of voters being unable to do so accurately or whether this is because voters
simply choose not to attempt verification in the first place. In order to
understand this problem, we conducted an experiment in which 108 participants
participated in a mock election where the BMD displayed the voters' true
choices, but then changed a subset of those choices on the printed ballot. The
design of the printed ballot, the length of the ballot, the number of changes
that were made to the ballot, the location of those changes, and the
instructions provided to the voters were manipulated as part of the experiment.
Results indicated that of those voters who chose to examine the printed ballot,
76% detected anomalies, indicating that voters can reliably detect errors on

elections, a common approach to deciding multi-seat elections. It is usually
expected that random errors should have nearly equal effects on all candidates,
and thus be fair. We find to the contrary that random errors can introduce
systematic bias into election results. This is because, even if the errors are
random, votes for different candidates occur in different patterns that are
affected differently by random errors. In the STV context, the most important
effect of random errors is to invalidate the ballot. This removes far more
votes for those candidates whose supporters tend to list a lot of preferences,
because their ballots are much more likely to be invalidated by random error.
Different validity rules for different voting styles mean that errors are much
more likely to penalise some types of votes than others. For close elections
this systematic bias can change the result of the election.",2007.00854v3,cs.CY,2020-07-02 03:37:48+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Michelle Blom'), arxiv.Result.Author('Andrew Conway'), arxiv.Result.Author('Peter J.

349,"They may look and look, yet not see: BMDs cannot be tested adequately","Bugs, misconfiguration, and malware can cause ballot-marking devices (BMDs)
to print incorrect votes. Several approaches to testing BMDs have been
proposed. In logic and accuracy testing (LAT) and parallel or live testing,
auditors input known test votes into the BMD and check the printout. Passive
testing monitors the rate of ""spoiled"" BMD printout, on the theory that if BMDs
malfunction, the rate will increase noticeably. We show that these approaches
cannot reliably detect outcome-altering problems, because: (i) The number of
possible interactions with BMDs is enormous, so testing interactions uniformly
at random is hopeless. (ii) To probe the space of interactions intelligently
requires an accurate model of voter behavior, but because the space of
interactions is so large, building an accurate model requires observing a huge
number of voters in every jurisdiction in every election--more voters than
there are in most jurisdictions. (iii) Even with a perfect model of voter
behavior, the number of tests needed exceeds the number of voters in most
jurisdictions. (iv) An attacker can target interactions that are expensive to
test, e.g., because they involve voting slowly; or interactions for which
tampering is less likely to be noticed, e.g., because the voter uses the audio
interface. (v) Whether BMDs misbehave or not, the distribution of spoiled
ballots is unknown and varies by election and possibly by ballot style:
historical data do not help much. Hence, there is no way to calibrate a
threshold for passive testing, e.g., to guarantee at least a 95% chance of
noticing that 5% of the votes were altered, with at most a 5% false alarm rate.
(vi) Even if the distribution of spoiled ballots were known to be Poisson, the
vast majority of jurisdictions do not have enough voters for passive testing to

alarms.",1908.08144v4,stat.AP,2019-08-21 23:39:04+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Philip B. Stark'), arxiv.Result.Author('Ran Xie')]",

352,Sets of Half-Average Nulls Generate Risk-Limiting Audits: SHANGRLA,"Risk-limiting audits (RLAs) for many social choice functions can be reduced
to testing sets of null hypotheses of the form ""the average of this list is not

social choice functions include majority, super-majority, plurality,
multi-winner plurality, Instant Runoff Voting (IRV), Borda count, approval
voting, and STAR-Voting, among others. The audit stops without a full hand
count iff all the null hypotheses are rejected. The nulls can be tested in many
ways. Ballot-polling is particularly simple; two new ballot-polling
risk-measuring functions for sampling without replacement are given.
Ballot-level comparison audits transform each null into an equivalent assertion
that the mean of re-scaled tabulation errors is not greater than 1/2. In turn,
that null can then be tested using the same statistical methods used for ballot
polling---but applied to different finite lists of nonnegative numbers.
SHANGRLA comparison audits are more efficient than previous comparison audits
for two reasons: (i) for most social choice functions, the conditions tested
are both necessary and sufficient for the reported outcome to be correct, while
previous methods tested conditions that were sufficient but not necessary, and
(ii) the tests avoid a conservative approximation. The SHANGRLA abstraction
simplifies stratified audits, including audits that combine ballot polling with
ballot-level comparisons, producing sharper audits than the ""SUITE"" approach.
SHANGRLA works with the ""phantoms to evil zombies"" strategy to treat missing
ballot cards and missing or redacted cast vote records. That also facilitates
sampling from ""ballot-style manifests,"" which can dramatically improve
efficiency when the audited contests do not appear on every ballot card.

interpretation of individual ballot cards sampled at random (cast-vote records,
CVRs) from a trustworthy paper trail to a human interpretation of the same

a way that can be linked to the individual ballots the CVRs purport to
represent. Such links can be created by keeping the ballots in the order in
which they are scanned or by printing a unique serial number on each ballot.
But for precinct-count systems (PCOS), these strategies may compromise vote
anonymity: the order in which ballots are cast may identify the voters who cast
them. Printing a unique pseudo-random number (""cryptographic nonce"") on each
ballot card after the voter last touches it could reduce such privacy risks.
But what if the system does not in fact print a unique number on each ballot or

conduct an RLA so that even if the system does not print a genuine nonce on
each ballot or misreports the nonces it used, the audit's risk limit is not

justification is here provided by a proportion of ballots, which are
quasi-choices rationalizable by an arbitrary binary relation. We call a
quasi-choice $s$-majoritarian if all options selected from a menu are endorsed
by a share of ballots larger than $s$. We prove that all forms of
majoritarianism are equivalent to a well-known behavioral property, namely
Chernoff axiom. Then we focus on two paradigms of majoritarianism, whereby
either a simple majority of ballots justifies a quasi-choice, or the
endorsement by a single ballot suffices - a liberal justification. These
benchmark explanations typically require a different minimum number of ballots.
We determine the asymptotic minimum size of a liberal justification.",2210.16885v1,econ.TH,2022-10-30 16:50:24+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('José Carlos R. Alcantud'), arxiv.Result.Author('Domenico Cantone'), arxiv.Result.Author('Alfio Giarlotta'), arxiv.Result.Author('Stephen Watson')]",

even the most carefully designed systems necessarily leak information via the
announced result. In corner cases, this may be problematic. For example, if all
the votes go to one candidate then all vote privacy evaporates. The mere
possibility of candidates getting no or few votes could have implications for
security in practice: if a coercer demands that a voter cast a vote for such an
unpopular candidate, then the voter may feel obliged to obey, even if she is
confident that the voting system satisfies the standard coercion resistance
definitions. With complex ballots, there may also be a danger of ""Italian""
style (aka ""signature"") attacks: the coercer demands the voter cast a ballot
with a specific, identifying pattern. Here we propose an approach to tallying
end-to-end verifiable schemes that avoids revealing all the votes but still
achieves whatever confidence level in the announced result is desired. Now a
coerced voter can claim that the required vote must be amongst those that
remained shrouded. Our approach is based on the well-established notion of
Risk-Limiting Audits, but here applied to the tally rather than to the audit.
We show that this approach counters coercion threats arising in extreme tallies

attack where fake ballots (not cast by any eligible voter) are inserted into

actually cast their vote. So far, the combination of ballot stuffing and
participation privacy has been mostly studied for internet voting, where voters
are assumed to own trusted computing devices. Such approaches are inapplicable
to pollsite voting where voters typically vote bare handed. We present an
eligibility audit protocol to detect ballot stuffing in pollsite voting
protocols. This is done while protecting participation privacy from a remote
observer - one who does not physically observe voters during voting. Our
protocol can be instantiated as an additional layer on top of most existing
pollsite E2E-V voting protocols. To achieve our guarantees, we develop an
efficient zero-knowledge proof (ZKP), that, given a value $v$ and a set $\Phi$
of commitments, proves $v$ is committed by some commitment in $\Phi$, without
revealing which one. We call this a ZKP of reverse set membership because of
its relationship to the popular ZKPs of set membership. This ZKP may be of

influence the outcome of an election, given fixed voter preferences. We show
that there exist preference profiles over $k$ candidates such that up to $k-1$
different candidates win at different ballot lengths. We derive exact lower
bounds on the number of voters required for such profiles and provide a
construction matching the lower bound for unrestricted voter preferences.
Additionally, we characterize which sequences of winners are possible over
ballot lengths and provide explicit profile constructions achieving any
feasible winner sequence. We also examine how classic preference restrictions
influence our results--for instance, single-peakedness makes $k-1$ different
winners impossible but still allows at least $\Omega(\sqrt k)$. Finally, we
analyze a collection of 168 real-world elections, where we truncate rankings to
simulate shorter ballots. We find that shorter ballots could have changed the

364,How long is a piece of string? An exploration of multi-winner approval voting and ballot-length restrictions,"Multi-winner approval elections are seen in a variety of settings ranging
from academic societies and associations to public elections. In such
elections, it is often the case that ballot-length restrictions are enforced;
that is, where voters have a limit on the number of candidates which they can
vote for. Despite this common feature, there does not seem to be any
theoretical justification for ballot-length restrictions (Laslier and Van der
Straeten, 2016).
  This work endogenously derives the set of voter best-response ballot lengths
under complete information and with general assumptions on voter utilities and
voting rules. These results provide justification for some ballot-length
restrictions observed in practice, however when considering equilibrium
outcomes our analysis shows that this justification is no longer valid.
Equilibrium analysis is considered for voters with lazy and truth-bias
second-order tendencies and the equilibrium solution concept is pure-Nash
equilibria.
  The key insights show that ballot-length restrictions or institutional
features which make voting costly may lead to instability in election outcomes
when voters have diverse preferences, via the non-existence of equilibria. On
the other hand, when equilibria do exist they satisfy desirable properties
which are not guaranteed by equilibria attained under costless voting and in
the absence of ballot-length restrictions. In summary our results highlight a
stark trade-off between stable and desirable election outcomes.",1711.05092v1,cs.GT,2017-11-14 14:12:57+00:00,[arxiv.Result.Author('Barton E. Lee')],

initial exploration of boardroom elections with ballot privacy and voter
verifiability that use only ""low-tech cryptography"" without using computers to
mark or collect ballots. Specifically, we define the problem, introduce several
building blocks, and propose a new protocol that combines these blocks in novel
ways. Our new building blocks include ""foldable ballots"" that can be rotated to
hide the alignment of ballot choices with voting marks, and ""visual secrets""
that are easy to remember and use but hard to describe. Although closely seated
participants in a boardroom election have limited privacy, the protocol ensures
that no one can determine how others voted. Moreover, each voter can verify
that their ballot was correctly cast, collected, and counted, without being
able to prove how they voted, providing assurance against undue influence.
Low-tech cryptography is useful in situations where constituents do not trust
computer technology, and it avoids the complex auditing requirements of
end-to-end cryptographic voting systems such as Pr\^{e}t-\`{a}-Voter. This

selections on a BMD. We then required them to examine their ballots for any
changes from the slate they used to vote. Overall accuracy was exceptionally
high. Participants saw 1440 total contests, and of those 1440, there were a
total of 4 errors, so total accuracy was 99.8%. Participants were able to
perform with near-perfect accuracy regardless of ballot length, ballot type,
number of altered races, and location of altered races. Detection performance
was extremely robust. We conclude that with proper direction and resources,
voters can be near-perfect detectors of ballot changes on printed paper ballots

governed by order-based voting rules. Our protocol offers perfect ballot
secrecy, in the sense that it issues only the required output, while no other
information on the cast ballots is revealed. Such perfect secrecy, which is
achieved by employing secure multiparty computation tools, may increase the
voters' confidence and, consequently, encourage them to vote according to their
true preferences. Evaluation of the protocol's computational costs establishes

369,"More style, less work: card-style data decrease risk-limiting audit sample sizes","U.S. elections rely heavily on computers such as voter registration
databases, electronic pollbooks, voting machines, scanners, tabulators, and
results reporting websites. These introduce digital threats to election
outcomes. Risk-limiting audits (RLAs) mitigate threats to some of these systems
by manually inspecting random samples of ballot cards. RLAs have a large chance
of correcting wrong outcomes (by conducting a full manual tabulation of a
trustworthy record of the votes), but can save labor when reported outcomes are
correct. This efficiency is eroded when sampling cannot be targeted to ballot
cards that contain the contest(s) under audit. If the sample is drawn from all
cast cards, RLA sample sizes scale like the reciprocal of the fraction of
ballot cards that contain the contest(s) under audit. That fraction shrinks as
the number of cards per ballot grows (i.e., when elections contain more
contests) and as the fraction of ballots that contain the contest decreases
(i.e., when a smaller percentage of voters are eligible to vote in the
contest). States that conduct RLAs of contests on multi-card ballots or of
small contests can dramatically reduce sample sizes by using information about
which ballot cards contain which contests -- by keeping track of card-style
data (CSD). For instance, CSD reduces the expected number of draws needed to
audit a single countywide contest on a 4-card ballot by 75%. Similarly, CSD
reduces the expected number of draws by 95% or more for an audit of two
contests with the same margin on a 4-card ballot if one contest is on every
ballot and the other is on 10% of ballots. In realistic examples, the savings
can be several orders of magnitude.",2012.03371v1,cs.CR,2020-12-06 20:35:12+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Amanda K. Glazer'), arxiv.Result.Author('Jacob V. Spertus'), arxiv.Result.Author('Philip B. Stark')]",

pairs and a tally of the votes, organized to help visualize how the votes add
up. After the polls close, each voter verifies that this table lists their
(P,V) pair and that the tally is computed correctly. The system is especially
appropriate for any small group making sensitive decisions. Because the system

passphrase, it is not designed for applications where such malfeasance would be

378,BVOT: Self-Tallying Boardroom Voting with Oblivious Transfer,"A boardroom election is an election with a small number of voters carried out
with public communications. We present BVOT, a self-tallying boardroom voting
protocol with ballot secrecy, fairness (no tally information is available
before the polls close), and dispute-freeness (voters can observe that all
voters correctly followed the protocol).
  BVOT works by using a multiparty threshold homomorphic encryption system in
which each candidate is associated with a masked unique prime. Each voter
engages in an oblivious transfer with an untrusted distributor: the voter
selects the index of a prime associated with a candidate and receives the
selected prime in masked form. The voter then casts their vote by encrypting
their masked prime and broadcasting it to everyone. The distributor does not
learn the voter's choice, and no one learns the mapping between primes and
candidates until the audit phase. By hiding the mapping between primes and
candidates, BVOT provides voters with insufficient information to carry out
effective cheating. The threshold feature prevents anyone from computing any
partial tally---until everyone has voted. Multiplying all votes, their
decryption shares, and the unmasking factor yields a product of the primes each
raised to the number of votes received.
  In contrast to some existing boardroom voting protocols, BVOT does not rely
on any zero-knowledge proof; instead, it uses oblivious transfer to assure
ballot secrecy and correct vote casting. Also, BVOT can handle multiple
candidates in one election. BVOT prevents cheating by hiding crucial
information: an attempt to increase the tally of one candidate might increase
the tally of another candidate. After all votes are cast, any party can tally
the votes.",2010.02421v1,cs.CR,2020-10-06 01:28:34+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Farid Javani'), arxiv.Result.Author('Alan T. Sherman')]",
379,Modeling Voters in Multi-Winner Approval Voting,"In many real world situations, collective decisions are made using voting
and, in scenarios such as committee or board elections, employing voting rules
that return multiple winners. In multi-winner approval voting (AV), an agent
submits a ballot consisting of approvals for as many candidates as they wish,
and winners are chosen by tallying up the votes and choosing the top-$k$
candidates receiving the most approvals. In many scenarios, an agent may
manipulate the ballot they submit in order to achieve a better outcome by
voting in a way that does not reflect their true preferences. In complex and
uncertain situations, agents may use heuristics instead of incurring the
additional effort required to compute the manipulation which most favors them.
In this paper, we examine voting behavior in single-winner and multi-winner
approval voting scenarios with varying degrees of uncertainty using behavioral
data obtained from Mechanical Turk. We find that people generally manipulate
their vote to obtain a better outcome, but often do not identify the optimal
manipulation. There are a number of predictive models of agent behavior in the
COMSOC and psychology literature that are based on cognitively plausible
heuristic strategies. We show that the existing approaches do not adequately
model real-world data. We propose a novel model that takes into account the
size of the winning set and human cognitive constraints, and demonstrate that

380,Benaloh's Dense Probabilistic Encryption Revisited,"In 1994, Josh Benaloh proposed a probabilistic homomorphic encryption scheme,
enhancing the poor expansion factor provided by Goldwasser and Micali's scheme.
Since then, numerous papers have taken advantage of Benaloh's homomorphic
encryption function, including voting schemes, computing multi-party trust
privately, non-interactive verifiable secret sharing, online poker... In this
paper we show that the original description of the scheme is incorrect,
possibly resulting in ambiguous decryption of ciphertexts. We give a corrected
description of the scheme and provide a complete proof of correctness. We also
compute the probability of failure of the original scheme. Finally we analyze
several applications using Benaloh's encryption scheme. We show in each case
the impact of a bad choice in the key generation phase of Benaloh's scheme. For
instance in the application of e-voting protocol, it can inverse the result of
an election, which is a non negligible consequence.",1008.2991v3,cs.CR,2010-08-18 00:45:27+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Laurent Fousse'), arxiv.Result.Author('Pascal Lafourcade'), arxiv.Result.Author('Mohamed Alnuaimi')]",

challenging combination of security and privacy requirements. The stakes are
high; the context is adversarial; the electorate needs to be convinced that the
results are correct; and the secrecy of the ballot must be ensured. And they
have practical constraints: time is of the essence, and voting systems need to
be affordable and maintainable, and usable by voters, election officials, and
pollworkers. It is thus not surprising that voting is a rich research area
spanning theory, applied cryptography, practical systems analysis, usable
security, and statistics. Election integrity involves two key concepts:
convincing evidence that outcomes are correct and privacy, which amounts to
convincing assurance that there is no evidence about how any given person
voted. These are obviously in tension. We examine how current systems walk this

justifiably high confidence that the reported results of an election are
consistent with an audit trail (""ballots""), which can be paper or electronic.
SOBA combines three ideas: (1) publishing cast vote records (CVRs) separately
for each contest, so that anyone can verify that each reported contest outcome
is correct, if the CVRs reflect voters' intentions with sufficient accuracy;
(2) shrouding a mapping between ballots and the CVRs for those ballots to
prevent the loss of privacy that could occur otherwise; (3) assessing the
accuracy with which the CVRs reflect voters' intentions for a collection of
contests while simultaneously assessing the integrity of the shrouded mapping
between ballots and CVRs by comparing randomly selected ballots to the CVRs
that purport to represent them. Step (1) is related to work by the Humboldt
County Election Transparency Project, but publishing CVRs separately for
individual contests rather than images of entire ballots preserves privacy.
Step (2) requires a cryptographic commitment from elections officials.
Observers participate in step (3), which relies on the ""super-simple
simultaneous single-ballot risk-limiting audit."" Step (3) is designed to reveal
relatively few ballots if the shrouded mapping is proper and the CVRs
accurately reflect voter intent. But if the reported outcomes of the contests
differ from the outcomes that a full hand count would show, step (3) is
guaranteed to have a large chance of requiring all the ballots to be counted by
hand, thereby limiting the risk that an incorrect outcome will become official

385,Bugs in our Pockets: The Risks of Client-Side Scanning,"Our increasing reliance on digital technology for personal, economic, and
government affairs has made it essential to secure the communications and
devices of private citizens, businesses, and governments. This has led to
pervasive use of cryptography across society. Despite its evident advantages,
law enforcement and national security agencies have argued that the spread of
cryptography has hindered access to evidence and intelligence. Some in industry
and government now advocate a new technology to access targeted data:
client-side scanning (CSS). Instead of weakening encryption or providing law
enforcement with backdoor keys to decrypt communications, CSS would enable
on-device analysis of data in the clear. If targeted information were detected,
its existence and, potentially, its source, would be revealed to the agencies;
otherwise, little or no information would leave the client device. Its
proponents claim that CSS is a solution to the encryption versus public safety
debate: it offers privacy -- in the sense of unimpeded end-to-end encryption --
and the ability to successfully investigate serious crime. In this report, we
argue that CSS neither guarantees efficacious crime prevention nor prevents
surveillance. Indeed, the effect is the opposite. CSS by its nature creates
serious security and privacy risks for all society while the assistance it can
provide for law enforcement is at best problematic. There are multiple ways in
which client-side scanning can fail, can be evaded, and can be abused.",2110.07450v1,cs.CR,2021-10-14 15:18:49+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Hal Abelson'), arxiv.Result.Author('Ross Anderson'), arxiv.Result.Author('Steven M.

image analysis, based on statistical principles from quantitative and
qualitative experimental research. We identify two types of challenges based on
their generalization objective: 1) a deployment challenge and 2) an insight
challenge. A deployment challenge's generalization objective is to find
algorithms that solve a medical image analysis problem, which thereby requires
the use of a quantitative experimental design. An insight challenge's
generalization objective is to gain a broad understanding of what class of
algorithms might be effective for a class of medical image analysis problems,
in which case a qualitative experimental design is sufficient. Both challenge
types are valuable, but problems arise when a challenge's design and objective
are inconsistent, as is often the case when a challenge does not carefully
consider these concepts. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a theoretical
framework, based on statistical principles, to guide researchers in challenge
design, documentation, and assessment. Experimental results are given that
explore the factors that effect the practical implementation of this

minimizing undesirable challenges, we examine three games where component
design choices can influence the stochastic nature of the resulting challenge

392,Beyond the Leaderboard: Insight and Deployment Challenges to Address Research Problems,"In the medical image analysis field, organizing challenges with associated
workshops at international conferences began in 2007 and has grown to include
over 150 challenges. Several of these challenges have had a major impact in the
field. However, whereas well-designed challenges have the potential to unite
and focus the field on creating solutions to important problems, poorly
designed and documented challenges can equally impede a field and lead to
pursuing incremental improvements in metric scores with no theoretic or
clinical significance. This is supported by a critical assessment of challenges
at the international MICCAI conference. In this assessment the main observation
was that small changes to the underlying challenge data can drastically change
the ranking order on the leaderboard. Related to this is the practice of
leaderboard climbing, which is characterized by participants focusing on
incrementally improving metric results rather than advancing science or solving
the driving problem of a challenge. In this abstract we look beyond the
leaderboard of a challenge and instead look at the conclusions that can be
drawn from a challenge with respect to the research problem that it is
addressing. Research study design is well described in other research areas and
can be translated to challenge design when viewing challenges as research
studies on algorithm performance that address a research problem. Based on the
two main types of scientific research study design, we propose two main
challenge types, which we think would benefit other research areas as well: 1)
an insight challenge that is based on a qualitative study design and 2) a
deployment challenge that is based on a quantitative study design. In addition

key of BINGO is to detect the low redshift BAO to put strong constraints in the
dark sector models. Given the versatility of the BINGO telescope, a secondary
goal is astrophysics, where BINGO can help discover and study Fast Radio Bursts

constraints of the three radio telescopes with Planck. We find that, the $1

402,BinGo: Pinpointing Concurrency Bugs in Go via Binary Analysis,"Golang (also known as Go for short) has become popular in building
concurrency programs in distributed systems. As the unique features, Go employs
lightweight Goroutines to support highly parallelism in user space. Moreover,
Go leverages channels to enable explicit communication among threads. However,
recent studies show that concurrency bugs are not uncommon in Go applications.
Pinpointing these concurrency bugs in real Go applications is both important
and challenging. Existing approaches are mostly based on compiler-aided static
or dynamic analysis, which have two limitations. First, existing approaches
require the availability and recompilation of the source code, which work well
on testing rather than production environments with no source code available
for both applications and external libraries. Second, existing approaches work
on pure Go code bases only, not programs mixed with Go and other languages. To
address these limitations, we develop BinGo, the first tool to identify
concurrency bugs in Go applications via dynamic binary analysis. BinGo
correlates binary execution with Go semantics and employs novel bug detection
algorithms. BinGo is an end-to-end tool that is ready for deployment in the
production environment with no modification on source code, compilers, and
runtimes in the Go eco-system. Our experiments show that BinGo has a high
coverage of concurrency bugs with no false positives. We are able to use BinGo

medical images. Current approaches to this problem involve developing
similarity measures over the joint intensity profile of all images, which may
be computationally prohibitive for large image groups and unstable under
various conditions. To tackle these issues, we propose BInGo, a general
unsupervised hierarchical Bayesian framework based on deep learning, to learn
intrinsic structural representations to measure the similarity of multimodal
images. Particularly, a variational auto-encoder with a novel posterior is
proposed, which facilitates the disentanglement learning of structural
representations and spatial transformations, and characterizes the imaging
process from the common structure with shape transition and appearance
variation. Notably, BInGo is scalable to learn from small groups, whereas being
tested for large-scale groupwise registration, thus significantly reducing
computational costs. We compared BInGo with five iterative or deep learning
methods on three public intrasubject and intersubject datasets, i.e. BraTS,
MS-CMR of the heart, and Learn2Reg abdomen MR-CT, and demonstrated its superior
accuracy and computational efficiency, even for very large group sizes (e.g.,

407,The BINGO telescope: a new instrument exploring the new 21-cm cosmology window,"BINGO is a unique radio telescope designed to make the first detection of
Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) at radio frequencies. This will be achieved
by measuring the distribution of neutral hydrogen gas at cosmological distances
using a technique called Intensity Mapping. Along with the Cosmic Microwave
Background anisotropies, the scale of BAO is one of the most powerful probes of
cosmological parameters, including dark energy. The telescope will be built in
a very low RFI site in South America and will operate in the frequency range
from 0.96 GHz to 1.26 GHz. The telescope design consists of two $\thicksim$
40-m compact mirrors with no moving parts. Such a design will give the
excellent polarization performance and very low sidelobe levels required for
intensity mapping. With a feedhorn array of 50 receivers, it will map a
$15^{\circ}$ declination strip as the sky drifts past the field-of-view of the
telescope. The BINGO consortium is composed Universidade de S\~ao Paulo,
Instituto Nacional de Pesquisas Espaciais (Brazil), University of Manchester
and University College London (United Kingdom), ETH Z\""urich (Switzerland) and
Universidad de La Republica (Uruguay). The telescope assembly and horn design

calculate all the different contributions to the bi-spectrum and the parameter
f_{NL} for an arbitrary triangular configuration of the wavevectors. Focusing
firstly on the equilateral limit, we illustrate the accuracy of BINGO by
comparing the results from the code with the spectral dependence of the
bi-spectrum expected in power law inflation. Then, considering an arbitrary
triangular configuration, we contrast the numerical results with the analytical
expression available in the slow roll limit, for, say, the case of the
conventional quadratic potential. Considering a non-trivial scenario involving
deviations from slow roll, we compare the results from the code with the
analytical results that have recently been obtained in the case of the
Starobinsky model in the equilateral limit. As an immediate application, we

hydrogen (HI). In this work, we simulate BINGO (BAO from Integrated Neutral Gas
Observations) and SKA (Square Kilometre Array) phase-1 dish array operating in
auto-correlation mode. For the optimal case of BINGO with no foregrounds, the
combination of the HI angular power spectra with Planck results allows $w$ to
be measured with a precision of $4\%$, while the combination of the BAO
acoustic scale with Planck gives a precision of $7\%$. We consider a number of
potentially complicating effects, including foregrounds and redshift dependent
bias, which increase the uncertainty on $w$ but not dramatically; in all cases
the final uncertainty is found to be $\Delta w < 8\%$ for BINGO. For the
combination of SKA-MID in auto-correlation mode with Planck, we find that, in
ideal conditions, $w$ can be measured with a precision of $4\%$ for the
redshift range $0.35 < z < 3$ (i.e., for the bandwidth of $\Delta \nu = [350,

cosmological signal from the much stronger foreground contributions at radio
frequencies. The BINGO radio telescope is designed to measure the 21 cm line
and detect BAOs using the intensity mapping technique. This work analyses the
performance of the GNILC method, combined with a power spectrum debiasing
procedure. The method was applied to a simulated BINGO mission, building upon
previous work from the collaboration. It compares two different synchrotron
emission models and different instrumental configurations, in addition to the
combination with ancillary data to optimize both the foreground removal and
recovery of the 21 cm signal across the full BINGO frequency band, as well as
to determine an optimal number of frequency bands for the signal recovery. We
have produced foreground emissions maps using the Planck Sky Model, the
cosmological Hi emission maps are generated using the FLASK package and thermal
noise maps are created according to the instrumental setup. We apply the GNILC
method to the simulated sky maps to separate the Hi plus thermal noise
contribution and, through a debiasing procedure, recover an estimate of the
noiseless 21 cm power spectrum. We found a near optimal reconstruction of the
Hi signal using a 80 bins configuration, which resulted in a power spectrum
reconstruction average error over all frequencies of 3%. Furthermore, our tests
showed that GNILC is robust against different synchrotron emission models.
Finally, adding an extra channel with CBASS foregrounds information, we reduced
the estimation error of the 21 cm signal. The optimisation of our previous
work, producing a configuration with an optimal number of channels for binning
the data, impacts greatly the decisions regarding BINGO hardware configuration

417,The BINGO project VIII: On the recoverability of the BAO signal on HI intensity mapping simulations,"A new and promising technique for observing the Universe and study the dark
sector is the intensity mapping of the redshifted 21cm line of neutral hydrogen
(HI). The BINGO radio telescope will use the 21cm line to map the Universe in
the redshift range $0.127 \le z \le 0.449$, in a tomographic approach, with the
main goal of probing BAO. This work presents the forecasts of measuring the
transversal BAO signal during the BINGO Phase 1 operation. We use two
clustering estimators, the two-point angular correlation function (ACF) and the
angular power spectrum (APS), and a template-based method to model the ACF and
APS estimated from simulations of the BINGO region and extract the BAO
information. The tomographic approach allows the combination of redshift bins
to improve the template fitting performance. We find that each clustering
estimator shows different sensitivities to specific redshift ranges, although
both of them perform better at higher redshifts. In general, the APS estimator
provides slightly better estimates, with smaller uncertainties and larger
probability of detection of the BAO signal, achieving $\gtrsim 90$\% at higher
redshifts. We investigate the contribution from instrumental noise and residual
foreground signals and find that the former has the greater impact, getting
more significant as the redshift increases, in particular the APS estimator.
Indeed, including noise in the analysis increases the uncertainty up to a
factor of $\sim 2.2$ at higher redshifts. Foreground residuals, in contrast, do
not significantly affect our final uncertainties. In summary, our results show
that, even including semi-realistic systematic effects, BINGO has the potential

identify voting scenarios in which uncertainty about the voting method may

frequencies. BINGO has two science goals: cosmology and astrophysics. Cosmology
is the main science goal and the driver for BINGO's design and strategy. The
key of BINGO is to detect the low redshift BAO to put strong constraints in the
dark sector models. Given the versatility of the BINGO telescope, a secondary
goal is astrophysics, where BINGO can help discover and study Fast Radio Bursts
(FRB) and other transients, Galactic and extragalactic science. In this paper,
we introduce the latest progress of the BINGO project, its science goals,
describing the scientific potential of the project in each science and the new
developments obtained by the collaboration. We introduce the BINGO project and
its science goals and give a general summary of recent developments in
construction, science potential and pipeline development obtained by the BINGO
collaboration in the past few years. We show that BINGO will be able to obtain
competitive constraints for the dark sector, and also that will allow for the
discovery of several FRBs in the southern hemisphere. The capacity of BINGO in
obtaining information from 21-cm is also tested in the pipeline introduced
here. There is still no measurement of the BAO in radio, and studying cosmology
in this new window of observations is one of the most promising advances in the
field. The BINGO project is a radio telescope that has the goal to be one of
the first to perform this measurement and it is currently being built in the
northeast of Brazil. (Abridged)",2107.01633v2,astro-ph.CO,2021-07-04 14:06:48+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Elcio Abdalla'), arxiv.Result.Author('Elisa G. M.

422,"Forecasts of cosmological constraints from HI intensity mapping with FAST, BINGO & SKA-I","We forecast the cosmological constraints of the neutral hydrogen (HI)
intensity mapping (IM) technique with radio telescopes by assuming 1-year of
observational time. The current and future radio telescopes we consider here
are FAST (Five hundred meter Aperture Spherical Telescope), BINGO (Baryon
acoustic oscillations In Neutral Gas Observations), and SKA-I (Square Kilometre
Array phase I) single-dish experiment. We also forecast the combined
constraints of the three radio telescopes with Planck. We find that, the $1
\sigma$ errors of $(w_{0}, w_{a})$ for BINGO, FAST and SKA-I with respect to
the fiducial values are respectively, $(0.9293, 3.5792), (0.4083, 1.5878),

87.09\%)$ improvements in constraining $(w_{0}, w_{a})$ for FAST and SKA-I
relative to BINGO. Simulations further show that SKA-I will put more stringent
constraints than both FAST and BINGO when each of the experiment is combined
with Planck measurement. For the $9$ cosmological parameters in consideration,
we find that, there is a trade-off between SKA-I and FAST in constraining
cosmological parameters, with each experiment being more superior in

423,BinGo: Pinpointing Concurrency Bugs in Go via Binary Analysis,"Golang (also known as Go for short) has become popular in building
concurrency programs in distributed systems. As the unique features, Go employs
lightweight Goroutines to support highly parallelism in user space. Moreover,
Go leverages channels to enable explicit communication among threads. However,
recent studies show that concurrency bugs are not uncommon in Go applications.
Pinpointing these concurrency bugs in real Go applications is both important
and challenging. Existing approaches are mostly based on compiler-aided static
or dynamic analysis, which have two limitations. First, existing approaches
require the availability and recompilation of the source code, which work well
on testing rather than production environments with no source code available
for both applications and external libraries. Second, existing approaches work
on pure Go code bases only, not programs mixed with Go and other languages. To
address these limitations, we develop BinGo, the first tool to identify
concurrency bugs in Go applications via dynamic binary analysis. BinGo
correlates binary execution with Go semantics and employs novel bug detection
algorithms. BinGo is an end-to-end tool that is ready for deployment in the
production environment with no modification on source code, compilers, and
runtimes in the Go eco-system. Our experiments show that BinGo has a high
coverage of concurrency bugs with no false positives. We are able to use BinGo
to identify concurrency bugs in real applications with moderate overhead.",2201.06753v2,cs.PL,2022-01-18 05:33:22+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Chongxin Zhong'), arxiv.Result.Author('Qidong Zhao'), arxiv.Result.Author('Xu Liu')]",

of a large population are sufficiently available or motivated to vote. A common
solution to increase participation is to allow voters use a proxy, that is,
transfer their voting rights to another voter. Considering social choice
problems on metric spaces, we compare voting with and without the use of
proxies to see which mechanism better approximates the optimal outcome, and
characterize the regimes in which proxy voting is beneficial. When voters'
opinions are located on an interval, both the median mechanism and the mean
mechanism are substantially improved by proxy voting. When voters vote on many
binary issues, proxy voting is better when the sample of active voters is too
small to provide a good outcome. Our theoretical results extend to situations
where available voters choose strategically whether to participate. We support
our theoretical findings with empirical results showing substantial benefits of
proxy voting on simulated and real preference data.",1611.08308v1,cs.GT,2016-11-24 21:05:50+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Gal Cohensius'), arxiv.Result.Author('Shie Manor'), arxiv.Result.Author('Reshef Meir'), arxiv.Result.Author('Eli Meirom'), arxiv.Result.Author('Ariel Orda')]",

unsupervised hierarchical Bayesian framework based on deep learning, to learn
intrinsic structural representations to measure the similarity of multimodal
images. Particularly, a variational auto-encoder with a novel posterior is
proposed, which facilitates the disentanglement learning of structural
representations and spatial transformations, and characterizes the imaging
process from the common structure with shape transition and appearance
variation. Notably, BInGo is scalable to learn from small groups, whereas being

Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) at radio frequencies. This will be achieved
by measuring the distribution of neutral hydrogen gas at cosmological distances
using a technique called Intensity Mapping. Along with the Cosmic Microwave
Background anisotropies, the scale of BAO is one of the most powerful probes of
cosmological parameters, including dark energy. The telescope will be built in
a very low RFI site in South America and will operate in the frequency range
from 0.96 GHz to 1.26 GHz. The telescope design consists of two $\thicksim$
40-m compact mirrors with no moving parts. Such a design will give the
excellent polarization performance and very low sidelobe levels required for
intensity mapping. With a feedhorn array of 50 receivers, it will map a

inflationary models involving the canonical scalar field. The code can
calculate all the different contributions to the bi-spectrum and the parameter
f_{NL} for an arbitrary triangular configuration of the wavevectors. Focusing
firstly on the equilateral limit, we illustrate the accuracy of BINGO by
comparing the results from the code with the spectral dependence of the
bi-spectrum expected in power law inflation. Then, considering an arbitrary
triangular configuration, we contrast the numerical results with the analytical
expression available in the slow roll limit, for, say, the case of the
conventional quadratic potential. Considering a non-trivial scenario involving
deviations from slow roll, we compare the results from the code with the
analytical results that have recently been obtained in the case of the
Starobinsky model in the equilateral limit. As an immediate application, we
utilize BINGO to examine of the power of the non-Gaussianity parameter f_{NL}

slow roll and lead to similar features in the scalar power spectrum. We close

431,Enhancing Engagement in Token-Curated Registries via an Inflationary Mechanism,"Token Curated Registries (TCR) are decentralized recommendation systems that
can be implemented using Blockchain smart contracts. They allow participants to
vote for or against adding items to a list through a process that involves
staking tokens intrinsic to the registry, with winners receiving the staked
tokens for each vote. A TCR aims to provide incentives to create a well-curated
list. In this work, we consider a challenge for these systems - incentivizing
token-holders to actually engage and participate in the voting process. We
propose a novel token-inflation mechanism for enhancing engagement, whereby
only voting participants see their token supply increased by a pre-defined
multiple after each round of voting. To evaluate this proposal, we propose a
simple 4-class model of voters that captures all possible combinations of two
key dimensions: whether they are engaged (likely to vote at all for a given
item) or disengaged, and whether they are informed (likely to vote in a way
that increases the quality of the list) or uninformed, and a simple metric to
evaluate the quality of the list as a function of the vote outcomes. We conduct
simulations using this model of voters and show that implementing
token-inflation results in greater wealth accumulation for engaged voters. In
particular, when the number of informed voters is sufficiently high, our
simulations show that voters that are both informed and engaged see the
greatest benefits from participating in the registry when our proposed
token-inflation mechanism is employed. We further validate this finding using a
simplified mathematical analysis.",1811.09680v1,cs.GT,2018-11-23 20:51:13+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Yi Lucy Wang'), arxiv.Result.Author('Bhaskar Krishnamachari')]",
432,Measuring Violations of Positive Involvement in Voting,"In the context of computational social choice, we study voting methods that
assign a set of winners to each profile of voter preferences. A voting method
satisfies the property of positive involvement (PI) if for any election in
which a candidate x would be among the winners, adding another voter to the
election who ranks x first does not cause x to lose. Surprisingly, a number of
standard voting methods violate this natural property. In this paper, we
investigate different ways of measuring the extent to which a voting method
violates PI, using computer simulations. We consider the probability (under
different probability models for preferences) of PI violations in randomly
drawn profiles vs. profile-coalition pairs (involving coalitions of different
sizes). We argue that in order to choose between a voting method that satisfies
PI and one that does not, we should consider the probability of PI violation
conditional on the voting methods choosing different winners. We should also
relativize the probability of PI violation to what we call voter potency, the
probability that a voter causes a candidate to lose. Although absolute
frequencies of PI violations may be low, after this conditioning and
relativization, we see that under certain voting methods that violate PI, much
of a voter's potency is turned against them - in particular, against their
desire to see their favorite candidate elected.",2106.11502v1,cs.GT,2021-06-22 02:46:37+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Wesley H. Holliday'), arxiv.Result.Author('Eric Pacuit')]","EPTCS 335, 2021, pp. 189-209"

deploy Bingo at select network nodes (base stations, packet core, data center)

memberships of users using the available user-content request logs without any
prior knowledge of the overlaid social graph. Bingo can cater to the evolving

Approval Voting gives a non-proportional but strategyproof voting rule. We show
that there is a fundamental tradeoff between these two properties: we prove
that no multiwinner voting rule can simultaneously satisfy a weak form of
proportionality (a weakening of justified representation) and a weak form of
strategyproofness. Our impossibility is obtained using a formulation of the

440,Privacy-Enabled Biometric Search,"Biometrics have a long-held hope of replacing passwords by establishing a
non-repudiated identity and providing authentication with convenience.
Convenience drives consumers toward biometrics-based access management
solutions. Unlike passwords, biometrics cannot be script-injected; however,
biometric data is considered highly sensitive due to its personal nature and
unique association with users. Biometrics differ from passwords in that
compromised passwords may be reset. Compromised biometrics offer no such
relief. A compromised biometric offers unlimited risk in privacy (anyone can
view the biometric) and authentication (anyone may use the biometric).
Standards such as the Biometric Open Protocol Standard (BOPS) (IEEE 2410-2016)
provide a detailed mechanism to authenticate biometrics based on pre-enrolled
devices and a previous identity by storing the biometric in encrypted form.
This paper describes a biometric-agnostic approach that addresses the privacy
concerns of biometrics through the implementation of BOPS. Specifically, two
novel concepts are introduced. First, a biometric is applied to a neural
network to create a feature vector. This neural network alone can be used for
one-to-one matching (authentication), but would require a search in linear time
for the one-to-many case (identity lookup). The classifying algorithm described
in this paper addresses this concern by producing normalized floating-point
values for each feature vector. This allows authentication lookup to occur in
up to polynomial time, allowing for search in encrypted biometric databases

of storing the original biometric templates transformed templates can be

revocable/cancelable templates are generated. Soft biometrics is ancillary
information that can be combined with primary biometrics to identify a person

like fingerprint. Iris is an internal part that is less prone to damage.
Moreover is very difficult for an attacker to capture an iris. The key

advantages, including lower error rate, higher accuracy, and larger population
coverage. However, multimodal systems have an increased demand for integrity
and privacy because they must store multiple biometric traits associated with
each user. In this paper, we present a deep learning framework for
feature-level fusion that generates a secure multimodal template from each
user's face and iris biometrics. We integrate a deep hashing (binarization)
technique into the fusion architecture to generate a robust binary multimodal
shared latent representation. Further, we employ a hybrid secure architecture
by combining cancelable biometrics with secure sketch techniques and integrate
it with a deep hashing framework, which makes it computationally prohibitive to
forge a combination of multiple biometrics that pass the authentication. The
efficacy of the proposed approach is shown using a multimodal database of face
and iris and it is observed that the matching performance is improved due to
the fusion of multiple biometrics. Furthermore, the proposed approach also
provides cancelability and unlinkability of the templates along with improved
privacy of the biometric data. Additionally, we also test the proposed hashing
function for an image retrieval application using a benchmark dataset. The main
goal of this paper is to develop a method for integrating multimodal fusion,
deep hashing, and biometric security, with an emphasis on structural data from
modalities like face and iris. The proposed approach is in no way a general

minimum guarantee is essential. When there are no minimum quotas, stability is
the de-facto notion of optimality. However, in the presence of minimum quotas,
ensuring stability and simultaneously satisfying lower quotas is not an
attainable goal in many instances.
  To address this, a relaxation of stability known as envy-freeness, is
proposed in literature. In our work, we thoroughly investigate envy-freeness
from a computational view point. Our results show that computing envy-free
matchings that match maximum number of agents is computationally hard and also
hard to approximate up to a constant factor. Additionally, it is known that
envy-free matchings satisfying lower-quotas may not exist. To circumvent these
drawbacks, we propose a new notion called relaxed stability. We show that
relaxed stable matchings are guaranteed to exist even in the presence of
lower-quotas. Despite the computational intractability of finding a largest

elections are based on the selection of top-ranking individuals from a larger
pool of candidates. This process is often subject to biases, which typically
manifest as an under-representation of certain groups among the selected or
accepted individuals. The most common approach to this issue is debiasing, for
example via the introduction of quotas that ensure proportional representation
of groups with respect to a certain, often binary attribute. Cases include
quotas for women on corporate boards or ethnic quotas in elections. This,
however, has the potential to induce changes in representation with respect to
other attributes. For the case of two correlated binary attributes we show that
quota-based debiasing based on a single attribute can worsen the representation
of already underrepresented groups and decrease overall fairness of selection.
We use several data sets from a broad range of domains from recidivism risk
assessments to scientific citations to assess this effect in real-world
settings. Our results demonstrate the importance of including all relevant
attributes in debiasing procedures and that more efforts need to be put into

matching, which is a relaxation of a stable matching preserving a kind of
fairness property. In this paper, we investigate the existence of an envy-free
matching in several settings, in which hospitals have lower quotas and not all
doctor-hospital pairs are acceptable. We first show that, for an HR-LQ
instance, we can efficiently decide the existence of an envy-free matching.
Then, we consider envy-freeness in the Classified Stable Matching model due to
Huang (2010), i.e., each hospital has lower and upper quotas on subsets of
doctors. We show that, for this model, deciding the existence of an envy-free
matching is NP-hard in general, but solvable in polynomial time if quotas are

to consume their most preferred available object until the total mass of agents
yet to be allocated is exactly equal to the remaining amount of unfilled lower
quotas; in this case, we restrict agents' menus to objects which are yet to
fill their minimum quotas. We show the mechanisms satisfy the same criteria as

the Null of random hiring that requires no information about individual hires

samples from the exact distribution. This test can be used to analyze a variety
of other hiring settings. I analyze the distribution of female professors at
German universities across 50 different disciplines. I show that the
distribution of women, given the average number of women in the respective
field, is highly unlikely to result from a random allocation of women across
departments and more likely to stem from an implicit quota of one or two women
on the department level. I also show that a large part of the variation in the
share of women across STEM and non-STEM disciplines could be explained by a
two-women quota on the department level. These findings have important
implications for the potential effectiveness of policies aimed at reducing

problem. We are given an undirected bipartite graph $G= (A \cup P, E)$ with
weights on the edges in $E$, and with lower and upper quotas on the vertices in
$P$. We seek a maximum weight many-to-one matching satisfying two sets of
constraints: vertices in $A$ are incident to at most one matching edge, while
vertices in $P$ are either unmatched or they are incident to a number of
matching edges between their lower and upper quota. This problem, which we call
maximum weight many-to-one matching with lower and upper quotas (WMLQ), has
applications to the assignment of students to projects within university
courses, where there are constraints on the minimum and maximum numbers of
students that must be assigned to each project.
  In this paper, we provide a comprehensive analysis of the complexity of WMLQ
from the viewpoints of classic polynomial time algorithms, fixed-parameter
tractability, as well as approximability. We draw the line between NP-hard and
polynomially tractable instances in terms of degree and quota constraints and
provide efficient algorithms to solve the tractable ones. We further show that
the problem can be solved in polynomial time for instances with bounded
treewidth; however, the corresponding runtime is exponential in the treewidth
with the maximum upper quota $u_{max}$ as basis, and we prove that this
dependence is necessary unless FPT = W[1]. The approximability of WMLQ is also
discussed: we present an approximation algorithm for the general case with

478,Popular Matching with Lower Quotas,"We consider the well-studied Hospital Residents (HR) problem in the presence
of lower quotas (LQ). The input instance consists of a bipartite graph $G =
(\mathcal{R} \cup \mathcal{H}, E)$ where $\mathcal{R}$ and $\mathcal{H}$ denote
sets of residents and hospitals respectively. Every vertex has a preference
list that imposes a strict ordering on its neighbors. In addition, each
hospital $h$ has an associated upper-quota $q^+(h)$ and lower-quota $q^-(h)$. A
matching $M$ in $G$ is an assignment of residents to hospitals, and $M$ is said
to be feasible if every resident is assigned to at most one hospital and a
hospital $h$ is assigned at least $q^-(h)$ and at most $q^+(h)$ residents.
  Stability is a de-facto notion of optimality in a model where both sets of
vertices have preferences. A matching is stable if no unassigned pair has an
incentive to deviate from it. It is well-known that an instance of the HRLQ
problem need not admit a feasible stable matching. In this paper, we consider
the notion of popularity for the HRLQ problem. A matching $M$ is popular if no
other matching $M'$ gets more votes than $M$ when vertices vote between $M$ and
$M'$. When there are no lower quotas, there always exists a stable matching and
it is known that every stable matching is popular.
  We show that in an HRLQ instance, although a feasible stable matching need
not exist, there is always a matching that is popular in the set of feasible
matchings. We give an efficient algorithm to compute a maximum cardinality

two-sided lower quotas, informally, a critical matching is a matching which
fulfils vertex lower quotas to the maximum possible extent. This is a natural
generalization of the definition of a critical matching in the one-to-one
setting [19]. Our goal in the given problem is to find a popular matching in
the set of critical matchings. A matching is popular in a given set of
matchings if it remains undefeated in a head-to-head election with any matching
in that set. Here, vertices cast votes between pairs of matchings. We show that

The white-box testing is performed when the source code of the GraphQL API is
available. Our approach is based on evolutionary search. Test cases are evolved
to intelligently explore the solution space while maximizing code coverage and
fault-finding criteria. The black-box testing does not require access to the
source code of the GraphQL API. It is therefore of more general applicability,
albeit it has worse performance. In this context, we use a random search to
generate GraphQL data. The proposed framework is implemented and integrated
into the open-source EvoMaster tool. With enabled white-box heuristics, i.e.,
white-box mode, experiments on 7 open-source GraphQL APIs show statistically
significant improvement of the evolutionary approach compared to the baseline

increasing prediction with the increase of some attribute values. While there
exist multiple ML algorithms for ensuring monotonicity of the generated model,
approaches for checking monotonicity, in particular of black-box models, are
largely lacking. In this work, we propose verification-based testing of
monotonicity, i.e., the formal computation of test inputs on a white-box model
via verification technology, and the automatic inference of this approximating
white-box model from the black-box model under test. On the white-box model,
the space of test inputs can be systematically explored by a directed

gaining interpretability is often inevitable, putting practitioners in a
dilemma of choosing between high accuracy (black-box models) and
interpretability (interpretable models). In this work, we propose a novel
framework for building a Hybrid Predictive Model (HPM) that integrates an
interpretable model with any black-box model to combine their strengths. The
interpretable model substitutes the black-box model on a subset of data where
the black-box is overkill or nearly overkill, gaining transparency at no or low
cost of the predictive accuracy. We design a principled objective function that
considers predictive accuracy, model interpretability, and model transparency
(defined as the percentage of data processed by the interpretable substitute.)
Under this framework, we propose two hybrid models, one substituting with
association rules and the other with linear models, and we design customized
training algorithms for both models. We test the hybrid models on structured
data and text data where interpretable models collaborate with various
state-of-the-art black-box models. Results show that hybrid models obtain an

488,REST: Performance Improvement of a Black Box Model via RL-based Spatial Transformation,"In recent years, deep neural networks (DNN) have become a highly active area
of research, and shown remarkable achievements on a variety of computer vision
tasks. DNNs, however, are known to often make overconfident yet incorrect
predictions on out-of-distribution samples, which can be a major obstacle to
real-world deployments because the training dataset is always limited compared
to diverse real-world samples. Thus, it is fundamental to provide guarantees of
robustness to the distribution shift between training and test time when we
construct DNN models in practice. Moreover, in many cases, the deep learning
models are deployed as black boxes and the performance has been already
optimized for a training dataset, thus changing the black box itself can lead
to performance degradation. We here study the robustness to the geometric
transformations in a specific condition where the black-box image classifier is
given. We propose an additional learner, \emph{REinforcement Spatial Transform
learner (REST)}, that transforms the warped input data into samples regarded as
in-distribution by the black-box models. Our work aims to improve the
robustness by adding a REST module in front of any black boxes and training
only the REST module without retraining the original black box model in an
end-to-end manner, i.e. we try to convert the real-world data into training
distribution which the performance of the black-box model is best suited for.
We use a confidence score that is obtained from the black-box model to
determine whether the transformed input is drawn from in-distribution. We

490,Towards Lightweight Black-Box Attacks against Deep Neural Networks,"Black-box attacks can generate adversarial examples without accessing the
parameters of target model, largely exacerbating the threats of deployed deep
neural networks (DNNs). However, previous works state that black-box attacks
fail to mislead target models when their training data and outputs are
inaccessible. In this work, we argue that black-box attacks can pose practical
attacks in this extremely restrictive scenario where only several test samples
are available. Specifically, we find that attacking the shallow layers of DNNs
trained on a few test samples can generate powerful adversarial examples. As
only a few samples are required, we refer to these attacks as lightweight
black-box attacks. The main challenge to promoting lightweight attacks is to
mitigate the adverse impact caused by the approximation error of shallow
layers. As it is hard to mitigate the approximation error with few available
samples, we propose Error TransFormer (ETF) for lightweight attacks. Namely,
ETF transforms the approximation error in the parameter space into a
perturbation in the feature space and alleviates the error by disturbing
features. In experiments, lightweight black-box attacks with the proposed ETF
achieve surprising results. For example, even if only 1 sample per category
available, the attack success rate in lightweight black-box attacks is only
about 3% lower than that of the black-box attacks with complete training data.",2209.14826v3,cs.LG,2022-09-29 14:43:03+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Chenghao Sun'), arxiv.Result.Author('Yonggang Zhang'), arxiv.Result.Author('Wan Chaoqun'), arxiv.Result.Author('Qizhou Wang'), arxiv.Result.Author('Ya Li'), arxiv.Result.Author('Tongliang Liu'), arxiv.Result.Author('Bo Han'), arxiv.Result.Author('Xinmei Tian')]",

where the surrogate model is a QUBO matrix. However, unlike in previous
state-of-the-art approaches, this matrix is not trained entirely by regression,
but mostly by classification between 'good' and 'bad' solutions. This better
accounts for the low capacity of the QUBO matrix, resulting in significantly
better solutions overall. We tested our approach against the state-of-the-art
on four domains and in all of them BOX-QUBO showed significantly better
results. A second contribution of this paper is the idea to also solve white
box problems, i.e. problems which could be directly formulated as QUBO, by
means of black box optimization in order to reduce the size of the QUBOs to
their information-theoretic minimum. The experiments show that this

this grey-box information is exploited by the generation algorithm in such a
way that the resulting best-case test suite size is only linear in the state

494,Output Randomization: A Novel Defense for both White-box and Black-box Adversarial Models,"Adversarial examples pose a threat to deep neural network models in a variety
of scenarios, from settings where the adversary has complete knowledge of the
model in a ""white box"" setting and to the opposite in a ""black box"" setting. In
this paper, we explore the use of output randomization as a defense against
attacks in both the black box and white box models and propose two defenses. In
the first defense, we propose output randomization at test time to thwart
finite difference attacks in black box settings. Since this type of attack
relies on repeated queries to the model to estimate gradients, we investigate
the use of randomization to thwart such adversaries from successfully creating
adversarial examples. We empirically show that this defense can limit the
success rate of a black box adversary using the Zeroth Order Optimization
attack to 0%. Secondly, we propose output randomization training as a defense
against white box adversaries. Unlike prior approaches that use randomization,
our defense does not require its use at test time, eliminating the Backward
Pass Differentiable Approximation attack, which was shown to be effective
against other randomization defenses. Additionally, this defense has low
overhead and is easily implemented, allowing it to be used together with other
defenses across various model architectures. We evaluate output randomization
training against the Projected Gradient Descent attacker and show that the
defense can reduce the PGD attack's success rate down to 12% when using
cross-entropy loss.",2107.03806v1,cs.LG,2021-07-08 12:27:19+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Daniel Park'), arxiv.Result.Author('Haidar Khan'), arxiv.Result.Author('Azer Khan'), arxiv.Result.Author('Alex Gittens'), arxiv.Result.Author('Bülent Yener')]",
495,Fine-grained Code Coverage Measurement in Automated Black-box Android Testing,"Today, there are millions of third-party Android applications. Some of these
applications are buggy or even malicious. To identify such applications, novel
frameworks for automated black-box testing and dynamic analysis are being
developed by the Android community, including Google. Code coverage is one of
the most common metrics for evaluating effectiveness of these frameworks.
Furthermore, code coverage is used as a fitness function for guiding
evolutionary and fuzzy testing techniques. However, there are no reliable tools
for measuring fine-grained code coverage in black-box Android app testing.
  We present the Android Code coVerage Tool, ACVTool for short, that
instruments Android apps and measures the code coverage in the black-box
setting at the class, method and instruction granularities. ACVTool has
successfully instrumented 96.9% of apps in our experiments. It introduces a
negligible instrumentation time overhead, and its runtime overhead is
acceptable for automated testing tools. We show in a large-scale experiment

testing results have been analyzed and compared in terms of robustness (i.e.,
success rate) and test coverage. Among the considered tools, RESTler appears to

to what extent the counting methods can be categorized according to selected
characteristics of the counting methods, 3) methods and elements to assess the
internal validity of the counting methods, and 4) to what extent and with which
characteristics the counting methods are used in research evaluations.
  The review identifies 32 counting methods introduced during the period 1981 -
2018. Two frameworks categorize these counting methods. Framework 1 describes
selected mathematical properties of counting methods, and Framework 2 describes
arguments for choosing a counting method. Twenty of the 32 counting methods are
rank-dependent, fractionalized, and introduced to measure contribution,
participation, etc. of an object of study. Next, three criteria for internal
validity are used to identify five methods that test the adequacy of counting
methods, two elements that test sensitivity, and three elements that test
homogeneity of the counting methods. These methods and elements may be used to
assess the internal validity of counting methods. Finally, a literature search
finds research evaluations that use the counting methods. Only three of the 32
counting methods are used by four research evaluations or more. Of these three
counting methods, two are used with the same characteristics as defined in the
studies that introduced the counting methods.

The advantage are simple and easy to implement, while the disadvantages are
slow convergence speed, and the symmetric Kaczmarz method is the same. For the
standard form of this method, once the iterative matrix is generated, it can be
used continuously in the subsequent iterations. Moreover, the iterative matrix

requires knowing how the ballots cast in an election are organized into groups,
for instance, how many containers of ballots there are in all and how many
ballots are in each container. A list of the ballot group identifiers along
with number of ballots in each group is called a ballot manifest. What if the
ballot manifest is not accurate? Surprisingly, even if ballots are known to be
missing from the manifest, it is not necessary to make worst-case assumptions
about those ballots--for instance, to adjust the margin by the number of
missing ballots--to ensure that the audit remains conservative. Rather, it
suffices to make worst-case assumptions about the individual randomly selected
ballots that the audit cannot find. This observation provides a simple
modification to some risk-limiting audit procedures that makes them
automatically become more conservative if the ballot manifest has errors. The
modification--phantoms to evil zombies (~2EZ)--requires only an upper bound on
the total number of ballots cast. ~2EZ makes the audit P-value stochastically
larger than it would be had the manifest been accurate, automatically requiring
more than enough ballots to be audited to offset the manifest errors. This
ensures that the true risk limit remains smaller than the nominal risk limit.
On the other hand, if the manifest is in fact accurate and the upper bound on
the total number of ballots equals the total according to the manifest, ~2EZ

justifiably high confidence that the reported results of an election are
consistent with an audit trail (""ballots""), which can be paper or electronic.
SOBA combines three ideas: (1) publishing cast vote records (CVRs) separately
for each contest, so that anyone can verify that each reported contest outcome
is correct, if the CVRs reflect voters' intentions with sufficient accuracy;
(2) shrouding a mapping between ballots and the CVRs for those ballots to
prevent the loss of privacy that could occur otherwise; (3) assessing the
accuracy with which the CVRs reflect voters' intentions for a collection of
contests while simultaneously assessing the integrity of the shrouded mapping
between ballots and CVRs by comparing randomly selected ballots to the CVRs
that purport to represent them. Step (1) is related to work by the Humboldt
County Election Transparency Project, but publishing CVRs separately for
individual contests rather than images of entire ballots preserves privacy.
Step (2) requires a cryptographic commitment from elections officials.
Observers participate in step (3), which relies on the ""super-simple
simultaneous single-ballot risk-limiting audit."" Step (3) is designed to reveal
relatively few ballots if the shrouded mapping is proper and the CVRs
accurately reflect voter intent. But if the reported outcomes of the contests

Recent studies (e.g., Bernhard, et al. 2020) suggest the verification rate is

of voters being unable to do so accurately or whether this is because voters
simply choose not to attempt verification in the first place. In order to
understand this problem, we conducted an experiment in which 108 participants
participated in a mock election where the BMD displayed the voters' true
choices, but then changed a subset of those choices on the printed ballot. The
design of the printed ballot, the length of the ballot, the number of changes
that were made to the ballot, the location of those changes, and the
instructions provided to the voters were manipulated as part of the experiment.
Results indicated that of those voters who chose to examine the printed ballot,
76% detected anomalies, indicating that voters can reliably detect errors on
their ballot if they will simply review it. This suggests that administrative

evidence against or in support of the recorded result. Risk-limiting audits for

traditional plurality voting in which voters submit rankings over the

restrict the ballot length, the number of candidates a voter is allowed to rank
on their ballot. We theoretically and empirically analyze how ballot length can
influence the outcome of an election, given fixed voter preferences. We show
that there exist preference profiles over $k$ candidates such that up to $k-1$
different candidates win at different ballot lengths. We derive exact lower
bounds on the number of voters required for such profiles and provide a
construction matching the lower bound for unrestricted voter preferences.
Additionally, we characterize which sequences of winners are possible over
ballot lengths and provide explicit profile constructions achieving any
feasible winner sequence. We also examine how classic preference restrictions
influence our results--for instance, single-peakedness makes $k-1$ different
winners impossible but still allows at least $\Omega(\sqrt k)$. Finally, we
analyze a collection of 168 real-world elections, where we truncate rankings to
simulate shorter ballots. We find that shorter ballots could have changed the
outcome in one quarter of these elections. Our results highlight ballot length
as a consequential degree of freedom in the design of IRV elections.",2207.08958v3,cs.MA,2022-07-18 22:01:13+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Kiran Tomlinson'), arxiv.Result.Author('Johan Ugander'), arxiv.Result.Author('Jon Kleinberg')]",

requires knowing how the ballots cast in an election are organized into groups,
for instance, how many containers of ballots there are in all and how many
ballots are in each container. A list of the ballot group identifiers along
with number of ballots in each group is called a ballot manifest. What if the
ballot manifest is not accurate? Surprisingly, even if ballots are known to be
missing from the manifest, it is not necessary to make worst-case assumptions
about those ballots--for instance, to adjust the margin by the number of
missing ballots--to ensure that the audit remains conservative. Rather, it
suffices to make worst-case assumptions about the individual randomly selected
ballots that the audit cannot find. This observation provides a simple
modification to some risk-limiting audit procedures that makes them
automatically become more conservative if the ballot manifest has errors. The
modification--phantoms to evil zombies (~2EZ)--requires only an upper bound on
the total number of ballots cast. ~2EZ makes the audit P-value stochastically
larger than it would be had the manifest been accurate, automatically requiring
more than enough ballots to be audited to offset the manifest errors. This
ensures that the true risk limit remains smaller than the nominal risk limit.
On the other hand, if the manifest is in fact accurate and the upper bound on
the total number of ballots equals the total according to the manifest, ~2EZ
has no effect at all on the number of ballots audited nor on the true risk
limit.",1207.3413v1,stat.AP,2012-07-14 11:26:02+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Jorge H. Banuelos'), arxiv.Result.Author('Philip B. Stark')]",

it does not require a ballot manifest; (2) it can be conducted independently at
different locations, rather than requiring a central authority to select the
sample from the whole population of cast ballots or requiring stratified
sampling; (3) it can start in polling places on election night, before margins
are known. If the reported margins for the 2016 U.S. Presidential election are
correct, a Bernoulli ballot-polling audit with a risk limit of 5% and a
sampling rate of $p_0 = 1\%$ would have had at least a 99% probability of

symmetric Dyck tiling ribbon (symDTR). We give two definitions of Hermite

of the correspondence between symDTS operation and an Hermite history. Since
ballot tilings form a subset in the set of symmetric Dyck tilings, we construct
an inclusive map from labeled trees for ballot tilings to labeled trees for

tilings can be applied to those of ballot tilings. We introduce and study the

justifiably high confidence that the reported results of an election are
consistent with an audit trail (""ballots""), which can be paper or electronic.
SOBA combines three ideas: (1) publishing cast vote records (CVRs) separately
for each contest, so that anyone can verify that each reported contest outcome
is correct, if the CVRs reflect voters' intentions with sufficient accuracy;
(2) shrouding a mapping between ballots and the CVRs for those ballots to
prevent the loss of privacy that could occur otherwise; (3) assessing the
accuracy with which the CVRs reflect voters' intentions for a collection of
contests while simultaneously assessing the integrity of the shrouded mapping
between ballots and CVRs by comparing randomly selected ballots to the CVRs
that purport to represent them. Step (1) is related to work by the Humboldt
County Election Transparency Project, but publishing CVRs separately for
individual contests rather than images of entire ballots preserves privacy.
Step (2) requires a cryptographic commitment from elections officials.
Observers participate in step (3), which relies on the ""super-simple
simultaneous single-ballot risk-limiting audit."" Step (3) is designed to reveal
relatively few ballots if the shrouded mapping is proper and the CVRs
accurately reflect voter intent. But if the reported outcomes of the contests
differ from the outcomes that a full hand count would show, step (3) is
guaranteed to have a large chance of requiring all the ballots to be counted by
hand, thereby limiting the risk that an incorrect outcome will become official

550,"Voter Verification of BMD Ballots Is a Two-Part Question: Can They? Mostly, They Can. Do They? Mostly, They Don't","The question of whether or not voters actually verify ballots produced by
ballot marking devices (BMDs) is presently the subject of some controversy.
Recent studies (e.g., Bernhard, et al. 2020) suggest the verification rate is
low. What is not clear from previous research is whether this is more a result
of voters being unable to do so accurately or whether this is because voters
simply choose not to attempt verification in the first place. In order to
understand this problem, we conducted an experiment in which 108 participants
participated in a mock election where the BMD displayed the voters' true
choices, but then changed a subset of those choices on the printed ballot. The
design of the printed ballot, the length of the ballot, the number of changes
that were made to the ballot, the location of those changes, and the
instructions provided to the voters were manipulated as part of the experiment.
Results indicated that of those voters who chose to examine the printed ballot,
76% detected anomalies, indicating that voters can reliably detect errors on
their ballot if they will simply review it. This suggests that administrative
remedies, rather than attempts to alter fundamental human perceptual
capabilities, could be employed to encourage voters to check their ballots,

traditional plurality voting in which voters submit rankings over the
candidates rather than single votes. In practice, elections using IRV often
restrict the ballot length, the number of candidates a voter is allowed to rank
on their ballot. We theoretically and empirically analyze how ballot length can
influence the outcome of an election, given fixed voter preferences. We show
that there exist preference profiles over $k$ candidates such that up to $k-1$
different candidates win at different ballot lengths. We derive exact lower
bounds on the number of voters required for such profiles and provide a
construction matching the lower bound for unrestricted voter preferences.
Additionally, we characterize which sequences of winners are possible over
ballot lengths and provide explicit profile constructions achieving any
feasible winner sequence. We also examine how classic preference restrictions
influence our results--for instance, single-peakedness makes $k-1$ different
winners impossible but still allows at least $\Omega(\sqrt k)$. Finally, we
analyze a collection of 168 real-world elections, where we truncate rankings to
simulate shorter ballots. We find that shorter ballots could have changed the
outcome in one quarter of these elections. Our results highlight ballot length

et al. (Eurocrypt'20). We present two short signature schemes achieving this
notion: one is in the quantum random oracle model, assuming quantum hardness of
SIS; and the other is in the plain model, assuming quantum hardness of LWE with
super-polynomial modulus. Prior to this work, the only known blind-unforgeable
schemes are Lamport's one-time signature and the Winternitz one-time signature,
and both of them are in the quantum random oracle model.
  For ring signatures, the recent work by Chatterjee et al. (Crypto'21)
proposes a definition trying to capture adversaries with quantum access to the
signer. However, it is unclear if their definition, when restricted to the
classical world, is as strong as the standard security notion for ring
signatures. They also present a construction that only partially achieves
(even) this seeming weak definition, in the sense that the adversary can only
conduct superposition attacks over the messages, but not the rings. We propose
a new definition that does not suffer from the above issue. Our definition is
an analog to the blind-unforgeability in the ring signature setting. Moreover,
assuming the quantum hardness of LWE, we construct a compiler converting any

574,Focused blind deconvolution,"We introduce a novel multichannel blind deconvolution (BD) method that
extracts sparse and front-loaded impulse responses from the channel outputs,
i.e., their convolutions with a single arbitrary source. A crucial feature of
this formulation is that it doesn't encode support restrictions on the
unknowns, unlike most prior work on BD. The indeterminacy inherent to BD, which
is difficult to resolve with a traditional L1 penalty on the impulse responses,
is resolved in our method because it seeks a first approximation where the
impulse responses are: ""maximally white"" -- encoded as the energy focusing near
zero lag of the impulse-response auto-correlations; and ""maximally
front-loaded"" -- encoded as the energy focusing near zero time of the impulse
responses. Hence we call the method focused blind deconvolution (FBD). The
focusing constraints are relaxed as the iterations progress. Note that FBD
requires the duration of the channel outputs to be longer than that of the
unknown impulse responses.
  A multichannel blind deconvolution problem that is appropriately formulated
by sparse and front-loaded impulse responses arises in seismic inversion, where
the impulse responses are the Green's function evaluations at different
receiver locations, and the operation of a drill bit inputs the noisy and
correlated source signature into the subsurface. We demonstrate the benefits of
FBD using seismic-while-drilling numerical experiments, where the noisy data
recorded at the receivers are hard to interpret, but FBD can provide the
processing essential to separate the drill-bit (source) signature from the
interpretable Green's function.",1808.00166v1,eess.SP,2018-08-01 04:45:31+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Pawan Bharadwaj'), arxiv.Result.Author('Laurent Demanet'), arxiv.Result.Author('Aimé Fournier')]",

the possibility to explore a generic classes of scalar dark matter models using
the complementary searches via phase transition gravitational waves and the
future lepton collider signatures. We focus on the inert scalar multiplet dark
matter models and the mixed inert scalar dark matter models, which could
undergo a strong first-order phase transitions during the evolution of the
early universe, and might produce detectable phase transition GW signals at
future GW experiments, such as eLISA, DECIGO and BBO. We find that the future
GW signature, together with circular electron-positron collider, could further
explore the model's blind spot parameter region, at which the dark matter-Higgs
coupling is identically zero, thus avoiding the dark matter spin-independent
direct detection constraints.",1704.04201v1,hep-ph,2017-04-13 16:24:07+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Fa Peng Huang'), arxiv.Result.Author('Jiang-Hao Yu')]","Phys. Rev. D 98, 095022 (2018)"

577,Peeling off foregrounds with the constrained moment ILC method to unveil primordial CMB $B$-modes,"Galactic foregrounds are the main obstacle to observations of the cosmic
microwave background (CMB) $B$-mode polarization. In addition to obscuring the
inflationary $B$-mode signal by several orders of magnitude, Galactic
foregrounds have non-trivial spectral signatures that are partially unknown and
distorted by averaging effects along the line-of-sight, within the pixel/beam
window, and by various analysis choices (e.g., spherical harmonic transforms
and filters). Statistical moment expansion methods provide a powerful tool for
modeling the effective Galactic foreground emission resulting from these
averaging effects in CMB observations, while blind component separation
treatments can handle unknown foregrounds. In this work, we combine these two
approaches to develop a new semi-blind component separation method at the
intersection of parametric and blind methods, called constrained moment ILC
(cMILC). This method adds several constraints to the standard ILC method to
de-project the main statistical moments of the Galactic foreground emission.
Applications to maps are performed in needlet space and when compared to the
NILC method, this helps significantly reducing residual foreground
contamination (bias, variance, and skewness) in the reconstructed CMB $B$-mode
map, power spectrum, and tensor-to-scalar ratio. We consider sky-simulations
for experimental settings similar to those of LiteBIRD and PICO, illustrating
which trade-offs between residual foreground biases and degradation of the
constraint on $r$ can be expected within the new cMILC framework. We also
outline several directions that require more work in preparation for the coming
analysis challenges.",2006.08628v2,astro-ph.CO,2020-06-15 18:00:02+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Mathieu Remazeilles'), arxiv.Result.Author('Aditya Rotti'), arxiv.Result.Author('Jens Chluba')]",

of this type occupy a part of SUSY parameter space in which collider signatures
are poorly studied. In this paper we will extend previous work on this topic to
include sneutrino NLSP spectra with non-minimal phenomenology. Generally, these
spectra exhibit very leptophilic behavior, which can be easily observed at the
LHC. We show that a variety of such spectra can be analysed with similar
techniques, leading in each case to very suggestive evidence for complicated
decay chains that end in sneutrinos. Amongst the variations considered, we find
a simple class of spectra that produce signals with strong electron-muon
asymmetries. These signals could naively be interpreted as evidence for lepton
flavor violation, but can occur even with flavor-blind SUSY.",1003.5664v2,hep-ph,2010-03-29 20:04:48+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Andrey Katz'), arxiv.Result.Author('Brock Tweedie')]","Phys.Rev.D81:115003,2010"

580,A mixture of experts model for rank data with applications in election studies,"A voting bloc is defined to be a group of voters who have similar voting
preferences. The cleavage of the Irish electorate into voting blocs is of
interest. Irish elections employ a ``single transferable vote'' electoral
system; under this system voters rank some or all of the electoral candidates
in order of preference. These rank votes provide a rich source of preference
information from which inferences about the composition of the electorate may
be drawn. Additionally, the influence of social factors or covariates on the
electorate composition is of interest. A mixture of experts model is a mixture
model in which the model parameters are functions of covariates. A mixture of
experts model for rank data is developed to provide a model-based method to
cluster Irish voters into voting blocs, to examine the influence of social
factors on this clustering and to examine the characteristic preferences of the
voting blocs. The Benter model for rank data is employed as the family of
component densities within the mixture of experts model; generalized linear
model theory is employed to model the influence of covariates on the mixing
proportions. Model fitting is achieved via a hybrid of the EM and MM
algorithms. An example of the methodology is illustrated by examining an Irish
presidential election. The existence of voting blocs in the electorate is
established and it is determined that age and government satisfaction levels
are important factors in influencing voting in this election.",0901.4203v1,stat.AP,2009-01-27 09:16:05+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Isobel Claire Gormley'), arxiv.Result.Author('Thomas Brendan Murphy')]","Annals of Applied Statistics 2008, Vol. 2, No. 4, 1452-1477"

developments in the natural language processing and network science literatures

language, and community detection in multilayer networks, which locates densely
connected actors across multiple, complex networks. We find that the employment
of these tools in tandem helps to better estimate states' foreign policy

application to conflict onset in International Relations, though these tools

identification that, most agree, is best addressed by incorporating
individual-level data into the model. In this paper we test the limits of such
an incorporation by attempting it in the context of drawing inferences about
racial voting patterns using a combination of an exit poll and precinct-level
ecological data; accurate information about racial voting patterns is needed to
assess triggers in voting rights laws that can determine the composition of
United States legislative bodies. Specifically, we extend and study a hybrid
model that addresses two-way tables of arbitrary dimension. We apply the hybrid
model to an exit poll we administered in the City of Boston in 2008. Using the
resulting data as well as simulation, we compare the performance of a pure

588,Strong consensus on US Supreme Court spans a century,"The US Supreme Court throughout the 20th century has been characterized as
being divided between liberals and conservatives, suggesting that justices with
similar ideologies would have voted similarly had they overlapped in tenure.
What if they had? I build an empirical, quantitative model of this
counterfactual hypothesis using pairwise maximum entropy. I infer how 36
justices from 1946-2016 would have all voted on a Super Supreme Court. The
model is strikingly consistent with a standard voting model from political
science despite using $10^5$ less parameters and fitting the observed
statistics better. As with historical courts, the Super Court is dominated by
consensus. The rate at which consensus decays as more justices are included is
extremely slow, nearly 100 years, and indicates that the modern Supreme Court
is an extremely stable institution. Beyond consensus, I discover a rich
structure of dissenting blocs that are distributed along a heavy-tailed Zipf's
law. The heavy tail means that dominant dissenting modes fail to capture the
entire spectrum of dissent. Thus, I find that Supreme Court voting over time is
not low-dimensional despite implications to the contrary in historical analysis
of Supreme Court voting. Although it has been long presumed that strong higher
order correlations are induced by features of the cases, the institution, and
the justices, I show that such complexity can be expressed in a minimal model
relying only on pairwise correlations. From the perspective of model selection,
this minimal model may generalize better and thus be useful for prediction of
Supreme Court voting over time.",1712.09696v2,physics.soc-ph,2017-12-27 22:35:09+00:00,[arxiv.Result.Author('Edward D. Lee')],

that SHIFT BRIBERY tends to be harder in the multiwinner setting than in the
single-winner one by showing settings where SHIFT BRIBERY is easy in the
single-winner cases, but is hard (and hard to approximate) in the multiwinner

there is uncertainty about how others will vote. In this paper, we study
strategic voting when there is uncertainty about the voting method. We
introduce three notions of manipulability for a set of voting methods: sure,
safe, and expected manipulability. With the help of a computer program, we
identify voting scenarios in which uncertainty about the voting method may
reduce or even eliminate a voter's incentive to misrepresent her preferences.
Thus, it may be in the interest of an election designer who wishes to reduce

agents since voting is costly. Misbehaving agents always vote. We compare
conventional voting allowing for abstention with vote delegation. Preferences
of voters are private information and a positive outcome is achieved if
well-behaving agents win. We illustrate that vote delegation leads to quite
different outcomes than conventional voting with abstention. In particular, we
obtain three insights: First, if the number of misbehaving voters, denoted by f
, is high, both voting methods fail to deliver a positive outcome. Second, if f
takes an intermediate value, conventional voting delivers a positive outcome,
while vote delegation fails with probability one. Third, if f is low,
delegation delivers a positive outcome with higher probability than
conventional voting. Finally, our results characterize worst-case outcomes that

elimination style voting rule like single transferable vote, partial voting
does not change the situations where strategic voting is possible. However,
with scoring rules and rules based on the tournament graph, partial voting can
increase the situations where strategic voting is possible. As a consequence,
the computational complexity of computing a strategic vote can change. For
example, with Borda count, the complexity of computing a strategic vote can
decrease or stay the same depending on how we score partial votes.",1405.7714v1,cs.GT,2014-05-28 12:13:52+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Nina Narodytska'), arxiv.Result.Author('Toby Walsh')]",

care about advisors and then about co-advisors (consistent preferences), while
advisors and co-advisors have preferences over students only (hence they are
cooperative). A student must be matched to one advisor and one co-advisor, or

student-co-advisor pairs may not be mutually acceptable (e.g., a student may
not want to work with an advisor or co-advisor and vice versa). We show that
three-sided stable matchings always exist, and present an algorithm that, in
time quadratic in the market size (up to log factors), finds a three-sided
stable matching using any two-sided stable matching algorithm as matching
engine. We illustrate the challenges that arise when not all advisor-co-advisor
pairs are compatible. We then generalize our algorithm to $n$-sided markets

603,A Dynamic Model for Sharing Reputation of Sellers among Buyers for Enhancing Trust in Agent Mediated e-market,"Reputation systems aim to reduce the risk of loss due to untrustworthy
participants. This loss is aggravated by dishonest advisors trying to pollute
the e-market environment for their self-interest. A major task of a reputation
system is to promote and encourage advisors who repeatedly respond with fair
advice and to apply an opinion filtering or honesty checking mechanism to
detect and resist dishonest advisors. This paper provides a dynamic approach to
compute the aggregated shared reputation component by filtering out unfair
advice and then generating the aggregated shared reputation value. The proposed
approach is dynamic in nature as it is sensitive to the behaviour of advisors,
value of the current transaction and encourages the cooperation among buyers as
advisors. It provides incentive to honest advisors in lieu of repeated sharing
of honest opinion by increasing the weight of their opinion and by making the
increase in the reputation of honest advisors monotonically proportional to the
value of a transaction.",1201.3835v1,cs.SI,2012-01-18 16:15:12+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Vibha Gaur'), arxiv.Result.Author('Neeraj Kumar Sharma'), arxiv.Result.Author('Punam Bedi')]",
604,Should Young Computer Scientists Stop Collaborating with their Doctoral Advisors?,"One of the first steps in an academic career, and perhaps the pillar thereof,
is completing a PhD under the supervision of a doctoral advisor. While prior
work has examined the advisor-advisee relationship and its potential effects on
the prospective academic success of the advisee, very little is known on the
possibly continued relationship after the advisee has graduated. We harnessed
three genealogical and scientometric datasets to identify 3 distinct groups of
computer scientists: Highly independent, who cease collaborating with their
advisors (almost) instantly upon graduation; Moderately independent, who
(quickly) reduce the collaboration rate over ~5 years; and Weakly independent
who continue collaborating with their advisors for at least 10 years
post-graduation. We find that highly independent researchers are more
academically successful than their peers in terms of H-index, i10-index and
total number of citations throughout their careers. Moderately independent
researchers perform, on average, better than weakly independent researchers,
yet the differences are not found to be statistically significant. In addition,

process until the point of complete delegation on investment decisions. Surely,
financial advice is potentially a correcting factor in investment decisions

manipulating the expectations of naive investors. In order to give an analytic
formulation of the problem, we present an Agent-Based Model formed by
individual investors and a financial advisor. We parametrize the games by
considering a compromise for the financial advisor (between a sufficient reward
by bank and to keep his/her reputation), and a compromise for the customers
(between the desired return and the proposed return by advisor). Then we obtain
the Nash equilibria and the best response functions of the resulting game. We
also describe the parameter regions in which these points result acceptable
equilibria and the greediness/naivety of the customers emerge naturally from

solve an adaptive mean-variance portfolio optimization problem. The risk-return
tradeoff adapts to the client's risk profile, which depends on idiosyncratic
characteristics, market returns, and economic conditions. We show that the
optimal investment strategy includes both myopic and intertemporal hedging
terms which are impacted by the dynamics of the client's risk profile. We
characterize the optimal portfolio personalization via a tradeoff faced by the
robo-advisor between receiving client information in a timely manner and
mitigating behavioral biases in the risk profile communicated by the client. We
argue that the optimal portfolio's Sharpe ratio and return distribution improve
if the robo-advisor counters the client's tendency to reduce market exposure

favorable.",1911.01391v2,q-fin.PM,2019-11-04 18:25:47+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Agostino Capponi'), arxiv.Result.Author('Sveinn Olafsson'), arxiv.Result.Author('Thaleia Zariphopoulou')]",

incorporated into various discrete actor-critic architectures. The former
component allows the agent to initiatively seek advisor intervention in the
presence of uncertain states, while the latter identifies the unstable states
potentially missed by the former especially when environment changes, and then
learns to promote the ask action on such states. Experimental results on both

620,Limiting Risk by Turning Manifest Phantoms into Evil Zombies,"Drawing a random sample of ballots to conduct a risk-limiting audit generally
requires knowing how the ballots cast in an election are organized into groups,
for instance, how many containers of ballots there are in all and how many
ballots are in each container. A list of the ballot group identifiers along
with number of ballots in each group is called a ballot manifest. What if the
ballot manifest is not accurate? Surprisingly, even if ballots are known to be
missing from the manifest, it is not necessary to make worst-case assumptions
about those ballots--for instance, to adjust the margin by the number of
missing ballots--to ensure that the audit remains conservative. Rather, it
suffices to make worst-case assumptions about the individual randomly selected
ballots that the audit cannot find. This observation provides a simple
modification to some risk-limiting audit procedures that makes them
automatically become more conservative if the ballot manifest has errors. The
modification--phantoms to evil zombies (~2EZ)--requires only an upper bound on
the total number of ballots cast. ~2EZ makes the audit P-value stochastically
larger than it would be had the manifest been accurate, automatically requiring
more than enough ballots to be audited to offset the manifest errors. This
ensures that the true risk limit remains smaller than the nominal risk limit.
On the other hand, if the manifest is in fact accurate and the upper bound on
the total number of ballots equals the total according to the manifest, ~2EZ

contrast, decoy voters are trapped into selling their ballots at a low, or even

626,The ATHENA Class of Risk-Limiting Ballot Polling Audits,"The main risk-limiting ballot polling audit in use today, BRAVO, is designed
for use when single ballots are drawn at random and a decision regarding
whether to stop the audit or draw another ballot is taken after each ballot
draw (ballot-by-ballot (B2) audits). On the other hand, real ballot polling
audits draw many ballots in a single round before determining whether to stop
(round-by-round (R2) audits). We show that BRAVO results in significant
inefficiency when directly applied to real R2 audits. We present the ATHENA
class of R2 stopping rules, which we show are risk-limiting if the round
schedule is pre-determined (before the audit begins). We prove that each rule
is at least as efficient as the corresponding BRAVO stopping rule applied at
the end of the round. We have open-source software libraries implementing most
of our results.
  We show that ATHENA halves the number of ballots required, for all state
margins in the 2016 US Presidential election and a first round with $90\%$
stopping probability, when compared to BRAVO (stopping rule applied at the end
of the round). We present simulation results supporting the 90% stopping
probability claims and our claims for the risk accrued in the first round.
Further, ATHENA reduces the number of ballots by more than a quarter for low
margins, when compared to the BRAVO stopping rule applied on ballots in
selection order. This implies that keeping track of the order when drawing
ballots R2 is not beneficial, because ATHENA is more efficient even without
information on selection order. These results are significant because current
approaches to real ballot polling election audits use the B2 BRAVO rules,
requiring about twice as much work on the part of election officials. Applying
the rules in selection order requires fewer ballots, but keeping track of the

symmetric Dyck tiling ribbon (symDTR). We give two definitions of Hermite

of the correspondence between symDTS operation and an Hermite history. Since
ballot tilings form a subset in the set of symmetric Dyck tilings, we construct

629,Bernoulli Ballot Polling: A Manifest Improvement for Risk-Limiting Audits,"We present a method and software for ballot-polling risk-limiting audits

probability $p$, independently. Bernoulli sampling has several advantages: (1)
it does not require a ballot manifest; (2) it can be conducted independently at
different locations, rather than requiring a central authority to select the
sample from the whole population of cast ballots or requiring stratified
sampling; (3) it can start in polling places on election night, before margins
are known. If the reported margins for the 2016 U.S. Presidential election are
correct, a Bernoulli ballot-polling audit with a risk limit of 5% and a
sampling rate of $p_0 = 1\%$ would have had at least a 99% probability of
confirming the outcome in 42 states. (The other states were more likely to have
needed to examine additional ballots.) Logistical and security advantages that
auditing in the polling place affords may outweigh the cost of examining more

counting mistakes made during audits.
  Moreover, we present and analyze a simple approximate sampling

Our method involves doing $k$ ""cuts"", each involving moving a random portion of
ballots from the top to the bottom of the stack, and then picking the ballot on
top. Unlike conventional methods of picking a ballot at random, $k$-cut does
not require identification numbers on the ballots or counting many ballots per
draw. We analyze how close the distribution of chosen ballots is to the uniform

ballot marking devices (BMDs) is presently the subject of some controversy.
Recent studies (e.g., Bernhard, et al. 2020) suggest the verification rate is
low. What is not clear from previous research is whether this is more a result
of voters being unable to do so accurately or whether this is because voters
simply choose not to attempt verification in the first place. In order to
understand this problem, we conducted an experiment in which 108 participants
participated in a mock election where the BMD displayed the voters' true
choices, but then changed a subset of those choices on the printed ballot. The
design of the printed ballot, the length of the ballot, the number of changes
that were made to the ballot, the location of those changes, and the
instructions provided to the voters were manipulated as part of the experiment.
Results indicated that of those voters who chose to examine the printed ballot,
76% detected anomalies, indicating that voters can reliably detect errors on
their ballot if they will simply review it. This suggests that administrative

justifiably high confidence that the reported results of an election are
consistent with an audit trail (""ballots""), which can be paper or electronic.
SOBA combines three ideas: (1) publishing cast vote records (CVRs) separately
for each contest, so that anyone can verify that each reported contest outcome
is correct, if the CVRs reflect voters' intentions with sufficient accuracy;
(2) shrouding a mapping between ballots and the CVRs for those ballots to
prevent the loss of privacy that could occur otherwise; (3) assessing the
accuracy with which the CVRs reflect voters' intentions for a collection of
contests while simultaneously assessing the integrity of the shrouded mapping
between ballots and CVRs by comparing randomly selected ballots to the CVRs
that purport to represent them. Step (1) is related to work by the Humboldt
County Election Transparency Project, but publishing CVRs separately for
individual contests rather than images of entire ballots preserves privacy.
Step (2) requires a cryptographic commitment from elections officials.
Observers participate in step (3), which relies on the ""super-simple
simultaneous single-ballot risk-limiting audit."" Step (3) is designed to reveal
relatively few ballots if the shrouded mapping is proper and the CVRs
accurately reflect voter intent. But if the reported outcomes of the contests

incorrect election results, independent of why the result was incorrect.
Ballot-polling audits select ballots at random and interpret those ballots as
evidence for and against the reported result, continuing this process until
either they support the recorded result, or they fall back to a full manual
recount. For elections with digitised scanning and counting of ballots, a
comparison audit compares randomly selected digital ballots with their paper
versions. Discrepancies are referred to as errors, and are used to build
evidence against or in support of the recorded result. Risk-limiting audits for
first-past-the-post elections are well understood, and used in some US
elections. We define a number of approaches to ballot-polling and comparison
risk-limiting audits for Instant Runoff Voting (IRV) elections. We show that
for almost all real elections we found, we can perform a risk-limiting audit by
looking at only a small fraction of the total ballots (assuming no errors were

traditional plurality voting in which voters submit rankings over the

on their ballot. We theoretically and empirically analyze how ballot length can
influence the outcome of an election, given fixed voter preferences. We show
that there exist preference profiles over $k$ candidates such that up to $k-1$
different candidates win at different ballot lengths. We derive exact lower
bounds on the number of voters required for such profiles and provide a
construction matching the lower bound for unrestricted voter preferences.
Additionally, we characterize which sequences of winners are possible over
ballot lengths and provide explicit profile constructions achieving any
feasible winner sequence. We also examine how classic preference restrictions
influence our results--for instance, single-peakedness makes $k-1$ different
winners impossible but still allows at least $\Omega(\sqrt k)$. Finally, we
analyze a collection of 168 real-world elections, where we truncate rankings to
simulate shorter ballots. We find that shorter ballots could have changed the
outcome in one quarter of these elections. Our results highlight ballot length

637,Modeling Voters in Multi-Winner Approval Voting,"In many real world situations, collective decisions are made using voting
and, in scenarios such as committee or board elections, employing voting rules
that return multiple winners. In multi-winner approval voting (AV), an agent
submits a ballot consisting of approvals for as many candidates as they wish,
and winners are chosen by tallying up the votes and choosing the top-$k$
candidates receiving the most approvals. In many scenarios, an agent may
manipulate the ballot they submit in order to achieve a better outcome by
voting in a way that does not reflect their true preferences. In complex and
uncertain situations, agents may use heuristics instead of incurring the
additional effort required to compute the manipulation which most favors them.
In this paper, we examine voting behavior in single-winner and multi-winner
approval voting scenarios with varying degrees of uncertainty using behavioral
data obtained from Mechanical Turk. We find that people generally manipulate
their vote to obtain a better outcome, but often do not identify the optimal
manipulation. There are a number of predictive models of agent behavior in the
COMSOC and psychology literature that are based on cognitively plausible
heuristic strategies. We show that the existing approaches do not adequately
model real-world data. We propose a novel model that takes into account the
size of the winning set and human cognitive constraints, and demonstrate that

insufficient in several real scenarios because the passengers are not separated
strictly into groups. In this paper, we propose a boarding strategy that

654,Interpretable Almost-Matching-Exactly With Instrumental Variables,"Uncertainty in the estimation of the causal effect in observational studies
is often due to unmeasured confounding, i.e., the presence of unobserved

for IV estimation either require strong parametric assumptions, use arbitrary
distance metrics, or do not scale well to large datasets. We propose a matching
framework for IV in the presence of observed categorical confounders that
addresses these weaknesses. Our method first matches units exactly, and then
consecutively drops variables to approximately match the remaining units on as
many variables as possible. We show that our algorithm constructs better
matches than other existing methods on simulated datasets, and we produce

655,Notes on solving and playing peg solitaire on a computer,"We consider the one-person game of peg solitaire played on a computer. Two
popular board shapes are the 33-hole cross-shaped board, and the 15-hole
triangle board---we use them as examples throughout. The basic game begins from
a full board with one peg missing and the goal is to finish at a board position
with one peg. First, we discuss ways to solve the basic game on a computer.
Then we consider the problem of quickly distinguishing board positions where
the goal can still be reached (""winning"" board positions) from those where it
cannot. This enables a computer to alert the player if a jump under
consideration leads to a dead end. On the 15-hole triangle board, it is
possible to identify all winning board positions (from any single vacancy
start) by storing a key set of 437 board positions. For the ""central game"" on
the 33-hole cross-shaped board, we can identify all winning board positions by
storing 839,536 board positions. By viewing a successful game as a traversal of
a directed graph of winning board positions, we apply a simple algorithm to
count the number of ways to traverse this graph, and calculate that the total
number of solutions to the central game is 40,861,647,040,079,968. Our analysis
can also determine how quickly we can reach a ""dead board position"", where a

Some key radical technologies in 6G together with existing 5G candidate schemes
will guarantee the expected quality of experience (QoE) to attain ubiquitous
wireless connectivity for the Internet of Everything (IoE) ranging from the

658,Is Task Board Customization Beneficial? - An Eye Tracking Study,"The task board is an essential artifact in many agile development approaches.
It provides a good overview of the project status. Teams often customize their
task boards according to the team members' needs. They modify the structure of
boards, define colored codings for different purposes, and introduce different
card sizes. Although the customizations are intended to improve the task
board's usability and effectiveness, they may also complicate its comprehension
and use. The increased effort impedes the work of both the team and team
externals. Hence, task board customization is in conflict with the agile
practice of fast and easy overview for everyone. In an eye tracking study with
30 participants, we compared an original task board design with three
customized ones to investigate which design shortened the required time to
identify a particular story card. Our findings yield that only the customized
task board design with modified structures reduces the required time. The
original task board design is more beneficial than individual colored codings
and changed card sizes. According to our findings, agile teams should rethink
their current task board design. They may be better served by focusing on the
original task board design and by applying only carefully selected adjustments.
In case of customization, a task board's structure should be adjusted since
this is the only beneficial kind of customization, that additionally complies

extraterrestrial civilizations may use free-floating planets as interstellar
transportation for space exploration and interstellar colonization. Large
groups or populations of their biological species, post-biological species, and
technologies may become Cosmic Hitchhikers when they ride free-floating planets
to reach, explore and colonize planetary systems. To get an interstellar ride,
Cosmic Hitchhikers may travel to free-floating planets passing close by their
home worlds. Otherwise, they may use astronomical engineering to steer
free-floating planets toward their home planetary systems. Cosmic Hitchhikers
may also ride objects native to the outer regions of their planetary systems,
which become free-floating planets when ejected by astronomical engineering or
by their stars during the asymptotic giant branch evolution. During
interstellar travel, Cosmic Hitchhikers may apply astronomical engineering to
steer their free-floating planets toward the planetary systems of their choice.
Whereas riding free-floating planets may not save travel time, it avoids the
technical challenges of interstellar spacecraft transporting large populations.
Each civilization of Cosmic Hitchhikers may colonize several planetary systems.
Its colonies may grow into autonomous civilizations, changing the number of
civilizations in the Galaxy. Over the last 4 billion years, Cosmic Hitchhikers
or their artifacts riding free-floating planets might have passed by the Solar
System. Therefore, their artifacts might exist in the Solar System or in our

666,"SETI, evolution and human history merged into a mathematical model","In this paper we propose a new mathematical model capable of merging
Darwinian Evolution, Human History and SETI into a single mathematical scheme:
1) Darwinian Evolution over the last 3.5 billion years is defined as one
particular realization of a certain stochastic process called Geometric
Brownian Motion (GBM). This GBM yields the fluctuations in time of the number
of species living on Earth. Its mean value curve is an increasing exponential
curve, i.e. the exponential growth of Evolution. 2) In 2008 this author
provided the statistical generalization of the Drake equation yielding the
number N of communicating ET civilizations in the Galaxy. N was shown to follow
the lognormal probability distribution. 3) We call ""b-lognormals"" those
lognormals starting at any positive time b (""birth"") larger than zero. Then the
exponential growth curve becomes the geometric locus of the peaks of a
one-parameter family of b-lognormals: this is our way to re-define Cladistics.
4) b-lognormals may be also be interpreted as the lifespan of any living being
(a cell, or an animal, a plant, a human, or even the historic lifetime of any
civilization). Applying this new mathematical apparatus to Human History, leads
to the discovery of the exponential progress between Ancient Greece and the
current USA as the envelope of all b-lognormals of Western Civilizations over a
period of 2500 years. 5) We then invoke Shannon's Information Theory. The
b-lognormals' entropy turns out to be the index of ""development level"" reached
by each historic civilization. We thus get a numerical estimate of the entropy
difference between any two civilizations, like the Aztec-Spaniard difference in
1519. 6) In conclusion, we have derived a mathematical scheme capable of
estimating how much more advanced than Humans an Alien Civilization will be

experimented not only with free-market trade zones, but with allowing
non-profit foundations to operate in a decentralized fashion. A network study
shows how these foundations have connected together by sharing board members,
in a structural parallel to what is seen in corporations in the United States

with privileged network positions. While the presence of government officials
on non-profit boards is widespread, government officials are much less common
in a subgroup of foundations that control just over half of all revenue in the
network. This subgroup, associated with business elites, not only enjoys higher
levels of within-elite links, but even preferentially excludes government
officials from the NGOs with higher degree. The emergence of this structurally
autonomous sphere is associated with major political and social events in the
state-society relationship. Cluster analysis reveals multiple internal
components within this sphere that share similar levels of network influence.
Rather than a core-periphery structure centered around government officials,

paper presents a two-parameter model for civilizational lifespans, i.e. the

lethality of a civilization's biotechnology and the other characterizes the

inform the biotechnology parameter, the model predicts human civilization's
median survival time as decades to centuries, even with optimistic
psychosociological parameter values, thereby positioning biotechnology as a
proximate threat to human civilization. For an ensemble of civilizations having
some median calculated survival time, the model predicts that, after 80 times
that duration, only one in $10^{24}$ civilizations will survive -- a tempo and
degree of winnowing compatible with Hanson's ""Great Filter."" Thus, assuming

672,A Peered Bulletin Board for Robust Use in Verifiable Voting Systems,"The Web Bulletin Board (WBB) is a key component of verifiable election
systems. It is used in the context of election verification to publish evidence
of voting and tallying that voters and officials can check, and where
challenges can be launched in the event of malfeasance. In practice, the
election authority has responsibility for implementing the web bulletin board
correctly and reliably, and will wish to ensure that it behaves correctly even
in the presence of failures and attacks. To ensure robustness, an
implementation will typically use a number of peers to be able to provide a
correct service even when some peers go down or behave dishonestly. In this
paper we propose a new protocol to implement such a Web Bulletin Board,
motivated by the needs of the vVote verifiable voting system. Using a
distributed algorithm increases the complexity of the protocol and requires
careful reasoning in order to establish correctness. Here we use the Event-B
modelling and refinement approach to establish correctness of the peered design
against an idealised specification of the bulletin board behaviour. In
particular we show that for n peers, a threshold of t > 2n/3 peers behaving
correctly is sufficient to ensure correct behaviour of the bulletin board
distributed design. The algorithm also behaves correctly even if honest or
dishonest peers temporarily drop out of the protocol and then return. The
verification approach also establishes that the protocols used within the
bulletin board do not interfere with each other. This is the first time a
peered web bulletin board suite of protocols has been formally verified.",1401.4151v1,cs.CR,2014-01-16 20:11:42+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Chris Culnane'), arxiv.Result.Author('Steve Schneider')]",

677,Multi-LexSum: Real-World Summaries of Civil Rights Lawsuits at Multiple Granularities,"With the advent of large language models, methods for abstractive
summarization have made great strides, creating potential for use in
applications to aid knowledge workers processing unwieldy document collections.
One such setting is the Civil Rights Litigation Clearinghouse (CRLC)
(https://clearinghouse.net),which posts information about large-scale civil
rights lawsuits, serving lawyers, scholars, and the general public. Today,
summarization in the CRLC requires extensive training of lawyers and law
students who spend hours per case understanding multiple relevant documents in
order to produce high-quality summaries of key events and outcomes. Motivated
by this ongoing real-world summarization effort, we introduce Multi-LexSum, a
collection of 9,280 expert-authored summaries drawn from ongoing CRLC writing.
Multi-LexSum presents a challenging multi-document summarization task given the
length of the source documents, often exceeding two hundred pages per case.
Furthermore, Multi-LexSum is distinct from other datasets in its multiple
target summaries, each at a different granularity (ranging from one-sentence
""extreme"" summaries to multi-paragraph narrations of over five hundred words).
We present extensive analysis demonstrating that despite the high-quality
summaries in the training data (adhering to strict content and style
guidelines), state-of-the-art summarization models perform poorly on this task.
We release Multi-LexSum for further research in summarization methods as well
as to facilitate development of applications to assist in the CRLC's mission at

678,MAD with Aliens? Interstellar deterrence and its implications,"The possibility that extraterrestrial intelligences (ETIs) could be hostile
to humanity has been raised as a reason to avoid even trying to contact ETIs.
However, there is a distinct shortage of analytical discussion about the risks
of an attack, perhaps because of an implicit premise that we cannot analyze the
decision making of an alien civilization. This paper argues that we can draw
some inferences from the history of the Cold War and nuclear deterrence in
order to show that at least some attack scenarios are likely to be exaggerated.
In particular, it would seem to be unlikely that the humanity would be attacked
simply because it might, some time in the future, present a threat to the ETI.
Even if communication proves to be difficult, rational decision-makers should
avoid unprovoked attacks, because their success would be very difficult to
assure. In general, it seems believable that interstellar conflicts between
civilizations would remain rare. The findings advise caution for proposed
interstellar missions, however, as starfaring capability itself might be seen
as a threat. On the other hand, attempting to contact ETIs seems to be a
relatively low-risk strategy: paranoid ETIs must also consider the possibility
that the messages are a deception designed to lure out hostile civilizations
and preemptively destroy them.",1302.0606v1,physics.pop-ph,2013-02-04 08:00:17+00:00,[arxiv.Result.Author('Janne M. Korhonen')],

development. A macro-model of civilization that accounts for the effect of
knowledge production on population, energy consumption and environmental
conditions is developed. The model includes dynamic equations for world
population, amount of knowledge circulating in civilization, the share of
fossil fuels in total energy consumption, atmospheric CO2 concentration, and
global mean surface temperature. Energy dissipation in knowledge production and
direct loss of knowledge are taken into account. The model is calibrated using
historical data for each variable. About 90 scenarios were calculated. It was
shown that there are two control parameters - sensitivity of the population to
temperature rise and coefficient of knowledge loss - which determine the future
of civilization. In the two-dimensional space of these parameters, there is an
area of sustainable development and an area of loss of stability. Calculations
show that civilization is located just on the critical curve separating these
areas, that is, at the edge of stability. A small deviation can ultimately lead
either to a steady state of 10+ billion people or to the complete extinction of
civilization. There are no intermediate steady states.",2002.10196v1,physics.soc-ph,2020-02-24 12:25:15+00:00,[arxiv.Result.Author('Boris M. Dolgonosov')],
680,A Peered Bulletin Board for Robust Use in Verifiable Voting Systems,"The Web Bulletin Board (WBB) is a key component of verifiable election
systems. It is used in the context of election verification to publish evidence
of voting and tallying that voters and officials can check, and where
challenges can be launched in the event of malfeasance. In practice, the
election authority has responsibility for implementing the web bulletin board
correctly and reliably, and will wish to ensure that it behaves correctly even
in the presence of failures and attacks. To ensure robustness, an
implementation will typically use a number of peers to be able to provide a
correct service even when some peers go down or behave dishonestly. In this
paper we propose a new protocol to implement such a Web Bulletin Board,
motivated by the needs of the vVote verifiable voting system. Using a
distributed algorithm increases the complexity of the protocol and requires
careful reasoning in order to establish correctness. Here we use the Event-B
modelling and refinement approach to establish correctness of the peered design
against an idealised specification of the bulletin board behaviour. In
particular we show that for n peers, a threshold of t > 2n/3 peers behaving
correctly is sufficient to ensure correct behaviour of the bulletin board
distributed design. The algorithm also behaves correctly even if honest or
dishonest peers temporarily drop out of the protocol and then return. The
verification approach also establishes that the protocols used within the
bulletin board do not interfere with each other. This is the first time a
peered web bulletin board suite of protocols has been formally verified.",1401.4151v1,cs.CR,2014-01-16 20:11:42+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Chris Culnane'), arxiv.Result.Author('Steve Schneider')]",

considered the scenario that the irregular counting of these votes might have

689,Identifying Possible Winners in Ranked Choice Voting Elections with Outstanding Ballots,"Several election districts in the US have recently moved to ranked-choice
voting (RCV) to decide the results of local elections. RCV allows voters to
rank their choices, and the results are computed in rounds, eliminating one
candidate at a time. RCV ensures fairer elections and has been shown to
increase elected representation of women and people of color. A main drawback
of RCV is that the round-by-round process requires all the ballots to be
tallied before the results of an election can be calculated. With increasingly
large portions of ballots coming from absentee voters, RCV election outcomes
are not always apparent on election night, and can take several weeks to be
published, leading to a loss of trust in the electoral process from the public.
In this paper, we present an algorithm for efficiently computing possible
winners of RCV elections from partially known ballots and evaluate it on data
from the recent New York City Primary elections. We show that our techniques

693,Quota-based debiasing can decrease representation of already underrepresented groups,"Many important decisions in societies such as school admissions, hiring, or
elections are based on the selection of top-ranking individuals from a larger
pool of candidates. This process is often subject to biases, which typically
manifest as an under-representation of certain groups among the selected or
accepted individuals. The most common approach to this issue is debiasing, for
example via the introduction of quotas that ensure proportional representation
of groups with respect to a certain, often binary attribute. Cases include
quotas for women on corporate boards or ethnic quotas in elections. This,
however, has the potential to induce changes in representation with respect to
other attributes. For the case of two correlated binary attributes we show that
quota-based debiasing based on a single attribute can worsen the representation
of already underrepresented groups and decrease overall fairness of selection.
We use several data sets from a broad range of domains from recidivism risk
assessments to scientific citations to assess this effect in real-world
settings. Our results demonstrate the importance of including all relevant
attributes in debiasing procedures and that more efforts need to be put into
eliminating the root causes of inequalities as purely numerical solutions such
as quota-based debiasing might lead to unintended consequences.",2006.07647v1,cs.CY,2020-06-13 14:26:42+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Ivan Smirnov'), arxiv.Result.Author('Florian Lemmerich'), arxiv.Result.Author('Markus Strohmaier')]",

697,The Price of Political Uncertainty: Evidence from the 2016 U.S. Presidential Election and the U.S. Stock Markets,"There is bountiful evidence that political uncertainty stemming from
presidential elections or doubt about the direction of future policy make
financial markets significantly volatile, especially in proximity to close
elections or elections that may prompt radical policy changes. Although several
studies have examined the association between presidential elections and stock
returns, very little attention has been given to the impacts of elections and
election induced uncertainty on stock markets. This paper explores, at sectoral
level, the uncertain information hypothesis (UIH) as a means of explaining the
reaction of markets to the arrival of unanticipated information. This
hypothesis postulates that political uncertainty is greater prior to the
elections (relative to pre-election period) but is resolved once the outcome of
the elections is determined (relative to post-election period). To this end, we
adopt an event-study methodology that examines abnormal return behavior around
the election date. We show that collapsing stock returns around the election
result is reversed by positive abnormal return on the next day, except some
cases where we note negative responses following the vote count. Although
Trump's win plunges US into uncertain future, positive reactions of abnormal
return are found. Therefore, our results do not support the UIH hypothesis.
Besides, the effect of political uncertainty is sector-specific. While some
sectors emerged winners (healthcare, oil and gas, real estate, defense,
financials and consumer goods and services), others took the opposite route
(technology and utilities). The winning industries are generally those that
will benefit from the new administration's focus on rebuilding infrastructure,

challenges can be launched in the event of malfeasance. In practice, the
election authority has responsibility for implementing the web bulletin board
correctly and reliably, and will wish to ensure that it behaves correctly even
in the presence of failures and attacks. To ensure robustness, an
implementation will typically use a number of peers to be able to provide a
correct service even when some peers go down or behave dishonestly. In this
paper we propose a new protocol to implement such a Web Bulletin Board,
motivated by the needs of the vVote verifiable voting system. Using a
distributed algorithm increases the complexity of the protocol and requires
careful reasoning in order to establish correctness. Here we use the Event-B
modelling and refinement approach to establish correctness of the peered design
against an idealised specification of the bulletin board behaviour. In
particular we show that for n peers, a threshold of t > 2n/3 peers behaving
correctly is sufficient to ensure correct behaviour of the bulletin board
distributed design. The algorithm also behaves correctly even if honest or
dishonest peers temporarily drop out of the protocol and then return. The
verification approach also establishes that the protocols used within the
bulletin board do not interfere with each other. This is the first time a
peered web bulletin board suite of protocols has been formally verified.",1401.4151v1,cs.CR,2014-01-16 20:11:42+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Chris Culnane'), arxiv.Result.Author('Steve Schneider')]",

supervisor with a reduced number of states in discrete-event systems. The main

supervisor, constructed by the proposed method in [9], preserves the
observation properties, i.e. normality and relative observability, by self
looping corresponding unobservable events at some states of the reduced

distributed control of discrete-event systems (DES) with finite behavior. Its
essence is the allocation of monolithic (global) control action among the local
control strategies of individual agents. In this report, we extend supervisor
localization to study the distributed control of DES with infinite behavior.
Specifically, we first employ Thistle and Wonham's supervisory control theory
for DES with infinite behavior to compute a safety supervisor (for safety
specifications) and a liveness supervisor (for liveness specifications), and
then design a suitable localization procedure to decompose the safety
supervisor into a set of safety local controllers, one for each controllable
event, and decompose the liveness supervisor into a set of liveness local
controllers, two for each controllable event. The localization procedure for
decomposing the liveness supervisor is novel; in particular, a local controller
is responsible for disabling the corresponding controllable event on only part
of the states of the liveness supervisor, and consequently, the derived local
controller in general has states number no more than that computed by
considering the disablement on all the states. Moreover, we prove that the
derived local controllers achieve the same controlled behavior with the safety
and liveness supervisors. We finally illustrate the result by a Small Factory
example.",1710.08751v1,cs.SY,2017-10-24 13:16:54+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Renyuan Zhang'), arxiv.Result.Author('Kai Cai')]",

supervisor, for collision avoidance of multiple human-driven vehicles at a road
intersection, considering measurement errors, unmodeled dynamics, and
uncontrolled vehicles. We design the supervisor to be least restrictive, that
is, to minimize its interferences with human drivers. This performance metric
is given a precise mathematical form by splitting the design process into two
subproblems: verification problem and supervisor-design problem. The
verification problem determines whether an input signal exists that makes
controlled vehicles avoid collisions at all future times. The supervisor is
designed such that if the verification problem returns yes, it allows the
drivers' desired inputs; otherwise, it overrides controlled vehicles to prevent
collisions. As a result, we propose exact and efficient supervisors. The exact
supervisor solves the verification problem exactly but with combinatorial
complexity. In contrast, the efficient supervisor solves the verification
problem within a quantified approximation bound in polynomially bounded time
with the number of controlled vehicles. We validate the performances of both
supervisors through simulation and experimental testing.",1603.03916v2,cs.SY,2016-03-12 14:02:10+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Heejin Ahn'), arxiv.Result.Author('Andrea Rizzi'), arxiv.Result.Author('Alessandro Colombo'), arxiv.Result.Author('Domitilla Del Vecchio')]",

708,What Information Really Matters in Supervisor Reduction?,"To make a supervisor comprehensible to a layman has been a long-lasting goal
in the supervisory control community. One strategy is to reduce the size of a
supervisor to generate a control equivalent version, whose size is hopefully
much smaller than the original one so that a user or control designer can
easily check whether a designed controller fulfils its objectives and
requirements. After the first journal paper on this topic appeared in 1986 by
Vaz and Wonham, which relied on the concept of control covers, in 2004 Su and
Wonham proposed to use control congruences to ensure computational viability.
This work is later adopted in the supervisor localization theory, which aims
for a control equivalent distributed implementation of a given centralized
supervisor. But after so many publications, some fundamental questions, which
should have been addressed in the first place, have not been answered yet,
namely what information is critical to ensure control equivalence, what
information is responsible for size reduction, and whether the partial
observation really makes things different. In this paper we will address these
fundamental questions by showing that there does exist a unified supervisor
reduction theory, which is applicable to all feasible supervisors regardless of
whether they are under full observation or partial observation. Our theory
provides a partial order over all control equivalent feasible supervisors based
on their enabling, disabling and marking information, which can be used to
categorize the corresponding reduction rates. Based on this result we can see
that, given two control equivalent feasible supervisors, the one under full
observation can always result in a reduced supervisor no bigger than that

attacker can eavesdrop the control commands issued by the supervisor. We
propose a method to obfuscate an (insecure) supervisor to make it resilient
against actuator enablement attack in such a way that the behavior of the
original closed-loop system is preserved. An additional feature of the
obfuscated supervisor, if it exists, is that it has exactly the minimum number
of states among the set of all the resilient and behavior-preserving
supervisors. Our approach involves a simple combination of two basic ideas: 1)
a formulation of the problem of computing behavior-preserving supervisors as
the problem of computing separating finite state automata under controllability
and observability constraints, which can be efficiently tackled by using modern
SAT solvers, and 2) the use of a recently proposed technique for the
verification of attackability in our setting, with a normality assumption
imposed on both the actuator attackers and supervisors.",1811.02932v2,cs.SY,2018-11-07 15:27:04+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Yuting Zhu'), arxiv.Result.Author('Liyong Lin'), arxiv.Result.Author('Rong Su')]",

suitable localization procedure to decompose the supervisor into a set of local
controllers. In the resulting local controllers, only observable events can
cause state change. Further, to deal with large-scale systems, we combine the

First, we employ timed relative observability to synthesize a

supervisor include not only disabling action of prohibitible events (as that of
controllable events in the untimed case) but also ""clock-preempting"" action of
forcible events. Accordingly we decompose the supervisor into a set of
partial-observation local controllers one for each prohibitible event, as well
as a set of partial-observation local preemptors one for each forcible event.
We prove that these local controllers and preemptors collectively achieve the
same controlled behavior as the partial-observation monolithic supervisor does.
Moreover, we propose channel models for inter-agent event communication and
impose bounded and unbounded delay as temporal specifications. In this
formulation, there exist multiple distinct observable event sets; thus we
employ timed relative coobservability to synthesize partial-observation
decentralized supervisors, and then localize these supervisors into local
controllers and preemptors. The above results are illustrated by a timed
workcell example.",1603.02023v3,cs.SY,2016-03-07 12:13:34+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Renyuan Zhang'), arxiv.Result.Author('Kai Cai')]",

coordinators. Then we localize each of these supervisors/coordinators into

reduced supervisor to each local controller. Although event reduction is an
important property, the original supervisor localization procedure did not
guarantee event reduction in each local controller comparing to the reduced
supervisor. In this paper, we propose a method to localize a supervisor with

Ethical discussion regarding the use of crowdworkers within the NLP research
community is typically confined in scope to issues related to labor conditions
such as fair pay. We draw attention to the lack of ethical considerations
related to the various tasks performed by workers, including labeling,
evaluation, and production. We find that the Final Rule, the common ethical
framework used by researchers, did not anticipate the use of online
crowdsourcing platforms for data collection, resulting in gaps between the
spirit and practice of human-subjects ethics in NLP research. We enumerate
common scenarios where crowdworkers performing NLP tasks are at risk of harm.
We thus recommend that researchers evaluate these risks by considering the
three ethical principles set up by the Belmont Report. We also clarify some
common misconceptions regarding the Institutional Review Board (IRB)
application. We hope this paper will serve to reopen the discussion within our
community regarding the ethical use of crowdworkers.",2104.10097v1,cs.CL,2021-04-20 16:30:59+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Boaz Shmueli'), arxiv.Result.Author('Jan Fell'), arxiv.Result.Author('Soumya Ray'), arxiv.Result.Author('Lun-Wei Ku')]",
725,A Peered Bulletin Board for Robust Use in Verifiable Voting Systems,"The Web Bulletin Board (WBB) is a key component of verifiable election
systems. It is used in the context of election verification to publish evidence
of voting and tallying that voters and officials can check, and where
challenges can be launched in the event of malfeasance. In practice, the
election authority has responsibility for implementing the web bulletin board
correctly and reliably, and will wish to ensure that it behaves correctly even
in the presence of failures and attacks. To ensure robustness, an
implementation will typically use a number of peers to be able to provide a
correct service even when some peers go down or behave dishonestly. In this
paper we propose a new protocol to implement such a Web Bulletin Board,
motivated by the needs of the vVote verifiable voting system. Using a
distributed algorithm increases the complexity of the protocol and requires
careful reasoning in order to establish correctness. Here we use the Event-B
modelling and refinement approach to establish correctness of the peered design
against an idealised specification of the bulletin board behaviour. In
particular we show that for n peers, a threshold of t > 2n/3 peers behaving
correctly is sufficient to ensure correct behaviour of the bulletin board
distributed design. The algorithm also behaves correctly even if honest or
dishonest peers temporarily drop out of the protocol and then return. The
verification approach also establishes that the protocols used within the
bulletin board do not interfere with each other. This is the first time a
peered web bulletin board suite of protocols has been formally verified.",1401.4151v1,cs.CR,2014-01-16 20:11:42+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Chris Culnane'), arxiv.Result.Author('Steve Schneider')]",

the COVID-19 pandemic and the growing demand for online courses. Online exam
proctoring technologies purport to provide effective oversight of students
sitting online exams, using artificial intelligence (AI) systems and human

alarmed some students who see them as `Big Brother-like', yet some universities
defend their judicious use. Critical ethical appraisal of online proctoring
technologies is overdue. This article philosophically analyzes these
technologies, focusing on the ethical concepts of academic integrity, fairness,
non-maleficence, transparency, privacy, respect for autonomy, liberty, and
trust. Most of these concepts are prominent in the new field of AI ethics and
all are relevant to the education context. The essay provides ethical

728,The Long Arc of Fairness: Formalisations and Ethical Discourse,"In recent years, the idea of formalising and modelling fairness for
algorithmic decision making (ADM) has advanced to a point of sophisticated
specialisation. However, the relations between technical (formalised) and
ethical discourse on fairness are not always clear and productive. Arguing for
an alternative perspective, we review existing fairness metrics and discuss
some common issues. For instance, the fairness of procedures and distributions
is often formalised and discussed statically, disregarding both structural
preconditions of the status quo and downstream effects of a given intervention.
We then introduce dynamic fairness modelling, a more comprehensive approach
that realigns formal fairness metrics with arguments from the ethical
discourse. A dynamic fairness model incorporates (1) ethical goals, (2) formal
metrics to quantify decision procedures and outcomes and (3) mid-term or
long-term downstream effects. By contextualising these elements of
fairness-related processes, dynamic fairness modelling explicates formerly
latent ethical aspects and thereby provides a helpful tool to navigate
trade-offs between different fairness interventions. To illustrate the
framework, we discuss an example application -- the current European efforts to
increase the number of women on company boards, e.g. via quota solutions -- and
present early technical work that fits within our framework.",2203.06038v1,cs.LG,2022-03-08 09:54:59+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Pola Schwöbel'), arxiv.Result.Author('Peter Remmers')]",

Critical and Interdisciplinary Perspectives"". In response to recent
controversies about the harms of digital technology, discourses and practices
of ""tech ethics"" have proliferated across the tech industry, academia, civil
society, and government. Yet despite the seeming promise of ethics, tech ethics
in practice suffers from several significant limitations: tech ethics is vague
and toothless, has a myopic focus on individual engineers and technology
design, and is subsumed into corporate logics and incentives. These limitations
suggest that tech ethics enables corporate ""ethics-washing"": embracing the
language of ethics to defuse criticism and resist government regulation,
without committing to ethical behavior. Given these dynamics, I describe tech
ethics as a terrain of contestation where the central debate is not whether
ethics is desirable, but what ""ethics"" entails and who gets to define it.
Current approaches to tech ethics are poised to enable technologists and
technology companies to label themselves as ""ethical"" without substantively
altering their practices. Thus, those striving for structural improvements in
digital technologies must be mindful of the gap between ethics as a mode of
normative inquiry and ethics as a practical endeavor. In order to better
evaluate the opportunities and limits of tech ethics, I propose a
sociotechnical approach that analyzes tech ethics in light of who defines it

subjects rather than harms to human society. In response, we have developed the
Ethics and Society Review board (ESR), a feedback panel that works with
researchers to mitigate negative ethical and societal aspects of AI research.
The ESR's main insight is to serve as a requirement for funding: researchers
cannot receive grant funding from a major AI funding program at our university
until the researchers complete the ESR process for the proposal. In this
article, we describe the ESR as we have designed and run it over its first year

groups, inclusion of diverse stakeholders in the research plan, dual use, and
representation in data. Surveys and interviews of researchers who interacted

734,"D-DEMOS: A distributed, end-to-end verifiable, internet voting system","E-voting systems have emerged as a powerful technology for improving
democracy by reducing election cost, increasing voter participation, and even
allowing voters to directly verify the entire election procedure. Prior
internet voting systems have single points of failure, which may result in the
compromise of availability, voter secrecy, or integrity of the election
results. In this paper, we present the design, implementation, security

distributed, privacy-preserving and end-to-end verifiable. Our system includes
a fully asynchronous vote collection subsystem that provides immediate
assurance to the voter her vote was recorded as cast, without requiring
cryptographic operations on behalf of the voter. We also include a distributed,

individuals who control election result production while guaranteeing privacy

system is the first e-voting system whose voting operation is human verifiable,
i.e., a voter can vote over the web, even when her web client stack is
potentially unsafe, without sacrificing her privacy, and still be assured her
vote was recorded as cast. Additionally, a voter can outsource election
auditing to third parties, still without sacrificing privacy. Finally, as the

takes too much time to release the result, given that the College has limited
personnel. Thus, the proponents developed the Dynamic Local Area Network (LAN)
Based Mock Board Examination System that makes the preparation and checking
easy.
  Method-The proponents followed the iterative waterfall model to develop the
system efficiently. Some criteria of ISO 25010 were adopted in the evaluation
instrument. Simultaneously, evaluators are composed of program chairperson,
College of Computer Studies (CCS) faculty, board program students, and alumni.
  Results-The result of 4.91 in Functional Suitability, 4.87 in Performance
Efficiency, 4.91 in Usability, 4.90 in Security, and 4.92 in Maintainability
shows that the system is fully functional and is usable by any board program.
  Conclusion The computer-based examination, implemented through LAN, can
simplify administering personnel of MinSCAT mock board examination. The
development of the ""Dynamic LAN Based Mock Board Examination System"" is a great
help to the MinSCAT and their board program graduates if it is implemented.
  Recommendations-The system has hidden weaknesses that were only identified in
actual operation. Thus, further testing is needed, like beta testing, to
identify and correct it for better performance. After beta-testing, the system
can be improved through iteration of the Waterfall Model phases.
  Research Implications-The developed system can improve the mock board

742,From Bad to Worse: Airline Boarding Changes in Response to COVID-19,"Airlines have introduced a back-to-front boarding process in response to the
COVID-19 pandemic. It is motivated by the desire to reduce passengers'
likelihood of passing close to seated passengers when they take their seats.
However, our prior work on the risk of Ebola spread in airplanes suggested that
the driving force for increased exposure to infection transmission risk is the
clustering of passengers while waiting for others to stow their luggage and
take their seats. In this work, we examine whether the new boarding processes
lead to increased or decreased risk of infection spread. We also study the
reasons behind the risk differences associated with different boarding
processes. We accomplish this by simulating the new boarding processes using
pedestrian dynamics and compare them against alternatives. Our results show
that back-to-front boarding roughly doubles the infection exposure compared
with random boarding. It also increases exposure by around 50% compared to a
typical boarding process prior to the outbreak of COVID-19. While keeping
middle seats empty yields a substantial reduction in exposure, our results show
that the different boarding processes have similar relative strengths in this
case as with middle seats occupied. We show that the increased exposure arises
from the proximity between passengers moving in the aisle and while seated. Our
results suggest that airlines either revert to their earlier boarding process

boarding strategy that separates the passengers into several groups and those
groups, which are then called in a certain order. Group boarding can reduce the

insufficient in several real scenarios because the passengers are not separated
strictly into groups. In this paper, we propose a boarding strategy that
arranges the order of the boarding passengers at the boarding gate. Although
this approach appears more time-consuming, we show that such a rearrangement
can be applied efficiently to the waiting queue of a single-aisle aircraft. We

In Latin squares, a subsystem and its most distant mate together have as many

at most $n+1$ non-attacking rooks can be completed exactly if it satisfies the
capacity condition. In a layer of a Latin square, two subsystems of a remote
couple are in balance. Thus, a necessary condition for completion of a layer
can be formulated, the balance condition. For an LSC, each 1-dimensional
subspace of the chess-board contains exactly one rook. Consequently, for the
PLSCs derived from partial Latin squares, we examine certain sets of
1-dimensional subspaces because they indicate the number of missing rooks.",2208.06166v1,math.CO,2022-08-12 08:34:13+00:00,[arxiv.Result.Author('Béla Jónás')],

considered as a chess-board of size $n\times n\times \ldots\times n$ ($d$
times), containing $n^d$ cells with $n^{d-1}$ non-attacking rooks. Each cell is
identified by a $d$-tuple $(e_1,e_2,\ldots ,e_d)$ where $e_i \in \{1,2,\ldots

main class.
  A subsystem $T$ induced by a family of sets $<E_1,E_2,\ldots ,E_d>$ over
$\{1,2,\ldots ,n\}$ is real if $E_i \subset \{1,2,\ldots ,n\}$ for each $i \in
\{1,2,\ldots ,d\}$. The density of $T$ is the ratio of contained rooks to the
number of cells in $T$. The distance between two subsystems is the minimum
Hamming distance between cell pairs. Replacing $k$ sets of $<E_1,E_2,\ldots
,E_d>$ by their complements, a subsystem $U$ is obtained with distance $k$
between $T$ and $U$. All these subsystems, including $T$, form a partition of

760,ICANN and Antitrust,"The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) is a private
non-profit company which, pursuant to contracts with the US government, acts as
the de facto regulator for DNS policy. ICANN decides what TLDs will be made
available to users, and which registrars will be permitted to offer those TLDs
for sale. In this article we focus on a hitherto-neglected implication of
ICANN's assertion that it is a private rather than a public actor: its
potential liability under the U.S. antitrust laws, and the liability of those
who transact with it. ICANN argues that it is not as closely tied to the
government as NSI and IANA were in the days before ICANN was created. If this
is correct, it seems likely that ICANN will not benefit from the antitrust
immunity those actors enjoyed. Some of ICANN's regulatory actions may restrain
competition, e.g. its requirement that applicants for new gTLDs demonstrate
that their proposals would not enable competitive (alternate) roots and ICANN's
preventing certain types of non-price competition among registrars (requiring
the UDRP). ICANN's rule adoption process might be characterized as
anticompetitive collusion by existing registrars, who are likely not be subject
to the Noerr-Pennington lobbying exemption. Whether ICANN has in fact violated
the antitrust laws depends on whether it is an antitrust state actor, whether
the DNS is an essential facility, and on whether it can shelter under
precedents that protect standard-setting bodies. If (as seems likely) a private
ICANN and those who petition it are subject to antitrust law, everyone involved
in the process needs to review their conduct with an eye towards legal
liability. ICANN should act very differently with respect to both the UDRP and
the competitive roots if it is to avoid restraining trade.",cs/0109075v1,cs.CY,2001-09-24 19:25:48+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('A. Michael Froomkin'), arxiv.Result.Author('Mark A. Lemley')]",
761,TRIP: Trustless Coercion-Resistant In-Person Voter Registration,"Most existing remote electronic voting systems are vulnerable to voter

voter registration scheme enabling voters to create verifiable and
indistinguishable real and fake credentials using an untrusted kiosk inside a
privacy booth at a supervised location, e.g., the registrar's office. TRIP
ensures the integrity of the voter's real credential while enabling the
creation of fake credentials using interactive zero-knowledge proofs between
the voter as the verifier and the kiosk as the prover, unbeknownst to the
average voter. TRIP ensures that even voters who are under extreme coercion,
and cannot leave the booth with a real credential, can delegate their vote to a
political party, with the caveat that they must then trust the kiosk. TRIP
optimizes the tallying process by limiting the number of credentials a voter
can receive and capping the number of votes that a credential can cast per
election. We conduct a preliminary usability study among 41 participants at a
university and found that 42.5% of participants rated TRIP a B or higher in

boarding strategy that separates the passengers into several groups and those
groups, which are then called in a certain order. Group boarding can reduce the
boarding time compared with that in random order boarding; however, it is
insufficient in several real scenarios because the passengers are not separated
strictly into groups. In this paper, we propose a boarding strategy that
arranges the order of the boarding passengers at the boarding gate. Although
this approach appears more time-consuming, we show that such a rearrangement
can be applied efficiently to the waiting queue of a single-aisle aircraft. We
quantitatively demonstrate the boarding times for various patterns of this
approach and discuss the mechanism underlying the reduction of boarding time.
This strategy is a promising approach to reduce boarding times and can replace

look at the board as a graph and combine a graph neural network architecture

Our ScalableAlphaZero is capable of learning to play incrementally on small

772,Is Task Board Customization Beneficial? - An Eye Tracking Study,"The task board is an essential artifact in many agile development approaches.
It provides a good overview of the project status. Teams often customize their
task boards according to the team members' needs. They modify the structure of
boards, define colored codings for different purposes, and introduce different
card sizes. Although the customizations are intended to improve the task
board's usability and effectiveness, they may also complicate its comprehension
and use. The increased effort impedes the work of both the team and team
externals. Hence, task board customization is in conflict with the agile
practice of fast and easy overview for everyone. In an eye tracking study with
30 participants, we compared an original task board design with three
customized ones to investigate which design shortened the required time to
identify a particular story card. Our findings yield that only the customized
task board design with modified structures reduces the required time. The
original task board design is more beneficial than individual colored codings
and changed card sizes. According to our findings, agile teams should rethink
their current task board design. They may be better served by focusing on the
original task board design and by applying only carefully selected adjustments.
In case of customization, a task board's structure should be adjusted since
this is the only beneficial kind of customization, that additionally complies

difficult, with approaches primarily focusing on tackling consequences instead
of prevention, as websites are routinely seen as quasi-sovereign organisms.
Websites, however, rely upon a host of service providers, which, in a way, hold
substantial power over them. Notwithstanding the apparent power hold by such
tech stack layers, scholarship on this topic remains largely limited. This
article contributes to this small body of knowledge by providing a
first-of-its-kind systematic mapping of the back-end infrastructural support

approach is based on collecting and analyzing data on top-level domain
operators, domain name Registrars, email providers, web hosting providers, and
utilized website tracking technologies of 150 Czech and Slovak untrustworthy
websites. Our findings show that the Czech and Slovak untrustworthy website
landscape relies on a vast number of back-end services spread across multiple

by locally based companies. Finally, given our findings, we discuss various

775,A Novel Service Oriented Model for Query Identification and Solution Development using Semantic Web and Multi Agent System,"In this paper, we propose to develop service model architecture by merging
multi-agentsystems and semantic web technology. The proposed architecture works
in two stages namely, Query Identification and Solution Development. A person
referred to as customer will submit the problem details or requirements which
will be referred to as a query. Anyone who can provide a service will need to
register with the registrar module of the architecture. Services can be
anything ranging from expert consultancy in the field of agriculture to
academic research, from selling products to manufacturing goods, from medical
help to legal issues or even providing logistics. Query submitted by customer
is first parsed and then iteratively understood with the help of domain experts
and the customer to get a precise set of properties. Query thus identified will
be solved again with the help of intelligent agent systems which will search
the semantic web for all those who can find or provide a solution. A workable
solution workflow is created and then depending on the requirements, using the
techniques of negotiation or auctioning, solution is implemented to complete
the service for customer. This part is termed as solution development. In this
service oriented architecture, we first try to analyze the complex set of user
requirements then try to provide best possible solution in an optimized way by
combining better information searches through semantic web and better workflow

776,"Ethereum Name Service: the Good, the Bad, and the Ugly","DNS has always been criticized for its inherent design flaws, making the
system vulnerable to kinds of attacks. Besides, DNS domain names are not fully
controlled by the users, which can be easily taken down by the authorities and
registrars. Since blockchain has its unique properties like immutability and
decentralization, it seems to be promising to build a decentralized name
service on blockchain. Ethereum Name Service (ENS), as a novel name service
built atop Etheruem, has received great attention from the community. Yet, no
existing work has systematically studied this emerging system, especially the
security issues and misbehaviors in ENS. To fill the void, we present the first
large-scale study of ENS by collecting and analyzing millions of event logs
related to ENS. We characterize the ENS system from a number of perspectives.
Our findings suggest that ENS is showing gradually popularity during its four
years' evolution, mainly due to its distributed and open nature that ENS domain
names can be set to any kinds of records, even censored and malicious contents.
We have identified several security issues and misbehaviors including
traditional DNS security issues and new issues introduced by ENS smart
contracts. Attackers are abusing the system with thousands of squatting ENS

out the general scholarly usage of this top-level domain. In particular, the
following three questions are pursued: usage (number of web domains registered
with the dot-science), purpose (main function and category of websites linked
to these web domains), and impact (websites' visibility and authority). To do
this, 13,900 domain names were gathered through ICANN's Domain Name

the results obtained, it is concluded that the dot-science top-level domain is

Websites receiving the highest number of backlinks were generally related to
non-academic websites applying intensive link building practices and offering

781,3D Meta-Registration: Learning to Learn Registration of 3D Point Clouds,"Deep learning-based point cloud registration models are often generalized
from extensive training over a large volume of data to learn the ability to
predict the desired geometric transformation to register 3D point clouds. In
this paper, we propose a meta-learning based 3D registration model, named 3D
Meta-Registration, that is capable of rapidly adapting and well generalizing to
new 3D registration tasks for unseen 3D point clouds. Our 3D Meta-Registration
gains a competitive advantage by training over a variety of 3D registration
tasks, which leads to an optimized model for the best performance on the
distribution of registration tasks including potentially unseen tasks.
Specifically, the proposed 3D Meta-Registration model consists of two modules:
3D registration learner and 3D registration meta-learner. During the training,
the 3D registration learner is trained to complete a specific registration task
aiming to determine the desired geometric transformation that aligns the source
point cloud with the target one. In the meantime, the 3D registration
meta-learner is trained to provide the optimal parameters to update the 3D
registration learner based on the learned task distribution. After training,
the 3D registration meta-learner, which is learned with the optimized coverage
of distribution of 3D registration tasks, is able to dynamically update 3D
registration learners with desired parameters to rapidly adapt to new
registration tasks. We tested our model on synthesized dataset ModelNet and
FlyingThings3D, as well as real-world dataset KITTI. Experimental results
demonstrate that 3D Meta-Registration achieves superior performance over other
previous techniques (e.g. FlowNet3D).",2010.11504v1,cs.CV,2020-10-22 07:45:09+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Lingjing Wang'), arxiv.Result.Author('Yu Hao'), arxiv.Result.Author('Xiang Li'), arxiv.Result.Author('Yi Fang')]",

783,A Deep Learning Framework for Unsupervised Affine and Deformable Image Registration,"Image registration, the process of aligning two or more images, is the core
technique of many (semi-)automatic medical image analysis tasks. Recent studies
have shown that deep learning methods, notably convolutional neural networks
(ConvNets), can be used for image registration. Thus far training of ConvNets
for registration was supervised using predefined example registrations.
However, obtaining example registrations is not trivial. To circumvent the need
for predefined examples, and thereby to increase convenience of training
ConvNets for image registration, we propose the Deep Learning Image
Registration (DLIR) framework for \textit{unsupervised} affine and deformable
image registration. In the DLIR framework ConvNets are trained for image
registration by exploiting image similarity analogous to conventional
intensity-based image registration. After a ConvNet has been trained with the
DLIR framework, it can be used to register pairs of unseen images in one shot.
We propose flexible ConvNets designs for affine image registration and for
deformable image registration. By stacking multiple of these ConvNets into a
larger architecture, we are able to perform coarse-to-fine image registration.
We show for registration of cardiac cine MRI and registration of chest CT that
performance of the DLIR framework is comparable to conventional image
registration while being several orders of magnitude faster.",1809.06130v2,cs.CV,2018-09-17 11:14:54+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Bob D. de Vos'), arxiv.Result.Author('Floris F.

  Method: 18 participants in various stages of clinical training across two

HoloLens 2 augmented reality headset 3 consecutive times. Registration times
and accuracy were compared among different registration methods (hand gesture,
Xbox controller, and automatic registration), levels of clinical experience,
and consecutive attempts. Registration times were also compared with prior
HoloLens 1 data.
  Results: Mean aggregate manual registration times were 27.7, 24.3, and 72.8
seconds for one-handed gesture, two-handed gesture, and Xbox controller,
respectively; mean automatic registration time was 5.3s (ANOVA p<0.0001). No
significant difference in registration times was found among attendings,

in registration times were detected across consecutive attempts using hand
gestures (p<0.01). Compared with previously reported HoloLens 1 experience,
hand gesture registration times were 81.7% faster (p<0.05). Registration
accuracies were not significantly different across manual registration methods,

789,Joint segmentation and discontinuity-preserving deformable registration: Application to cardiac cine-MR images,"Medical image registration is a challenging task involving the estimation of
spatial transformations to establish anatomical correspondence between pairs or
groups of images. Recently, deep learning-based image registration methods have
been widely explored, and demonstrated to enable fast and accurate image
registration in a variety of applications. However, most deep learning-based
registration methods assume that the deformation fields are smooth and
continuous everywhere in the image domain, which is not always true, especially
when registering images whose fields of view contain discontinuities at
tissue/organ boundaries. In such scenarios, enforcing smooth, globally
continuous deformation fields leads to incorrect/implausible registration
results. We propose a novel discontinuity-preserving image registration method
to tackle this challenge, which ensures globally discontinuous and locally
smooth deformation fields, leading to more accurate and realistic registration
results. The proposed method leverages the complementary nature of image
segmentation and registration and enables joint segmentation and pair-wise
registration of images. A co-attention block is proposed in the segmentation
component of the network to learn the structural correlations in the input
images, while a discontinuity-preserving registration strategy is employed in
the registration component of the network to ensure plausibility in the
estimated deformation fields at tissue/organ interfaces. We evaluate our method

791,Towards Positive Jacobian: Learn to Postprocess Diffeomorphic Image Registration with Matrix Exponential,"We present a postprocessing layer for deformable image registration to make a
registration field more diffeomorphic by encouraging Jacobians of the
transformation to be positive. Diffeomorphic image registration is important
for medical imaging studies because of the properties like invertibility,
smoothness of the transformation, and topology preservation/non-folding of the
grid. Violation of these properties can lead to destruction of the
neighbourhood and the connectivity of anatomical structures during image
registration. Most of the recent deep learning methods do not explicitly
address this folding problem and try to solve it with a smoothness
regularization on the registration field. In this paper, we propose a
differentiable layer, which takes any registration field as its input, computes
exponential of the Jacobian matrices of the input and reconstructs a new
registration field from the exponentiated Jacobian matrices using Poisson
reconstruction. Our proposed Poisson reconstruction loss enforces positive
Jacobians for the final registration field. Thus, our method acts as a
post-processing layer without any learnable parameters of its own and can be
placed at the end of any deep learning pipeline to form an end-to-end learnable
framework. We show the effectiveness of our proposed method for a popular deep
learning registration method Voxelmorph and evaluate it with a dataset
containing 3D brain MRI scans. Our results show that our post-processing can
effectively decrease the number of non-positive Jacobians by a significant
amount without any noticeable deterioration of the registration accuracy, thus
making the registration field more diffeomorphic. Our code is available online

the estimated error is high. However, error estimates are difficult to acquire.
Probabilistic image registration (PIR) methods provide measures of registration
uncertainty, which could be a surrogate for assessing the registration error.
It is intuitive and believed by many clinicians that high uncertainty indicates
a large error. However, the monotonic association between uncertainty and error
has not been examined in image registration literature. In this pilot study, we
attempt to address this fundamental problem by looking at one PIR method, the
Gaussian process (GP) registration. We systematically investigate the relation
between GP uncertainty and error based on clinical data and show empirically
that there is a weak-to-moderate positive monotonic correlation between
point-wise GP registration uncertainty and non-rigid registration error.",1908.07709v2,cs.CV,2019-08-21 04:57:25+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Jie Luo'), arxiv.Result.Author('Sarah Frisken'), arxiv.Result.Author('Duo Wang'), arxiv.Result.Author('Alexandra Golby'), arxiv.Result.Author('Masashi Sugiyama'), arxiv.Result.Author('William M.

796,Arranging the order of passengers on the boarding bridge to reduce the boarding time for single-aisle aircraft,"Reducing the aircraft boarding time is a common problem not only for
airlines, but also for passengers and airports. Group boarding is a popular
boarding strategy that separates the passengers into several groups and those
groups, which are then called in a certain order. Group boarding can reduce the
boarding time compared with that in random order boarding; however, it is
insufficient in several real scenarios because the passengers are not separated
strictly into groups. In this paper, we propose a boarding strategy that
arranges the order of the boarding passengers at the boarding gate. Although
this approach appears more time-consuming, we show that such a rearrangement
can be applied efficiently to the waiting queue of a single-aisle aircraft. We
quantitatively demonstrate the boarding times for various patterns of this
approach and discuss the mechanism underlying the reduction of boarding time.
This strategy is a promising approach to reduce boarding times and can replace
the conventional boarding strategy.",2109.13431v1,physics.soc-ph,2021-09-28 02:01:00+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Sakurako Tanida'), arxiv.Result.Author('Katsuhiro Nishinari')]",

800,Boardroom Voting: Verifiable Voting with Ballot Privacy Using Low-Tech Cryptography in a Single Room,"A boardroom election is an election that takes place in a single room -- the
boardroom -- in which all voters can see and hear each other. We present an
initial exploration of boardroom elections with ballot privacy and voter
verifiability that use only ""low-tech cryptography"" without using computers to
mark or collect ballots. Specifically, we define the problem, introduce several
building blocks, and propose a new protocol that combines these blocks in novel
ways. Our new building blocks include ""foldable ballots"" that can be rotated to
hide the alignment of ballot choices with voting marks, and ""visual secrets""
that are easy to remember and use but hard to describe. Although closely seated
participants in a boardroom election have limited privacy, the protocol ensures
that no one can determine how others voted. Moreover, each voter can verify
that their ballot was correctly cast, collected, and counted, without being
able to prove how they voted, providing assurance against undue influence.
Low-tech cryptography is useful in situations where constituents do not trust
computer technology, and it avoids the complex auditing requirements of
end-to-end cryptographic voting systems such as Pr\^{e}t-\`{a}-Voter. This
paper's building blocks and protocol are meant to be a proof of concept that
might be tested for usability and improved.",2007.14916v2,cs.CR,2020-07-29 15:40:51+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Enka Blanchard'), arxiv.Result.Author('Ted Selker'), arxiv.Result.Author('Alan T. Sherman')]",
801,BVOT: Self-Tallying Boardroom Voting with Oblivious Transfer,"A boardroom election is an election with a small number of voters carried out
with public communications. We present BVOT, a self-tallying boardroom voting
protocol with ballot secrecy, fairness (no tally information is available
before the polls close), and dispute-freeness (voters can observe that all
voters correctly followed the protocol).
  BVOT works by using a multiparty threshold homomorphic encryption system in
which each candidate is associated with a masked unique prime. Each voter
engages in an oblivious transfer with an untrusted distributor: the voter
selects the index of a prime associated with a candidate and receives the
selected prime in masked form. The voter then casts their vote by encrypting
their masked prime and broadcasting it to everyone. The distributor does not
learn the voter's choice, and no one learns the mapping between primes and
candidates until the audit phase. By hiding the mapping between primes and
candidates, BVOT provides voters with insufficient information to carry out
effective cheating. The threshold feature prevents anyone from computing any
partial tally---until everyone has voted. Multiplying all votes, their
decryption shares, and the unmasking factor yields a product of the primes each
raised to the number of votes received.
  In contrast to some existing boardroom voting protocols, BVOT does not rely
on any zero-knowledge proof; instead, it uses oblivious transfer to assure
ballot secrecy and correct vote casting. Also, BVOT can handle multiple
candidates in one election. BVOT prevents cheating by hiding crucial
information: an attempt to increase the tally of one candidate might increase
the tally of another candidate. After all votes are cast, any party can tally
the votes.",2010.02421v1,cs.CR,2020-10-06 01:28:34+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Farid Javani'), arxiv.Result.Author('Alan T. Sherman')]",
802,SBvote: Scalable Self-Tallying Blockchain-Based Voting,"Decentralized electronic voting solutions represent a promising advancement

practical instantiation of the immutable bulletin board that this scheme
requires to preserve its properties. Existing smart contract-based approaches
employing the self-tallying scheme (such as OVN or BBB-Voting) are only

The goal of our work is to build on existing solutions to achieve scalability
without losing privacy guarantees and verifiability. We present SBvote, a
blockchain-based self-tallying voting protocol that is scalable in the number
of voters and therefore suitable for large-scale elections. The evaluation of
our proof-of-concept implementation shows that the protocol's scalability is

consequences for the polling results which can be used to identify election
irregularities. Using a suitable data collapse, we find that vote distributions
of elections with alleged fraud show a kurtosis of hundred times more than
normal elections on certain levels of data aggregation. As an example we show
that reported irregularities in recent Russian elections are indeed well
explained by systematic ballot stuffing and develop a parametric model
quantifying to which extent fraudulent mechanisms are present. We show that if
specific statistical properties are present in an election, the results do not
represent the will of the people. We formulate a parametric test detecting
these statistical properties in election results. Remarkably, this technique

804,Phrase-Verified Voting: Verifiable Low-Tech Remote Boardroom Voting,"We present Phrase-Verified Voting, a voter-verifiable remote voting system
assembled from commercial off-the-shelf software for small private elections.
The system is transparent and enables each voter to verify that the tally
includes their ballot selection without requiring any understanding of
cryptography. This paper describes the system and its use in fall 2020, to vote
remotely in promotion committees in a university. Each voter fills out a form
in the cloud with their vote V (YES, NO, ABSTAIN) and a passphrase P-two words
entered by the voter. The system generates a verification prompt of the (P,V)
pairs and a tally of the votes, organized to help visualize how the votes add
up. After the polls close, each voter verifies that this table lists their
(P,V) pair and that the tally is computed correctly. The system is especially
appropriate for any small group making sensitive decisions. Because the system
would not prevent a coercer from demanding that their victim use a specified
passphrase, it is not designed for applications where such malfeasance would be
likely or go undetected. Results from 43 voters show that the system was
well-accepted, performed effectively for its intended purpose, and introduced
users to the concept of voter-verified elections. Compared to the commonly-used
alternatives of paper ballots or voting by email, voters found the system
easier to use, and that it provided greater privacy and outcome integrity.",2103.07180v1,cs.CR,2021-03-12 09:59:55+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Enka Blanchard'), arxiv.Result.Author('Ryan Robucci'), arxiv.Result.Author('Ted Selker'), arxiv.Result.Author('Alan Sherman')]",

the outcome of the election the same, regardless of the changes to the votes.
It is well known that the US electoral college system is about 5 times more
likely to have a changed outcome due to vote corruption, when compared to a
majority vote. In fact, Mossel, O'Donnell and Oleszkiewicz proved in 2005 that
the majority voting method is most stable to this random vote corruption, among
voting methods where each person has a small influence on the election. We
discuss some recent progress on the analogous result for elections between more
than two candidates. In this case, plurality should be most stable to
corruption in votes. We also survey results on adversarial election

in a non-random way), and we briefly discuss ranked choice voting methods

807,The Complexity of Online Manipulation of Sequential Elections,"Most work on manipulation assumes that all preferences are known to the
manipulators. However, in many settings elections are open and sequential, and
manipulators may know the already cast votes but may not know the future votes.
We introduce a framework, in which manipulators can see the past votes but not
the future ones, to model online coalitional manipulation of sequential
elections, and we show that in this setting manipulation can be extremely
complex even for election systems with simple winner problems. Yet we also show
that for some of the most important election systems such manipulation is
simple in certain settings. This suggests that when using sequential voting,
one should pay great attention to the details of the setting in choosing one's
voting rule.
  Among the highlights of our classifications are: We show that, depending on
the size of the manipulative coalition, the online manipulation problem can be
complete for each level of the polynomial hierarchy or even for PSPACE. We
obtain the most dramatic contrast to date between the nonunique-winner and
unique-winner models: Online weighted manipulation for plurality is in P in the
nonunique-winner model, yet is coNP-hard (constructive case) and NP-hard
(destructive case) in the unique-winner model. And we obtain what to the best

assign a set of winners to each profile of voter preferences. A voting method
satisfies the property of positive involvement (PI) if for any election in
which a candidate x would be among the winners, adding another voter to the
election who ranks x first does not cause x to lose. Surprisingly, a number of
standard voting methods violate this natural property. In this paper, we
investigate different ways of measuring the extent to which a voting method
violates PI, using computer simulations. We consider the probability (under
different probability models for preferences) of PI violations in randomly
drawn profiles vs. profile-coalition pairs (involving coalitions of different
sizes). We argue that in order to choose between a voting method that satisfies
PI and one that does not, we should consider the probability of PI violation
conditional on the voting methods choosing different winners. We should also
relativize the probability of PI violation to what we call voter potency, the
probability that a voter causes a candidate to lose. Although absolute
frequencies of PI violations may be low, after this conditioning and
relativization, we see that under certain voting methods that violate PI, much
of a voter's potency is turned against them - in particular, against their
desire to see their favorite candidate elected.",2106.11502v1,cs.GT,2021-06-22 02:46:37+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Wesley H. Holliday'), arxiv.Result.Author('Eric Pacuit')]","EPTCS 335, 2021, pp. 189-209"

have been shown to produce committees that are proportional, in the sense that
they proportionally represent voters' preferences; all of these rules are
strategically manipulable by voters. On the other hand, a generalisation of
Approval Voting gives a non-proportional but strategyproof voting rule. We show
that there is a fundamental tradeoff between these two properties: we prove
that no multiwinner voting rule can simultaneously satisfy a weak form of
proportionality (a weakening of justified representation) and a weak form of
strategyproofness. Our impossibility is obtained using a formulation of the
problem in propositional logic and applying SAT solvers; a human-readable

Surprisingly this had gone undetected, even as the field was score-carding how
many std. control types election systems were resistant to; various ""different""

that no identical control pairs exist beyond the known 7. We for 3 central
election systems determine which control pairs are identical (""collapse"") with
respect to those systems, and we explore containment/incomparability
relationships between control pairs. For approval voting, which has a different

decrypt each vote. Ballot sheets are encrypted by onion-routing, which has a
layer with the key of the election instance, so it's impossible for a quorum to
decode the results before they have announced their decision by exposing their
keys. A register of voters ensures that only verified voters can vote without
compromising their identity. If there any doubts about the identity of a voter,
their vote can be excluded from the election, if a quorum agrees. This system
is designed to scale from one instance to a distributed system that runs over
an unlimited number of instances, which can be achieved using cloud instances
or smartphones belonging to voters or tellers.",2011.10902v2,cs.CR,2020-11-22 00:58:34+00:00,[arxiv.Result.Author('Kirill A. Korinsky')],
819,Control Complexity in Bucklin and Fallback Voting,"Electoral control models ways of changing the outcome of an election via such
actions as adding/deleting/partitioning either candidates or voters. To protect
elections from such control attempts, computational complexity has been
investigated and the corresponding NP-hardness results are termed ""resistance.""
It has been a long-running project of research in this area to classify the
major voting systems in terms of their resistance properties. We show that
fallback voting, an election system proposed by Brams and Sanver (2009) to
combine Bucklin with approval voting, is resistant to each of the common types
of control except to destructive control by either adding or deleting voters.
Thus fallback voting displays the broadest control resistance currently known
to hold among natural election systems with a polynomial-time winner problem.
We also study the control complexity of Bucklin voting and show that it
performs at least almost as well as fallback voting in terms of control
resistance. As Bucklin voting is a special case of fallback voting, each
resistance shown for Bucklin voting strengthens the corresponding resistance
for fallback voting. Such worst-case complexity analysis is at best an
indication of security against control attempts, rather than a proof. In
practice, the difficulty of control will depend on the structure of typical
instances. We investigate the parameterized control complexity of Bucklin and
fallback voting, according to several parameters that are often likely to be
small for typical instances. Our results, though still in the worst-case
complexity model, can be interpreted as significant strengthenings of the
resistance demonstrations based on NP-hardness.",1103.2230v2,cs.CC,2011-03-11 10:17:49+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Gábor Erdélyi'), arxiv.Result.Author('Michael Fellows'), arxiv.Result.Author('Jörg Rothe'), arxiv.Result.Author('Lena Schend')]",
820,Boardroom Voting: Verifiable Voting with Ballot Privacy Using Low-Tech Cryptography in a Single Room,"A boardroom election is an election that takes place in a single room -- the
boardroom -- in which all voters can see and hear each other. We present an
initial exploration of boardroom elections with ballot privacy and voter
verifiability that use only ""low-tech cryptography"" without using computers to
mark or collect ballots. Specifically, we define the problem, introduce several
building blocks, and propose a new protocol that combines these blocks in novel
ways. Our new building blocks include ""foldable ballots"" that can be rotated to
hide the alignment of ballot choices with voting marks, and ""visual secrets""
that are easy to remember and use but hard to describe. Although closely seated
participants in a boardroom election have limited privacy, the protocol ensures
that no one can determine how others voted. Moreover, each voter can verify
that their ballot was correctly cast, collected, and counted, without being
able to prove how they voted, providing assurance against undue influence.
Low-tech cryptography is useful in situations where constituents do not trust
computer technology, and it avoids the complex auditing requirements of
end-to-end cryptographic voting systems such as Pr\^{e}t-\`{a}-Voter. This
paper's building blocks and protocol are meant to be a proof of concept that
might be tested for usability and improved.",2007.14916v2,cs.CR,2020-07-29 15:40:51+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Enka Blanchard'), arxiv.Result.Author('Ted Selker'), arxiv.Result.Author('Alan T. Sherman')]",
821,BVOT: Self-Tallying Boardroom Voting with Oblivious Transfer,"A boardroom election is an election with a small number of voters carried out
with public communications. We present BVOT, a self-tallying boardroom voting
protocol with ballot secrecy, fairness (no tally information is available
before the polls close), and dispute-freeness (voters can observe that all
voters correctly followed the protocol).
  BVOT works by using a multiparty threshold homomorphic encryption system in
which each candidate is associated with a masked unique prime. Each voter
engages in an oblivious transfer with an untrusted distributor: the voter
selects the index of a prime associated with a candidate and receives the
selected prime in masked form. The voter then casts their vote by encrypting
their masked prime and broadcasting it to everyone. The distributor does not
learn the voter's choice, and no one learns the mapping between primes and
candidates until the audit phase. By hiding the mapping between primes and
candidates, BVOT provides voters with insufficient information to carry out
effective cheating. The threshold feature prevents anyone from computing any
partial tally---until everyone has voted. Multiplying all votes, their
decryption shares, and the unmasking factor yields a product of the primes each
raised to the number of votes received.
  In contrast to some existing boardroom voting protocols, BVOT does not rely
on any zero-knowledge proof; instead, it uses oblivious transfer to assure
ballot secrecy and correct vote casting. Also, BVOT can handle multiple
candidates in one election. BVOT prevents cheating by hiding crucial
information: an attempt to increase the tally of one candidate might increase
the tally of another candidate. After all votes are cast, any party can tally
the votes.",2010.02421v1,cs.CR,2020-10-06 01:28:34+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Farid Javani'), arxiv.Result.Author('Alan T. Sherman')]",
822,BBB-Voting: 1-out-of-k Blockchain-Based Boardroom Voting,"Voting is a means to agree on a collective decision based on available
choices (e.g., candidates), where participants (voters) agree to abide by their
outcome. To improve some features of e-voting, decentralized solutions based on
a blockchain can be employed, where the blockchain represents a public bulletin
board that in contrast to a centralized bulletin board provides $100\%$
availability and censorship resistance. A blockchain ensures that all entities
in the voting system have the same view of the actions made by others due to
its immutable and append-only log. The existing blockchain-based boardroom
voting solution called Open Voting Network (OVN) provides the privacy of votes
and perfect ballot secrecy, but it supports only two candidates. We present
BBB-Voting, an equivalent blockchain-based approach for decentralized voting
than OVN, but in contrast to it, BBB-Voting supports 1-out-of-$k$ choices and
provides a fault tolerance mechanism that enables recovery from stalling
participants. We provide a cost-optimized implementation using Ethereum, which
we compare with OVN and show that our work decreases the costs for voters by
$13.5\%$ in terms of gas consumption. Next, we outline the extension of our
implementation scaling to magnitudes higher number of participants than in a

824,SBvote: Scalable Self-Tallying Blockchain-Based Voting,"Decentralized electronic voting solutions represent a promising advancement
in electronic voting. One of the e-voting paradigms, the self-tallying scheme,
offers strong protection of the voters' privacy while making the whole voting

practical instantiation of the immutable bulletin board that this scheme
requires to preserve its properties. Existing smart contract-based approaches
employing the self-tallying scheme (such as OVN or BBB-Voting) are only
suitable for a boardroom voting scenario due to their scalability limitation.
The goal of our work is to build on existing solutions to achieve scalability
without losing privacy guarantees and verifiability. We present SBvote, a
blockchain-based self-tallying voting protocol that is scalable in the number
of voters and therefore suitable for large-scale elections. The evaluation of
our proof-of-concept implementation shows that the protocol's scalability is

825,Phrase-Verified Voting: Verifiable Low-Tech Remote Boardroom Voting,"We present Phrase-Verified Voting, a voter-verifiable remote voting system
assembled from commercial off-the-shelf software for small private elections.
The system is transparent and enables each voter to verify that the tally
includes their ballot selection without requiring any understanding of
cryptography. This paper describes the system and its use in fall 2020, to vote
remotely in promotion committees in a university. Each voter fills out a form
in the cloud with their vote V (YES, NO, ABSTAIN) and a passphrase P-two words
entered by the voter. The system generates a verification prompt of the (P,V)
pairs and a tally of the votes, organized to help visualize how the votes add
up. After the polls close, each voter verifies that this table lists their
(P,V) pair and that the tally is computed correctly. The system is especially
appropriate for any small group making sensitive decisions. Because the system
would not prevent a coercer from demanding that their victim use a specified
passphrase, it is not designed for applications where such malfeasance would be
likely or go undetected. Results from 43 voters show that the system was
well-accepted, performed effectively for its intended purpose, and introduced
users to the concept of voter-verified elections. Compared to the commonly-used
alternatives of paper ballots or voting by email, voters found the system
easier to use, and that it provided greater privacy and outcome integrity.",2103.07180v1,cs.CR,2021-03-12 09:59:55+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Enka Blanchard'), arxiv.Result.Author('Ryan Robucci'), arxiv.Result.Author('Ted Selker'), arxiv.Result.Author('Alan Sherman')]",
826,Dispute-free Scalable Open Vote Network using zk-SNARKs,"The Open Vote Network is a self-tallying decentralized e-voting protocol
suitable for boardroom elections. Currently, it has two Ethereum-based
implementations: the first, by McCorry et al., has a scalability issue since
all the computations are performed on-chain. The second implementation, by
Seifelnasr et al., solves this issue partially by assigning a part of the heavy
computations to an off-chain untrusted administrator in a verifiable manner. As
a side effect, this second implementation became not dispute-free; there is a
need for a tally dispute phase where an observer interrupts the protocol when
the administrator cheats, i.e., announces a wrong tally result. In this work,
we propose a new smart contract design to tackle the problems in the previous
implementations by (i) preforming all the heavy computations off-chain hence
achieving higher scalability, and (ii) utilizing zero-knowledge Succinct
Non-interactive Argument of Knowledge (zk-SNARK) to verify the correctness of
the off-chain computations, hence maintaining the dispute-free property. To
demonstrate the effectiveness of our design, we develop prototype
implementations on Ethereum and conduct multiple experiments for different
implementation options that show a trade-off between the zk-SNARK proof
generation time and the smart contract gas cost, including an implementation in
which the smart contract consumes a constant amount of gas independent of the
number of voters.",2203.03363v1,cs.CR,2022-03-07 13:12:28+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Muhammad ElSheikh'), arxiv.Result.Author('Amr M. Youssef')]",

pipeline that includes several standard transformations (eta-expansion,
inlining, etc) implemented in a proof-generating manner along with a verified
optimisation pass removing unused arguments. We prove the pass correct wrt. a

contribute with two verified real-world smart contracts (boardroom voting and
escrow), which we use, among other examples, to exemplify the applicability of
the pipeline. In addition, we develop a verified web application and extract it

companies in Germany and in the United Kingdom, combining ownership links,
social ties through joint board directors, R\&D collaborations and stock
correlations in one linked multiplex dataset. We describe the features of this
network and show there exists a non-trivial overlap between these different
types of networks, where the different types of connections complement each
other and make the overall structure more complex. This highlights that
corporate control, boardroom influence and other connections have different

829,Coupling Asymmetry Optimizes Collective Dynamics over Multiplex Networks,"Complex systems are often interconnected with one system wielding greater
influence over another. However, it is not well understood how such coupling
asymmetry affects self-organized phenomena (e.g., consensus and
synchronization) and the many related applications. Thus motivated, we study
collective dynamics using a generalization of the graph Laplacian for multiplex
networks that contain network layers, which are asymmetrically coupled via a
tunable parameter $\delta\in[-1,1]$. We identify and characterize the nonlinear
and unintuitive effects of coupling asymmetry ($\delta\not=0$) on the
convergence rate toward a collective state, finding that it gives rise to one
or more optima $\hat{\delta}$ that maximally accelerate convergence. When a
faster and a slower system are coupled, depending on their relative timescales,
we show that their optimal coupling is either cooperative (whereby
$|\hat{\delta}|< 1$ and network layers mutually depend on one another) or
non-cooperative (whereby $|\hat{\delta}|= 1$ and one network directs another
without feedback). As an application, we model consensus-based decision making
in a social network (an executive boardroom) that is supported by a network of
AI agents, revealing that the timescales for human and AI communications must
be sufficiently similar to ensure the existence of a cooperative optimum. Our
work highlights optimization through asymmetry as an important direction for
the collective dynamics of human-AI systems and interconnected networks more

830,Measuring Violations of Positive Involvement in Voting,"In the context of computational social choice, we study voting methods that
assign a set of winners to each profile of voter preferences. A voting method
satisfies the property of positive involvement (PI) if for any election in
which a candidate x would be among the winners, adding another voter to the
election who ranks x first does not cause x to lose. Surprisingly, a number of
standard voting methods violate this natural property. In this paper, we
investigate different ways of measuring the extent to which a voting method
violates PI, using computer simulations. We consider the probability (under
different probability models for preferences) of PI violations in randomly
drawn profiles vs. profile-coalition pairs (involving coalitions of different
sizes). We argue that in order to choose between a voting method that satisfies
PI and one that does not, we should consider the probability of PI violation
conditional on the voting methods choosing different winners. We should also
relativize the probability of PI violation to what we call voter potency, the
probability that a voter causes a candidate to lose. Although absolute
frequencies of PI violations may be low, after this conditioning and
relativization, we see that under certain voting methods that violate PI, much
of a voter's potency is turned against them - in particular, against their
desire to see their favorite candidate elected.",2106.11502v1,cs.GT,2021-06-22 02:46:37+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Wesley H. Holliday'), arxiv.Result.Author('Eric Pacuit')]","EPTCS 335, 2021, pp. 189-209"

any specific cryptographic concept; so it can be adapted to future
cryptographic exigencies. Compared with other online voting technologies, we

from dishonest authorities, given that no sensitive information is stored in
any public server and there is no need for any trustee to safeguard the

voting rules such as Proportional Approval Voting (PAV) and Phragm\'en's rules
have been shown to produce committees that are proportional, in the sense that
they proportionally represent voters' preferences; all of these rules are
strategically manipulable by voters. On the other hand, a generalisation of
Approval Voting gives a non-proportional but strategyproof voting rule. We show
that there is a fundamental tradeoff between these two properties: we prove
that no multiwinner voting rule can simultaneously satisfy a weak form of
proportionality (a weakening of justified representation) and a weak form of
strategyproofness. Our impossibility is obtained using a formulation of the
problem in propositional logic and applying SAT solvers; a human-readable

unsatisfiable set (MUS). We also discuss several related axiomatic questions in

racehorses are mixed on the win bet fraction axis. We see the emergence of a
scale invariant relation between the cumulative distribution function of the
winning horse $x_{1}$ and that of the losing horse $x_{0}$. $x_{1}\propto
x_{0}^{\alpha}$ holds in the small win bet fraction region. We also see the
efficiency of the market as the vote proceeds. However, the convergence to the
efficient state is not monotonic. The time change of the distribution of a vote
is complicated. Votes resume concentration on popular horses, after the
distribution spreads to a certain extent. In order to explain scale invariance,
we introduce a simple voting model. In a `double' scaling limit, we show that
the exact scale invariance relation $x_{1}=x_{0}^{\alpha}$ holds over the

There are many existing protocols for voting using smart contracts. We observe
that these either are not scalable or leak the vote tally during the voting

the outcome of the election the same, regardless of the changes to the votes.
It is well known that the US electoral college system is about 5 times more
likely to have a changed outcome due to vote corruption, when compared to a
majority vote. In fact, Mossel, O'Donnell and Oleszkiewicz proved in 2005 that
the majority voting method is most stable to this random vote corruption, among
voting methods where each person has a small influence on the election. We
discuss some recent progress on the analogous result for elections between more
than two candidates. In this case, plurality should be most stable to
corruption in votes. We also survey results on adversarial election

in a non-random way), and we briefly discuss ranked choice voting methods

836,The Complexity of Online Manipulation of Sequential Elections,"Most work on manipulation assumes that all preferences are known to the
manipulators. However, in many settings elections are open and sequential, and
manipulators may know the already cast votes but may not know the future votes.
We introduce a framework, in which manipulators can see the past votes but not
the future ones, to model online coalitional manipulation of sequential
elections, and we show that in this setting manipulation can be extremely
complex even for election systems with simple winner problems. Yet we also show
that for some of the most important election systems such manipulation is
simple in certain settings. This suggests that when using sequential voting,
one should pay great attention to the details of the setting in choosing one's
voting rule.
  Among the highlights of our classifications are: We show that, depending on
the size of the manipulative coalition, the online manipulation problem can be
complete for each level of the polynomial hierarchy or even for PSPACE. We
obtain the most dramatic contrast to date between the nonunique-winner and
unique-winner models: Online weighted manipulation for plurality is in P in the
nonunique-winner model, yet is coNP-hard (constructive case) and NP-hard
(destructive case) in the unique-winner model. And we obtain what to the best
of our knowledge are the first PNP[1]-completeness and PNP-completeness results

completeness for, respectively, the complexity of 3-candidate and 4-candidate

$\Delta_k$ between the $k$-th item and the $(k+1)$-th item. Specifically, we
show that if $\Delta_k$ is greater than certain value, then the top-$k$ items
selected by the algorithm is asymptotically accurate almost surely; if
$\Delta_k$ is below certain value, then the result will be inaccurate with a
constant probability. In the special case of $m=2$, i.e., pairwise comparison,
the resultant bound is tighter than that given by Shah et al., leading to a
reduced gap between the error probability upper and lower bounds. These results
are further extended to the approximate top-$k$ selection setting. Numerical
experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and accuracy of the Borda counting
algorithm, compared with the spectral MLE-based algorithm, particularly when
the data does not necessarily follow an assumed parametric model.",2204.05742v1,cs.DS,2022-04-11 16:31:37+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Wenjing Chen'), arxiv.Result.Author('Ruida Zhou'), arxiv.Result.Author('Chao Tian'), arxiv.Result.Author('Cong Shen')]",
841,Efficient and Accurate Top-$K$ Recovery from Choice Data,"The intersection of learning to rank and choice modeling is an active area of
research with applications in e-commerce, information retrieval and the social
sciences. In some applications such as recommendation systems, the statistician
is primarily interested in recovering the set of the top ranked items from a
large pool of items as efficiently as possible using passively collected
discrete choice data, i.e., the user picks one item from a set of multiple
items. Motivated by this practical consideration, we propose the choice-based
Borda count algorithm as a fast and accurate ranking algorithm for top
$K$-recovery i.e., correctly identifying all of the top $K$ items. We show that
the choice-based Borda count algorithm has optimal sample complexity for
top-$K$ recovery under a broad class of random utility models. We prove that in
the limit, the choice-based Borda count algorithm produces the same top-$K$
estimate as the commonly used Maximum Likelihood Estimate method but the
former's speed and simplicity brings considerable advantages in practice.
Experiments on both synthetic and real datasets show that the counting
algorithm is competitive with commonly used ranking algorithms in terms of
accuracy while being several orders of magnitude faster.",2206.11995v1,cs.LG,2022-06-23 22:05:08+00:00,[arxiv.Result.Author('Duc Nguyen')],
842,Noise Stability of Ranked Choice Voting,"We conjecture that Borda count is the ranked choice voting method that best
preserves the outcome of an election with randomly corrupted votes, among all
fair voting methods with small influences satisfying the Condorcet Loser
Criterion. This conjecture is an adaptation of the Plurality is Stablest
Conjecture to the setting of ranked choice voting. Since the plurality function
does not satisfy the Condorcet Loser Criterion, our new conjecture is not
directly related to the Plurality is Stablest Conjecture. Nevertheless, we show
that the Plurality is Stablest Conjecture implies our new Borda count is
Stablest conjecture. We therefore deduce that Borda count is stablest for
elections with three candidates when the corrupted votes are nearly
uncorrelated with the original votes. We also adapt a dimension reduction
argument to this setting, showing that the optimal ranked choice voting method
is ""low-dimensional.""
  The Condorcet Loser Criterion asserts that a candidate must lose an election
if each other candidate is preferred in head-to-head comparisons. Lastly, we
discuss a variant of our conjecture with the Condorcet Winner Criterion as a
constraint instead of the Condorcet Loser Criterion. In this case, we have no

843,Globally Homogenous Mixture Components and Local Heterogeneity of Rank Data,"The traditional methods of finding mixture components of rank data are mostly
based on distance and latent class models; these models may exhibit the
phenomenon of masking of groups of small sizes; probably due to the spherical
nature of rank data. Our approach diverges from the traditional methods; it is
directional and uses a logical principle, the law of contradiction. We discuss
the concept of a mixture for rank data essentially in terms of the notion of
global homogeneity of its group components. Local heterogeneities may appear
once the group components of the mixture have been discovered. This is done via
the exploratory analysis of rank data by taxicab correspondence analysis with
the nega coding: If the first factor is an affine function of the Borda count,
then we say that the rank data are globally homogenous, and local
heterogeneities may appear on the consequent factors; otherwise, the rank data
either are globally homogenous with outliers, or a mixture of globally
homogenous groups. Also we introduce a new coefficient of global homogeneity,
GHC. GHC is based on the first taxicab dispersion measure: it takes values
between 0 and 100\%, so it is easily interpretable. GHC measures the extent of
crossing of scores of voters between two or three blocks seriation of the items
where the Borda count statistic provides consensus ordering of the items on the
first axis. Examples are provided. Key words: Preferences; rankings; Borda
count; global homogeneity coefficient; nega coding; law of contradiction;

on the tournament graph (like Copeland) respectively. We argue that with an
elimination style voting rule like single transferable vote, partial voting
does not change the situations where strategic voting is possible. However,
with scoring rules and rules based on the tournament graph, partial voting can
increase the situations where strategic voting is possible. As a consequence,
the computational complexity of computing a strategic vote can change. For
example, with Borda count, the complexity of computing a strategic vote can
decrease or stay the same depending on how we score partial votes.",1405.7714v1,cs.GT,2014-05-28 12:13:52+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Nina Narodytska'), arxiv.Result.Author('Toby Walsh')]",

Special cases of $(j,k)$-Kemeny include approval voting, the mean rule and

the winner problem computationally tractable for each of these other rules, but

the $(j,k)$-Kemeny rule first appears at the $j=3$, $k=3$ level. The proof
rests on a reduction of max cut to a related problem on weighted tournaments,
and reveals that computational complexity arises from the cyclic part in the

852,Convergence Voting: From Pairwise Comparisons to Consensus,"An important aspect of AI design and ethics is to create systems that reflect
aggregate preferences of the society. To this end, the techniques of social
choice theory are often utilized. We propose a new social choice function
motivated by the PageRank algorithm. The function ranks voting options based on
the Condorcet graph of pairwise comparisons. To this end, we transform the
Condorcet graph into a Markov chain whose stationary distribution provides the
scores of the options. We show how the values in the stationary distribution
can be interpreted as quantified aggregate support for the voting options, to
which the community of voters converges through an imaginary sequence of
negotiating steps. Because of that, we suggest the name ""convergence voting""
for the new voting scheme, and ""negotiated community support"" for the resulting
stationary allocation of scores.
  Our social choice function can be viewed as a consensus voting method,
sitting somewhere between Copeland and Borda. On the one hand, it does not
necessarily choose the Condorcet winner, as strong support from a part of the
society can outweigh mediocre uniform support. On the other hand, the influence
of unpopular candidates on the outcome is smaller than in the primary technique
of consensus voting, i.e., the Borda count. We achieve that without having to
introduce an ad hoc weighting that some other methods do.",2102.01995v3,cs.MA,2021-02-03 10:50:41+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Gergei Bana'), arxiv.Result.Author('Wojciech Jamroga'), arxiv.Result.Author('David Naccache'), arxiv.Result.Author('Peter Y. A. Ryan')]",

from this moment the comparison changes from an absolute to a relative mode.
Here the implications of this paradigm shift are investigated. Significance
relations are formally established. Based on this, a trade-off between
increasing cycle-freeness of the relation and small maximum sets can be
identified, allowing for the selection of a proper significance level and
resulting ranking of a set of algorithms. The procedure is exemplified on the
CEC'05 benchmark of real parameter single objective optimization problems. The
significance relation here is based on awarding ranking points for relative

investigations of intermediate representations of a pre-trained DNN lead to an

We find that we can learn a generative classifier by statistically
characterizing the neural response of an intermediate layer to clean training
samples. The predictions of multiple such intermediate-layer based classifiers,
when aggregated, show unexpected robustness to adversarial attacks.
Specifically, we devise an ensemble of these generative classifiers that
rank-aggregates their predictions via a Borda count-based consensus. Our

arbitrary index permutations; the model incorporates the popular tensor block
models and Lipschitz hypergraphon models as special cases. We show that a
constrained least-squares estimator in the block-wise polynomial family
achieves the minimax error bound. A phase transition phenomenon is revealed
with respect to the smoothness threshold needed for optimal recovery. In
particular, we find that a polynomial of degree up to $(m-2)(m+1)/2$ is
sufficient for accurate recovery of order-$m$ tensors, whereas higher degree
exhibits no further benefits. This phenomenon reveals the intrinsic distinction

question is how to choose a scoring rule for a specific application. First, we
derive a one-parameter family with geometric scores which satisfies two
principles of independence: once an extremely strong or weak candidate is
removed, the aggregate ranking ought to remain intact. This family includes
Borda count, generalised plurality (medal count), and generalised antiplurality
(threshold rule) as edge cases, and we find which additional axioms
characterise these rules. Second, we introduce a one-parameter family with
optimal scores: the athletes should be ranked according to their expected
overall quality. Finally, using historical data from biathlon, golf, and
athletics we demonstrate how the geometric and optimal scores can simplify the
selection of suitable scoring rules, show that these scores closely resemble
the actual scores used by the organisers, and provide an explanation for
empirical phenomena observed in biathlon and golf tournaments. We see that
geometric scores approximate the optimal scores well in events where the

further spatial statistical analysis. Computer programs can assist data
scientists in preparing cartograms, but developing an algorithm that can
quickly transform every coordinate on the map (including points that are not

challenge. Methods that translate the cartographic deformations into
physics-inspired equations of motion have become popular, but solving these
equations with sufficient accuracy can still take several minutes on current
hardware. Here we introduce a flow-based algorithm whose equations of motion
are numerically easier to solve compared with previous methods. The equations
allow straightforward parallelization so that the calculation takes only a few
seconds even for complex and detailed input. Despite the speedup, the proposed
algorithm still keeps the advantages of previous techniques: with comparable
quantitative measures of shape distortion, it accurately scales all areas,
correctly fits the regions together and generates a map projection for every

by analyzing multiple datasets available at both macro and micro levels for the
New York City. Using data sources related to population density, aggregated
population mobility, public rail transit use, vehicle use, hotspot and
non-hotspot movement patterns, and human activity agglomeration, we analyzed
the inter-borough and intra-borough moment for New York City by aggregating the
data at the borough level. We also assessed the internodal population movement
amongst hotspot and non-hotspot points of interest for the month of March and
April 2020. Results indicate a drop of about 80% in people's mobility in the
city, beginning in mid-March. The movement to and from Manhattan showed the
most disruption for both public transit and road traffic. The city saw its
first case on March 1, 2020, but disruptions in mobility can be seen only after
the second week of March when the shelter in place orders was put in effect.
Owing to people working from home and adhering to stay-at-home orders,
Manhattan saw the largest disruption to both inter- and intra-borough movement.
But the risk of spread of infection in Manhattan turned out to be high because
of higher hotspot-linked movements. The stay-at-home restrictions also led to
an increased population density in Brooklyn and Queens as people were not

873,The Price of Political Uncertainty: Evidence from the 2016 U.S. Presidential Election and the U.S. Stock Markets,"There is bountiful evidence that political uncertainty stemming from
presidential elections or doubt about the direction of future policy make
financial markets significantly volatile, especially in proximity to close
elections or elections that may prompt radical policy changes. Although several
studies have examined the association between presidential elections and stock
returns, very little attention has been given to the impacts of elections and
election induced uncertainty on stock markets. This paper explores, at sectoral
level, the uncertain information hypothesis (UIH) as a means of explaining the
reaction of markets to the arrival of unanticipated information. This
hypothesis postulates that political uncertainty is greater prior to the
elections (relative to pre-election period) but is resolved once the outcome of
the elections is determined (relative to post-election period). To this end, we
adopt an event-study methodology that examines abnormal return behavior around
the election date. We show that collapsing stock returns around the election
result is reversed by positive abnormal return on the next day, except some
cases where we note negative responses following the vote count. Although
Trump's win plunges US into uncertain future, positive reactions of abnormal
return are found. Therefore, our results do not support the UIH hypothesis.
Besides, the effect of political uncertainty is sector-specific. While some
sectors emerged winners (healthcare, oil and gas, real estate, defense,
financials and consumer goods and services), others took the opposite route
(technology and utilities). The winning industries are generally those that
will benefit from the new administration's focus on rebuilding infrastructure,
renegotiating trade agreements, reforming tax policy and labour laws,
increasing defense funding, easing restrictions on energy production, and
rolling back Obamacare.",1612.06200v2,q-fin.GN,2016-12-19 14:28:59+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Jamal Bouoiyour'), arxiv.Result.Author('Refk Selmi')]",

879,Sublinear Bounds for Randomized Leader Election,"This paper concerns {\em randomized} leader election in synchronous
distributed networks. A distributed leader election algorithm is presented for
complete $n$-node networks that runs in O(1) rounds and (with high probability)
uses only $O(\sqrt{n}\log^{3/2} n)$ messages to elect a unique leader (with
high probability). When considering the ""explicit"" variant of leader election
where eventually every node knows the identity of the leader, our algorithm
yields the asymptotically optimal bounds of O(1) rounds and O(n) messages. This
algorithm is then extended to one solving leader election on any connected
non-bipartite $n$-node graph $G$ in $O(\tau(G))$ time and
$O(\tau(G)\sqrt{n}\log^{3/2} n)$ messages, where $\tau(G)$ is the mixing time
of a random walk on $G$. The above result implies highly efficient (sublinear
running time and messages) leader election algorithms for networks with small
mixing times, such as expanders and hypercubes. In contrast, previous leader
election algorithms had at least linear message complexity even in complete
graphs. Moreover, super-linear message lower bounds are known for
time-efficient {\em deterministic} leader election algorithms.
  Finally, we present an almost matching lower bound for randomized leader
election, showing that $\Omega(\sqrt n)$ messages are needed for any leader
election algorithm that succeeds with probability at least $1/e + \eps$, for
any small constant $\eps > 0$.
  We view our results as a step towards understanding the randomized complexity

880,Limiting Risk by Turning Manifest Phantoms into Evil Zombies,"Drawing a random sample of ballots to conduct a risk-limiting audit generally
requires knowing how the ballots cast in an election are organized into groups,
for instance, how many containers of ballots there are in all and how many
ballots are in each container. A list of the ballot group identifiers along
with number of ballots in each group is called a ballot manifest. What if the
ballot manifest is not accurate? Surprisingly, even if ballots are known to be
missing from the manifest, it is not necessary to make worst-case assumptions
about those ballots--for instance, to adjust the margin by the number of
missing ballots--to ensure that the audit remains conservative. Rather, it
suffices to make worst-case assumptions about the individual randomly selected
ballots that the audit cannot find. This observation provides a simple
modification to some risk-limiting audit procedures that makes them
automatically become more conservative if the ballot manifest has errors. The
modification--phantoms to evil zombies (~2EZ)--requires only an upper bound on
the total number of ballots cast. ~2EZ makes the audit P-value stochastically
larger than it would be had the manifest been accurate, automatically requiring
more than enough ballots to be audited to offset the manifest errors. This
ensures that the true risk limit remains smaller than the nominal risk limit.
On the other hand, if the manifest is in fact accurate and the upper bound on
the total number of ballots equals the total according to the manifest, ~2EZ
has no effect at all on the number of ballots audited nor on the true risk
limit.",1207.3413v1,stat.AP,2012-07-14 11:26:02+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Jorge H. Banuelos'), arxiv.Result.Author('Philip B. Stark')]",

In this study, we altered votes on a voter's ballot after they had made their
selections on a BMD. We then required them to examine their ballots for any
changes from the slate they used to vote. Overall accuracy was exceptionally
high. Participants saw 1440 total contests, and of those 1440, there were a
total of 4 errors, so total accuracy was 99.8%. Participants were able to
perform with near-perfect accuracy regardless of ballot length, ballot type,
number of altered races, and location of altered races. Detection performance
was extremely robust. We conclude that with proper direction and resources,
voters can be near-perfect detectors of ballot changes on printed paper ballots
after voting with a BMD. This finding has significant implications for the
voting community as BMD use continues to grow. Research should now focus on
identifying administrative and behavioral methods that will prompt and

malevolent adversary trying to buy real ballots. If the citizenry is divided
into subgroups (or districts), the adversary can construct a so-called ""Devil's
Menu"" consisting of several prices. In equilibrium, the adversary can buy the
real ballots of any strict subset of districts at a price corresponding to the
willingness to sell on the part of the citizens holding such ballots. By
contrast, decoy voters are trapped into selling their ballots at a low, or even
negligible, price. Blowing up the adversary's budget by introducing decoy
ballots may thus turn out to be futile. The Devil's Menu can also be applied to
the well-known ""Lemons Problem"".",1712.05477v1,cs.GT,2017-12-14 23:54:58+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Hans Gersbach'), arxiv.Result.Author('Akaki Mamageishvili'), arxiv.Result.Author('Oriol Tejada')]",
885,The ATHENA Class of Risk-Limiting Ballot Polling Audits,"The main risk-limiting ballot polling audit in use today, BRAVO, is designed
for use when single ballots are drawn at random and a decision regarding
whether to stop the audit or draw another ballot is taken after each ballot
draw (ballot-by-ballot (B2) audits). On the other hand, real ballot polling
audits draw many ballots in a single round before determining whether to stop
(round-by-round (R2) audits). We show that BRAVO results in significant
inefficiency when directly applied to real R2 audits. We present the ATHENA
class of R2 stopping rules, which we show are risk-limiting if the round
schedule is pre-determined (before the audit begins). We prove that each rule
is at least as efficient as the corresponding BRAVO stopping rule applied at
the end of the round. We have open-source software libraries implementing most
of our results.
  We show that ATHENA halves the number of ballots required, for all state
margins in the 2016 US Presidential election and a first round with $90\%$
stopping probability, when compared to BRAVO (stopping rule applied at the end
of the round). We present simulation results supporting the 90% stopping
probability claims and our claims for the risk accrued in the first round.
Further, ATHENA reduces the number of ballots by more than a quarter for low
margins, when compared to the BRAVO stopping rule applied on ballots in
selection order. This implies that keeping track of the order when drawing
ballots R2 is not beneficial, because ATHENA is more efficient even without
information on selection order. These results are significant because current
approaches to real ballot polling election audits use the B2 BRAVO rules,
requiring about twice as much work on the part of election officials. Applying
the rules in selection order requires fewer ballots, but keeping track of the
order, and entering it into audit software, adds to the effort.",2008.02315v5,cs.CR,2020-08-05 18:47:37+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Filip Zagórski'), arxiv.Result.Author('Grant McClearn'), arxiv.Result.Author('Sarah Morin'), arxiv.Result.Author('Neal McBurnett'), arxiv.Result.Author('Poorvi L.

not require identification numbers on the ballots or counting many ballots per
draw. We analyze how close the distribution of chosen ballots is to the uniform

different locations, rather than requiring a central authority to select the
sample from the whole population of cast ballots or requiring stratified
sampling; (3) it can start in polling places on election night, before margins
are known. If the reported margins for the 2016 U.S. Presidential election are
correct, a Bernoulli ballot-polling audit with a risk limit of 5% and a
sampling rate of $p_0 = 1\%$ would have had at least a 99% probability of

justifiably high confidence that the reported results of an election are
consistent with an audit trail (""ballots""), which can be paper or electronic.
SOBA combines three ideas: (1) publishing cast vote records (CVRs) separately
for each contest, so that anyone can verify that each reported contest outcome
is correct, if the CVRs reflect voters' intentions with sufficient accuracy;
(2) shrouding a mapping between ballots and the CVRs for those ballots to
prevent the loss of privacy that could occur otherwise; (3) assessing the
accuracy with which the CVRs reflect voters' intentions for a collection of
contests while simultaneously assessing the integrity of the shrouded mapping
between ballots and CVRs by comparing randomly selected ballots to the CVRs
that purport to represent them. Step (1) is related to work by the Humboldt
County Election Transparency Project, but publishing CVRs separately for
individual contests rather than images of entire ballots preserves privacy.
Step (2) requires a cryptographic commitment from elections officials.
Observers participate in step (3), which relies on the ""super-simple
simultaneous single-ballot risk-limiting audit."" Step (3) is designed to reveal
relatively few ballots if the shrouded mapping is proper and the CVRs
accurately reflect voter intent. But if the reported outcomes of the contests

Recent studies (e.g., Bernhard, et al. 2020) suggest the verification rate is

of voters being unable to do so accurately or whether this is because voters
simply choose not to attempt verification in the first place. In order to
understand this problem, we conducted an experiment in which 108 participants
participated in a mock election where the BMD displayed the voters' true
choices, but then changed a subset of those choices on the printed ballot. The
design of the printed ballot, the length of the ballot, the number of changes
that were made to the ballot, the location of those changes, and the
instructions provided to the voters were manipulated as part of the experiment.
Results indicated that of those voters who chose to examine the printed ballot,
76% detected anomalies, indicating that voters can reliably detect errors on
their ballot if they will simply review it. This suggests that administrative

comparison audit compares randomly selected digital ballots with their paper
versions. Discrepancies are referred to as errors, and are used to build
evidence against or in support of the recorded result. Risk-limiting audits for
first-past-the-post elections are well understood, and used in some US
elections. We define a number of approaches to ballot-polling and comparison
risk-limiting audits for Instant Runoff Voting (IRV) elections. We show that
for almost all real elections we found, we can perform a risk-limiting audit by
looking at only a small fraction of the total ballots (assuming no errors were
made in the tallying and distribution of votes).",1903.08804v2,cs.DS,2019-03-20 06:19:10+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Michelle Blom'), arxiv.Result.Author('Peter J. Stuckey'), arxiv.Result.Author('Vanessa Teague')]",

ballot permutation. In this paper, we present a decomposition of ballot
permutations that enables us to construct a bijection between ballot
permutations and odd order permutations, which proves a set-valued extension of
a conjecture due to Spiro using the statistic of peak values. This bijection
also preserves the neighbors of the largest letter in permutations and thus
resolves a refinement of Spiro' s conjecture proposed by Wang and Zhang. Our
decomposition can be extended to well-labelled positive paths, a class of
generalized ballot permutations arising from polytope theory, that were
enumerated by Bernardi, Duplantier and Nadeau. We will also investigate the

894,Ballot Length in Instant Runoff Voting,"Instant runoff voting (IRV) is an increasingly-popular alternative to
traditional plurality voting in which voters submit rankings over the
candidates rather than single votes. In practice, elections using IRV often
restrict the ballot length, the number of candidates a voter is allowed to rank
on their ballot. We theoretically and empirically analyze how ballot length can
influence the outcome of an election, given fixed voter preferences. We show
that there exist preference profiles over $k$ candidates such that up to $k-1$
different candidates win at different ballot lengths. We derive exact lower
bounds on the number of voters required for such profiles and provide a
construction matching the lower bound for unrestricted voter preferences.
Additionally, we characterize which sequences of winners are possible over
ballot lengths and provide explicit profile constructions achieving any
feasible winner sequence. We also examine how classic preference restrictions
influence our results--for instance, single-peakedness makes $k-1$ different
winners impossible but still allows at least $\Omega(\sqrt k)$. Finally, we
analyze a collection of 168 real-world elections, where we truncate rankings to
simulate shorter ballots. We find that shorter ballots could have changed the
outcome in one quarter of these elections. Our results highlight ballot length
as a consequential degree of freedom in the design of IRV elections.",2207.08958v3,cs.MA,2022-07-18 22:01:13+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Kiran Tomlinson'), arxiv.Result.Author('Johan Ugander'), arxiv.Result.Author('Jon Kleinberg')]",

boardroom -- in which all voters can see and hear each other. We present an
initial exploration of boardroom elections with ballot privacy and voter
verifiability that use only ""low-tech cryptography"" without using computers to
mark or collect ballots. Specifically, we define the problem, introduce several
building blocks, and propose a new protocol that combines these blocks in novel
ways. Our new building blocks include ""foldable ballots"" that can be rotated to
hide the alignment of ballot choices with voting marks, and ""visual secrets""
that are easy to remember and use but hard to describe. Although closely seated
participants in a boardroom election have limited privacy, the protocol ensures
that no one can determine how others voted. Moreover, each voter can verify
that their ballot was correctly cast, collected, and counted, without being
able to prove how they voted, providing assurance against undue influence.
Low-tech cryptography is useful in situations where constituents do not trust
computer technology, and it avoids the complex auditing requirements of
end-to-end cryptographic voting systems such as Pr\^{e}t-\`{a}-Voter. This
paper's building blocks and protocol are meant to be a proof of concept that

orbits are represented compactly using permutations over variables, and
variable-value (VV) pairs, but they can miss several state symmetries in a
domain.
  We define the notion of permutations over block-value (BV) pairs, where a
block is a set of variables. BV strictly generalizes VV symmetries, and can
compute many more symmetries for increasing block sizes. To operationalize use
of BV permutations in lifted inference, we describe 1) an algorithm to compute
BV permutations given a block partition of the variables, 2) BV-MCMC, an
extension of orbital MCMC that can sample from BV orbits, and 3) a heuristic to
suggest good block partitions. Our experiments show that BV-MCMC can mix much

problems on metric spaces, we compare voting with and without the use of
proxies to see which mechanism better approximates the optimal outcome, and
characterize the regimes in which proxy voting is beneficial. When voters'
opinions are located on an interval, both the median mechanism and the mean
mechanism are substantially improved by proxy voting. When voters vote on many
binary issues, proxy voting is better when the sample of active voters is too
small to provide a good outcome. Our theoretical results extend to situations
where available voters choose strategically whether to participate. We support
our theoretical findings with empirical results showing substantial benefits of

validators, agree on a proposed block, then this block is appended to the
blockchain. Yet, these protocols remain vulnerable to faults caused by
validators who abstain either accidentally or maliciously. To protect against
such faults while retaining the PoS selection and reward allocation schemes, we
study weighted voting in validator committees. We formalize the block creation
process and introduce validators' voting profiles which we update by a
multiplicative weights algorithm relative to validators' voting behavior and
aggregate blockchain rewards. Using this framework, we leverage weighted
majority voting rules that optimize collective decision making to show, both
numerically and analytically, that the consensus mechanism is more robust if
validators' votes are appropriately scaled. We raise potential issues and
limitations of weighted voting in trustless, decentralized networks and relate

905,Enhancing Engagement in Token-Curated Registries via an Inflationary Mechanism,"Token Curated Registries (TCR) are decentralized recommendation systems that
can be implemented using Blockchain smart contracts. They allow participants to
vote for or against adding items to a list through a process that involves
staking tokens intrinsic to the registry, with winners receiving the staked
tokens for each vote. A TCR aims to provide incentives to create a well-curated
list. In this work, we consider a challenge for these systems - incentivizing
token-holders to actually engage and participate in the voting process. We
propose a novel token-inflation mechanism for enhancing engagement, whereby
only voting participants see their token supply increased by a pre-defined
multiple after each round of voting. To evaluate this proposal, we propose a
simple 4-class model of voters that captures all possible combinations of two
key dimensions: whether they are engaged (likely to vote at all for a given
item) or disengaged, and whether they are informed (likely to vote in a way
that increases the quality of the list) or uninformed, and a simple metric to
evaluate the quality of the list as a function of the vote outcomes. We conduct
simulations using this model of voters and show that implementing
token-inflation results in greater wealth accumulation for engaged voters. In
particular, when the number of informed voters is sufficiently high, our
simulations show that voters that are both informed and engaged see the
greatest benefits from participating in the registry when our proposed
token-inflation mechanism is employed. We further validate this finding using a
simplified mathematical analysis.",1811.09680v1,cs.GT,2018-11-23 20:51:13+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Yi Lucy Wang'), arxiv.Result.Author('Bhaskar Krishnamachari')]",
906,Measuring Violations of Positive Involvement in Voting,"In the context of computational social choice, we study voting methods that
assign a set of winners to each profile of voter preferences. A voting method
satisfies the property of positive involvement (PI) if for any election in
which a candidate x would be among the winners, adding another voter to the
election who ranks x first does not cause x to lose. Surprisingly, a number of
standard voting methods violate this natural property. In this paper, we
investigate different ways of measuring the extent to which a voting method
violates PI, using computer simulations. We consider the probability (under
different probability models for preferences) of PI violations in randomly
drawn profiles vs. profile-coalition pairs (involving coalitions of different
sizes). We argue that in order to choose between a voting method that satisfies
PI and one that does not, we should consider the probability of PI violation
conditional on the voting methods choosing different winners. We should also
relativize the probability of PI violation to what we call voter potency, the
probability that a voter causes a candidate to lose. Although absolute
frequencies of PI violations may be low, after this conditioning and
relativization, we see that under certain voting methods that violate PI, much
of a voter's potency is turned against them - in particular, against their
desire to see their favorite candidate elected.",2106.11502v1,cs.GT,2021-06-22 02:46:37+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Wesley H. Holliday'), arxiv.Result.Author('Eric Pacuit')]","EPTCS 335, 2021, pp. 189-209"

any public server and there is no need for any trustee to safeguard the
legality of the election process. Even in case of an attack succeeding, the

cryptographic key material and with the responsibility to deceive their
coercers. We propose VoteAgain, a scalable voting scheme that relies on the

deterministic ballot padding mechanism to ensure that coercers cannot see
whether a vote has been replaced. This mechanism ensures tallies take
quasilinear time, making VoteAgain the first revoting scheme that can handle

voting rules such as Proportional Approval Voting (PAV) and Phragm\'en's rules
have been shown to produce committees that are proportional, in the sense that
they proportionally represent voters' preferences; all of these rules are
strategically manipulable by voters. On the other hand, a generalisation of
Approval Voting gives a non-proportional but strategyproof voting rule. We show
that there is a fundamental tradeoff between these two properties: we prove
that no multiwinner voting rule can simultaneously satisfy a weak form of
proportionality (a weakening of justified representation) and a weak form of
strategyproofness. Our impossibility is obtained using a formulation of the
problem in propositional logic and applying SAT solvers; a human-readable
version of the computer-generated proof is obtained by extracting a minimal
unsatisfiable set (MUS). We also discuss several related axiomatic questions in

racehorses are mixed on the win bet fraction axis. We see the emergence of a
scale invariant relation between the cumulative distribution function of the
winning horse $x_{1}$ and that of the losing horse $x_{0}$. $x_{1}\propto
x_{0}^{\alpha}$ holds in the small win bet fraction region. We also see the
efficiency of the market as the vote proceeds. However, the convergence to the
efficient state is not monotonic. The time change of the distribution of a vote
is complicated. Votes resume concentration on popular horses, after the
distribution spreads to a certain extent. In order to explain scale invariance,
we introduce a simple voting model. In a `double' scaling limit, we show that
the exact scale invariance relation $x_{1}=x_{0}^{\alpha}$ holds over the

913,Justice blocks and predictability of US Supreme Court votes,"Successful attempts to predict judges' votes shed light into how legal
decisions are made and, ultimately, into the behavior and evolution of the
judiciary. Here, we investigate to what extent it is possible to make
predictions of a justice's vote based on the other justices' votes in the same
case. For our predictions, we use models and methods that have been developed
to uncover hidden associations between actors in complex social networks. We
show that these methods are more accurate at predicting justice's votes than
forecasts made by legal experts and by algorithms that take into consideration
the content of the cases. We argue that, within our framework, high
predictability is a quantitative proxy for stable justice (and case) blocks,
which probably reflect stable a priori attitudes toward the law. We find that
U. S. Supreme Court justice votes are more predictable than one would expect
from an ideal court composed of perfectly independent justices. Deviations from
ideal behavior are most apparent in divided 5-4 decisions, where justice blocks
seem to be most stable. Moreover, we find evidence that justice predictability
decreased during the 50-year period spanning from the Warren Court to the
Rehnquist Court, and that aggregate court predictability has been significantly
lower during Democratic presidencies. More broadly, our results show that it is

proposed by Brams and Sanver [Electoral Studies, 25(2):287-305, 2006], and here
adjusted so as to coerce admissibility of the votes (rather than excluding
inadmissible votes a priori), with respect to procedural control. In such
control scenarios, an external agent seeks to change the outcome of an election
via actions such as adding/deleting/partitioning either candidates or voters.
SP-AV combines the voters' preference rankings with their approvals of
candidates, where in elections with at least two candidates the voters'
approval strategies are adjusted--if needed--to approve of their most-preferred
candidate and to disapprove of their least-preferred candidate. This rule
coerces admissibility of the votes even in the presence of control actions, and
hybridizes, in effect, approval with pluralitiy voting.
  We prove that this system is computationally resistant (i.e., the
corresponding control problems are NP-hard) to 19 out of 22 types of
constructive and destructive control. Thus, SP-AV has more resistances to
control than is currently known for any other natural voting system with a

919,On Some Generalizations of Batalin-Vilkovisky Algebras,"We define the concept of higher order differential operators on a general
noncommutative, nonassociative superalgebra A, and show that a vertex operator
superalgebra has plenty of them, namely modes of vertex operators. A linear
operator \Delta is a differential operator of order at most r if an inductively
defined (r+1)-form \Phi_{\Delta}^{r+1} is identically zero. When A is
supercommutative and associative and \Delta is an odd, square zero, second
order differential operator on A, \Phi_{\Delta}^2 defines a ""Batalin-Vilkovisky
algebra"" structure on A. We generalize this notion to any superalgebra with an
odd, square zero, second order differential operator, and show that all
properties of the classical BV bracket but one continue to hold ""on the nose"".
We also point out connections to Leibniz algebras and the noncommutative
homology theory of Loday. Taking the generalization process one step further,
we remove all conditions on \Delta to examine the changes in the basic
properties of the bracket. We see that a topological chiral algebra with a mild
restriction yields a classical BV algebra in the cohomology. Finally, we

proposes a novel scheme named grouping-based CADA (G-CADA) that retains the
advantages of CADA in reducing the communication load, while increasing the
robustness to stragglers at the cost of additional storage at the workers.
G-CADA partitions the workers into groups of workers that are assigned the same
data shards. Groups are scheduled adaptively at each iteration, and the server
only waits for the fastest worker in each selected group. We provide analysis

927,CADA: Multi-scale Collaborative Adversarial Domain Adaptation for Unsupervised Optic Disc and Cup Segmentation,"The diversity of retinal imaging devices poses a significant challenge:
domain shift, which leads to performance degradation when applying the deep
learning models trained on one domain to new testing domains. In this paper, we
propose a multi-scale input along with multiple domain adaptors applied
hierarchically in both feature and output spaces. The proposed training
strategy and novel unsupervised domain adaptation framework, called
Collaborative Adversarial Domain Adaptation (CADA), can effectively overcome
the challenge. Multi-scale inputs can reduce the information loss due to the
pooling layers used in the network for feature extraction, while our proposed
CADA is an interactive paradigm that presents an exquisite collaborative
adaptation through both adversarial learning and ensembling weights at
different network layers. In particular, to produce a better prediction for the
unlabeled target domain data, we simultaneously achieve domain invariance and
model generalizability via adversarial learning at multi-scale outputs from
different levels of network layers and maintaining an exponential moving
average (EMA) of the historical weights during training. Without annotating any
sample from the target domain, multiple adversarial losses in encoder and
decoder layers guide the extraction of domain-invariant features to confuse the
domain classifier. Meanwhile, the ensembling of weights via EMA reduces the
uncertainty of adapting multiple discriminator learning. Comprehensive
experimental results demonstrate that our CADA model incorporating multi-scale
input training can overcome performance degradation and outperform
state-of-the-art domain adaptation methods in segmenting retinal optic disc and
cup from fundus images stemming from the REFUGE, Drishti-GS, and Rim-One-r3

Ovals at different points in their evolution. Starting from the era with three
White Ovals FA, BC, and DE (Galileo), continuing to the post-merger epoch with
only one Oval BA (Cassini), and finally to Oval BA's current reddened state
(New Horizons), we demonstrate that the dynamics of their flow have similarly
evolved along with their appearance. The northern periphery of Oval BA
increased in speed by 20 m/s from Cassini to New Horizons, ending up at a speed
nearly identical to that of the northern periphery of Oval DE during Galileo.
However, the peak speeds along the southern rim of the newly formed Oval BA
were consistently faster than the corresponding speeds in Oval DE, and they
increased still further between Cassini and New Horizons, ending up at ~140 to
150 m/s. The modest strengthening of the winds in Oval BA, the appearance of
red aerosols, and the appearance of a turbulent, cyclonic feature to Oval BA's
northwest create a strong resemblance with the Great Red Spot from both a
dynamical and morphological perspective. In addition to the White Ovals, we
also measure the winds within two compact cyclonic regions, one in the Galileo
data set and one in the Cassini data set. In the images, these cyclonic
features appear turbulent and filamentary, but our wind field reveals that the
flow manifests as a coherent high-speed collar surrounding relatively quiescent

tested for collision with the opponent vehicles. Finally, it selects the
maneuver that maximizes progress along the track, taking into account the race

950,Jupiter's third largest and longest-lived oval: Color changes and dynamics,"The transition region between the North Equatorial Band (NEBn) and North
Tropical Zone (NTrZ) in Jupiter is home to convective storms, systems of
cyclones and anticyclones and atmospheric waves. A large anticyclone formed in
the year 2006 at planetographic latitude 19N and persists since then after a
complex dynamic history, being possibly the third longest-lived oval in the
planet after Jupiter's Great Red Spot and oval BA. This anticyclone has
experienced close interactions with other ovals, merging with another oval in
February 2013; it has also experienced color changes, from white to red
(September 2013). The oval survived the effects of the closely located North
Temperate Belt Disturbance, which occurred in October 2016 and fully covered
the oval, rendering it unobservable for a short time. When it became visible
again at its expected longitude from its previous longitudinal track, it
reappeared as a white large oval keeping this color and the same morphology
since 2017 at least until the onset of the new convective disturbance in
Jupiter's North Temperate Belt in August 2020. Here we describe the historic
evolution of the properties of this oval. We use JunoCam and Hubble Space
Telescope (HST) images to measure its size and its internal rotation. We also
used HST and PlanetCam-UPV/EHU multi-wavelength observations to characterize
its color changes and Junocam images to unveil its detailed structure. The
color and the altitude-opacity indices show that the oval is higher and has
redder clouds than its environment but has lower cloud tops than other large
ovals like the GRS, and it is less red than the GRS and oval BA. We show that
in spite of the dramatic environmental changes suffered by the oval during all
these years, its main characteristics are stable in time and therefore must be
related with the atmospheric dynamics below the observable cloud decks.",2103.13168v1,astro-ph.EP,2021-03-24 13:14:26+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('N. Barrado-Izagirre'), arxiv.Result.Author('J.

satisfying the $perspective$ property, and this paper is on characterisations

960,"More style, less work: card-style data decrease risk-limiting audit sample sizes","U.S. elections rely heavily on computers such as voter registration
databases, electronic pollbooks, voting machines, scanners, tabulators, and
results reporting websites. These introduce digital threats to election
outcomes. Risk-limiting audits (RLAs) mitigate threats to some of these systems
by manually inspecting random samples of ballot cards. RLAs have a large chance
of correcting wrong outcomes (by conducting a full manual tabulation of a
trustworthy record of the votes), but can save labor when reported outcomes are
correct. This efficiency is eroded when sampling cannot be targeted to ballot
cards that contain the contest(s) under audit. If the sample is drawn from all
cast cards, RLA sample sizes scale like the reciprocal of the fraction of
ballot cards that contain the contest(s) under audit. That fraction shrinks as
the number of cards per ballot grows (i.e., when elections contain more
contests) and as the fraction of ballots that contain the contest decreases
(i.e., when a smaller percentage of voters are eligible to vote in the
contest). States that conduct RLAs of contests on multi-card ballots or of
small contests can dramatically reduce sample sizes by using information about
which ballot cards contain which contests -- by keeping track of card-style
data (CSD). For instance, CSD reduces the expected number of draws needed to
audit a single countywide contest on a 4-card ballot by 75%. Similarly, CSD
reduces the expected number of draws by 95% or more for an audit of two
contests with the same margin on a 4-card ballot if one contest is on every
ballot and the other is on 10% of ballots. In realistic examples, the savings
can be several orders of magnitude.",2012.03371v1,cs.CR,2020-12-06 20:35:12+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Amanda K. Glazer'), arxiv.Result.Author('Jacob V. Spertus'), arxiv.Result.Author('Philip B. Stark')]",
961,Non(c)esuch Ballot-Level Risk-Limiting Audits for Precinct-Count Voting Systems,"Risk-limiting audits (RLAs) guarantee a high probability of correcting
incorrect reported outcomes before the outcomes are certified. The most
efficient use ballot-level comparison, comparing the voting system's
interpretation of individual ballot cards sampled at random (cast-vote records,
CVRs) from a trustworthy paper trail to a human interpretation of the same
cards. Such comparisons require the voting system to create and export CVRs in
a way that can be linked to the individual ballots the CVRs purport to
represent. Such links can be created by keeping the ballots in the order in
which they are scanned or by printing a unique serial number on each ballot.
But for precinct-count systems (PCOS), these strategies may compromise vote
anonymity: the order in which ballots are cast may identify the voters who cast
them. Printing a unique pseudo-random number (""cryptographic nonce"") on each
ballot card after the voter last touches it could reduce such privacy risks.
But what if the system does not in fact print a unique number on each ballot or
does not accurately report the numbers it printed? This paper gives two ways to
conduct an RLA so that even if the system does not print a genuine nonce on
each ballot or misreports the nonces it used, the audit's risk limit is not
compromised (however, the anonymity of votes might be compromised). One method
allows untrusted technology to be used to imprint and to retrieve ballot cards.
The method is adaptive: if the technology behaves properly, this protection
does not increase the audit workload. But if the imprinting or retrieval system
misbehaves, the sample size the RLA requires to confirm the reported results
when the results are correct is generally larger than if the imprinting and
retrieval were accurate.",2207.01362v1,cs.CR,2022-07-04 12:35:42+00:00,[arxiv.Result.Author('Philip B. Stark')],

Surprisingly this had gone undetected, even as the field was score-carding how
many std. control types election systems were resistant to; various ""different""
cells on such score cards were, unknowingly, duplicate effort on the same
issue. This naturally raises the worry that other pairs of control types are
also identical, and so work still is being needlessly duplicated.
  We determine, for all std. control types, which pairs are, for elections
whose votes are linear orderings of the candidates, always identical. We show
that no identical control pairs exist beyond the known 7. We for 3 central
election systems determine which control pairs are identical (""collapse"") with
respect to those systems, and we explore containment/incomparability
relationships between control pairs. For approval voting, which has a different
""type"" for its votes, [HHM20]'s 7 collapses still hold. But we find 14
additional collapses that hold for approval voting but not for some election
systems whose votes are linear orderings. We find 1 additional collapse for

classify its separation in terms of containment (always, and strict on some

identify voting scenarios in which uncertainty about the voting method may

for auditing more complex social choice functions, including some preferential

the majority voting method is most stable to this random vote corruption, among
voting methods where each person has a small influence on the election. We

Moreover, scenarios such as committee or board elections require voting rules
that return multiple winners. In multi-winner approval voting (AV), an agent
may vote for as many candidates as they wish. Winners are chosen by tallying up
the votes and choosing the top-$k$ candidates receiving the most votes. An
agent may manipulate the vote to achieve a better outcome by voting in a way
that does not reflect their true preferences. In complex and uncertain
situations, agents may use heuristics to strategize, instead of incurring the
additional effort required to compute the manipulation which most favors them.
In this paper, we examine voting behavior in multi-winner approval voting
scenarios with complete information. We show that people generally manipulate
their vote to obtain a better outcome, but often do not identify the optimal
manipulation. Instead, voters tend to prioritize the candidates with the
highest utilities. Using simulations, we demonstrate the effectiveness of these
heuristics in situations where agents only have access to partial information.",1905.12104v2,cs.GT,2019-05-28 21:44:07+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Jaelle Scheuerman'), arxiv.Result.Author('Jason L. Harman'), arxiv.Result.Author('Nicholas Mattei'), arxiv.Result.Author('K. Brent Venable')]",
975,Bucklin Voting is Broadly Resistant to Control,"Electoral control models ways of changing the outcome of an election via such
actions as adding/deleting/partitioning either candidates or voters. These
actions modify an election's participation structure and aim at either making a
favorite candidate win (""constructive control"") or prevent a despised candidate
from winning (""destructive control""), which yields a total of 22 standard
control scenarios. To protect elections from such control attempts,
computational complexity has been used to show that electoral control, though
not impossible, is computationally prohibitive. Among natural voting systems
with a polynomial-time winner problem, the two systems with the highest number
of proven resistances to control types (namely 19 out of 22) are
""sincere-strategy preference-based approval voting"" (SP-AV, a modification of a
system proposed by Brams and Sanver) and fallback voting. Both are hybrid
systems; e.g., fallback voting combines approval with Bucklin voting. In this
paper, we study the control complexity of Bucklin voting itself and show that
it behaves equally well in terms of control resistance for the 20 cases
investigated so far. As Bucklin voting is a special case of fallback voting,
all resistances shown for Bucklin voting in this paper strengthen the
corresponding resistance for fallback voting.",1005.4115v1,cs.CC,2010-05-22 09:12:04+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Gábor Erdélyi'), arxiv.Result.Author('Lena Piras'), arxiv.Result.Author('Jörg Rothe')]",

980,Limiting Risk by Turning Manifest Phantoms into Evil Zombies,"Drawing a random sample of ballots to conduct a risk-limiting audit generally
requires knowing how the ballots cast in an election are organized into groups,
for instance, how many containers of ballots there are in all and how many
ballots are in each container. A list of the ballot group identifiers along
with number of ballots in each group is called a ballot manifest. What if the
ballot manifest is not accurate? Surprisingly, even if ballots are known to be
missing from the manifest, it is not necessary to make worst-case assumptions
about those ballots--for instance, to adjust the margin by the number of
missing ballots--to ensure that the audit remains conservative. Rather, it
suffices to make worst-case assumptions about the individual randomly selected
ballots that the audit cannot find. This observation provides a simple
modification to some risk-limiting audit procedures that makes them
automatically become more conservative if the ballot manifest has errors. The
modification--phantoms to evil zombies (~2EZ)--requires only an upper bound on
the total number of ballots cast. ~2EZ makes the audit P-value stochastically
larger than it would be had the manifest been accurate, automatically requiring
more than enough ballots to be audited to offset the manifest errors. This
ensures that the true risk limit remains smaller than the nominal risk limit.
On the other hand, if the manifest is in fact accurate and the upper bound on
the total number of ballots equals the total according to the manifest, ~2EZ
has no effect at all on the number of ballots audited nor on the true risk
limit.",1207.3413v1,stat.AP,2012-07-14 11:26:02+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Jorge H. Banuelos'), arxiv.Result.Author('Philip B. Stark')]",

justifiably high confidence that the reported results of an election are
consistent with an audit trail (""ballots""), which can be paper or electronic.
SOBA combines three ideas: (1) publishing cast vote records (CVRs) separately
for each contest, so that anyone can verify that each reported contest outcome
is correct, if the CVRs reflect voters' intentions with sufficient accuracy;
(2) shrouding a mapping between ballots and the CVRs for those ballots to
prevent the loss of privacy that could occur otherwise; (3) assessing the
accuracy with which the CVRs reflect voters' intentions for a collection of
contests while simultaneously assessing the integrity of the shrouded mapping
between ballots and CVRs by comparing randomly selected ballots to the CVRs
that purport to represent them. Step (1) is related to work by the Humboldt
County Election Transparency Project, but publishing CVRs separately for
individual contests rather than images of entire ballots preserves privacy.
Step (2) requires a cryptographic commitment from elections officials.
Observers participate in step (3), which relies on the ""super-simple
simultaneous single-ballot risk-limiting audit."" Step (3) is designed to reveal
relatively few ballots if the shrouded mapping is proper and the CVRs
accurately reflect voter intent. But if the reported outcomes of the contests
differ from the outcomes that a full hand count would show, step (3) is
guaranteed to have a large chance of requiring all the ballots to be counted by
hand, thereby limiting the risk that an incorrect outcome will become official

984,Non(c)esuch Ballot-Level Risk-Limiting Audits for Precinct-Count Voting Systems,"Risk-limiting audits (RLAs) guarantee a high probability of correcting
incorrect reported outcomes before the outcomes are certified. The most
efficient use ballot-level comparison, comparing the voting system's
interpretation of individual ballot cards sampled at random (cast-vote records,
CVRs) from a trustworthy paper trail to a human interpretation of the same
cards. Such comparisons require the voting system to create and export CVRs in
a way that can be linked to the individual ballots the CVRs purport to
represent. Such links can be created by keeping the ballots in the order in
which they are scanned or by printing a unique serial number on each ballot.
But for precinct-count systems (PCOS), these strategies may compromise vote
anonymity: the order in which ballots are cast may identify the voters who cast
them. Printing a unique pseudo-random number (""cryptographic nonce"") on each
ballot card after the voter last touches it could reduce such privacy risks.
But what if the system does not in fact print a unique number on each ballot or
does not accurately report the numbers it printed? This paper gives two ways to
conduct an RLA so that even if the system does not print a genuine nonce on
each ballot or misreports the nonces it used, the audit's risk limit is not
compromised (however, the anonymity of votes might be compromised). One method
allows untrusted technology to be used to imprint and to retrieve ballot cards.
The method is adaptive: if the technology behaves properly, this protection
does not increase the audit workload. But if the imprinting or retrieval system
misbehaves, the sample size the RLA requires to confirm the reported results
when the results are correct is generally larger than if the imprinting and
retrieval were accurate.",2207.01362v1,cs.CR,2022-07-04 12:35:42+00:00,[arxiv.Result.Author('Philip B. Stark')],

986,Adaptive Risk-Limiting Ballot Comparison Audits,"Risk-limiting audits (RLAs) are rigorous statistical procedures meant to
detect invalid election results. RLAs examine paper ballots cast during the
election to statistically assess the possibility of a disagreement between the
winner determined by the ballots and the winner reported by tabulation. The
most ballot efficient approaches proceed by ""ballot comparison."" However,
ballot comparison requires an untrusted declaration of the contents of each
cast ballot, rather than a simple tabulation of vote totals. This ""cast-vote
record table"" (CVR) is then spot-checked against ballots for consistency. In
many practical settings, the cost of generating a suitable CVR dominates the
cost of conducting the audit, preventing widespread adoption of these
sample-efficient techniques.
  We introduce a new RLA procedure: an ""adaptive ballot comparison"" audit. In
this audit, a global CVR is never produced; instead, a three-stage procedure is
iterated:
  1) a batch is selected,
  2) a CVR is produced for that batch, and
  3) a ballot within the batch is sampled, inspected by auditors, and compared
with the CVR.
  We prove that such an audit can achieve risk commensurate with standard
comparison audits while generating a fraction of the CVR. We present three main
contributions:
  1) a formal adversarial model for RLAs;
  2) definition and analysis of an adaptive audit procedure with rigorous risk
limits and an associated correctness analysis accounting for the incidental
errors arising in typical audits; and
  3) an analysis of practical efficiency.
  This method can be organized in rounds (as is typical for comparison audits)
where sampled CVRs are produced in parallel. Using data from Florida's 2020
presidential election with 5% risk and 1% margin, only 22% of the CVR is
generated; at 10% margin, only 2% is generated.",2202.02607v5,cs.CR,2022-02-05 18:04:27+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Benjamin Fuller'), arxiv.Result.Author('Abigail Harrison'), arxiv.Result.Author('Alexander Russell')]",

988,"More style, less work: card-style data decrease risk-limiting audit sample sizes","U.S. elections rely heavily on computers such as voter registration
databases, electronic pollbooks, voting machines, scanners, tabulators, and
results reporting websites. These introduce digital threats to election
outcomes. Risk-limiting audits (RLAs) mitigate threats to some of these systems
by manually inspecting random samples of ballot cards. RLAs have a large chance
of correcting wrong outcomes (by conducting a full manual tabulation of a
trustworthy record of the votes), but can save labor when reported outcomes are
correct. This efficiency is eroded when sampling cannot be targeted to ballot
cards that contain the contest(s) under audit. If the sample is drawn from all
cast cards, RLA sample sizes scale like the reciprocal of the fraction of
ballot cards that contain the contest(s) under audit. That fraction shrinks as
the number of cards per ballot grows (i.e., when elections contain more
contests) and as the fraction of ballots that contain the contest decreases
(i.e., when a smaller percentage of voters are eligible to vote in the
contest). States that conduct RLAs of contests on multi-card ballots or of
small contests can dramatically reduce sample sizes by using information about
which ballot cards contain which contests -- by keeping track of card-style
data (CSD). For instance, CSD reduces the expected number of draws needed to
audit a single countywide contest on a 4-card ballot by 75%. Similarly, CSD
reduces the expected number of draws by 95% or more for an audit of two
contests with the same margin on a 4-card ballot if one contest is on every
ballot and the other is on 10% of ballots. In realistic examples, the savings
can be several orders of magnitude.",2012.03371v1,cs.CR,2020-12-06 20:35:12+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Amanda K. Glazer'), arxiv.Result.Author('Jacob V. Spertus'), arxiv.Result.Author('Philip B. Stark')]",

actually cast their vote. So far, the combination of ballot stuffing and
participation privacy has been mostly studied for internet voting, where voters
are assumed to own trusted computing devices. Such approaches are inapplicable
to pollsite voting where voters typically vote bare handed. We present an
eligibility audit protocol to detect ballot stuffing in pollsite voting
protocols. This is done while protecting participation privacy from a remote
observer - one who does not physically observe voters during voting. Our
protocol can be instantiated as an additional layer on top of most existing
pollsite E2E-V voting protocols. To achieve our guarantees, we develop an
efficient zero-knowledge proof (ZKP), that, given a value $v$ and a set $\Phi$
of commitments, proves $v$ is committed by some commitment in $\Phi$, without
revealing which one. We call this a ZKP of reverse set membership because of
its relationship to the popular ZKPs of set membership. This ZKP may be of
independent interest.",2210.14833v1,cs.CR,2022-10-26 16:29:23+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Prashant Agrawal'), arxiv.Result.Author('Abhinav Nakarmi'), arxiv.Result.Author('Mahabir Prasad Jhanwar'), arxiv.Result.Author('Subodh Sharma'), arxiv.Result.Author('Subhashis Banerjee')]",
990,Sets of Half-Average Nulls Generate Risk-Limiting Audits: SHANGRLA,"Risk-limiting audits (RLAs) for many social choice functions can be reduced
to testing sets of null hypotheses of the form ""the average of this list is not
greater than 1/2"" for a collection of finite lists of nonnegative numbers. Such
social choice functions include majority, super-majority, plurality,
multi-winner plurality, Instant Runoff Voting (IRV), Borda count, approval
voting, and STAR-Voting, among others. The audit stops without a full hand
count iff all the null hypotheses are rejected. The nulls can be tested in many
ways. Ballot-polling is particularly simple; two new ballot-polling
risk-measuring functions for sampling without replacement are given.
Ballot-level comparison audits transform each null into an equivalent assertion
that the mean of re-scaled tabulation errors is not greater than 1/2. In turn,
that null can then be tested using the same statistical methods used for ballot
polling---but applied to different finite lists of nonnegative numbers.
SHANGRLA comparison audits are more efficient than previous comparison audits
for two reasons: (i) for most social choice functions, the conditions tested
are both necessary and sufficient for the reported outcome to be correct, while
previous methods tested conditions that were sufficient but not necessary, and
(ii) the tests avoid a conservative approximation. The SHANGRLA abstraction
simplifies stratified audits, including audits that combine ballot polling with
ballot-level comparisons, producing sharper audits than the ""SUITE"" approach.
SHANGRLA works with the ""phantoms to evil zombies"" strategy to treat missing
ballot cards and missing or redacted cast vote records. That also facilitates
sampling from ""ballot-style manifests,"" which can dramatically improve
efficiency when the audited contests do not appear on every ballot card.

991,Risk-Limiting Audits by Stratified Union-Intersection Tests of Elections (SUITE),"Risk-limiting audits (RLAs) offer a statistical guarantee: if a full manual
tally of the paper ballots would show that the reported election outcome is
wrong, an RLA has a known minimum chance of leading to a full manual tally.
RLAs generally rely on random samples. Stratified sampling--partitioning the
population of ballots into disjoint strata and sampling independently from the
strata--may simplify logistics or increase efficiency compared to simpler
sampling designs, but makes risk calculations harder. We present SUITE, a new
method for conducting RLAs using stratified samples. SUITE considers all
possible partitions of outcome-changing error across strata. For each
partition, it combines P-values from stratum-level tests into a combined
P-value; there is no restriction on the tests used in different strata. SUITE
maximizes the combined P-value over all partitions of outcome-changing error.
The audit can stop if that maximum is less than the risk limit. Voting systems
in some Colorado counties (comprising 98.2% of voters) allow auditors to check
how the system interpreted each ballot, which allows ballot-level comparison
RLAs. Other counties use ballot polling, which is less efficient. Extant
approaches to conducting an RLA of a statewide contest would require major
changes to Colorado's procedures and software, or would sacrifice the
efficiency of ballot-level comparison. SUITE does not. It divides ballots into
two strata: those cast in counties that can conduct ballot-level comparisons,
and the rest. Stratum-level P-values are found by methods derived here. The
resulting audit is substantially more efficient than statewide ballot polling.
SUITE is useful in any state with a mix of voting systems or that uses
stratified sampling for other reasons. We provide an open-source reference
implementation and exemplar calculations in Jupyter notebooks.",1809.04235v1,stat.AP,2018-09-12 02:56:22+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Kellie Ottoboni'), arxiv.Result.Author('Philip B. Stark'), arxiv.Result.Author('Mark Lindeman'), arxiv.Result.Author('Neal McBurnett')]",

participants in a boardroom election have limited privacy, the protocol ensures

while BAs are based on Bayesian inference. Until recently, the two have been
thought of as fundamentally different.
  We present results that unify and shed light upon 'ballot-polling' RLAs and
BAs (which only require the ability to sample uniformly at random from all cast
ballot cards) for two-candidate plurality contests, which are building blocks
for auditing more complex social choice functions, including some preferential
voting systems. We highlight the connections between the methods and explore
their performance.
  First, building on a previous demonstration of the mathematical equivalence
of classical and Bayesian approaches, we show that BAs, suitably calibrated,
are risk-limiting. Second, we compare the efficiency of the methods across a
wide range of contest sizes and margins, focusing on the distribution of sample
sizes required to attain a given risk limit. Third, we outline several ways to
improve performance and show how the mathematical equivalence explains the
improvements.",2008.08536v2,stat.AP,2020-08-19 16:30:03+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Zhuoqun Huang'), arxiv.Result.Author('Ronald L. Rivest'), arxiv.Result.Author('Philip B.

997,Blocks as geographic discontinuities: The effect of polling place assignment on voting,"A potential voter must incur a number of costs in order to successfully cast
an in-person ballot, including the costs associated with identifying and
traveling to a polling place. In order to investigate how these costs affect
voting behavior, we introduce two quasi-experimental designs that can be used
to study how the political participation of registered voters is affected by
differences in the relative distance that registrants must travel to their
assigned Election Day polling place and whether their polling place remains at
the same location as in a previous election. Our designs make comparisons of
registrants who live on the same residential block, but are assigned to vote at
different polling places. We find that living farther from a polling place and
being assigned to a new polling place reduce in-person Election Day voting, but
that registrants largely offset for this by casting more early in-person and
mail ballots.",2105.01728v1,stat.AP,2021-05-04 19:50:27+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Sabina Tomkins'), arxiv.Result.Author('Keniel Yao'), arxiv.Result.Author('Johann Gaebler'), arxiv.Result.Author('Tobias Konitzer'), arxiv.Result.Author('David Rothschild'), arxiv.Result.Author('Marc Meredith'), arxiv.Result.Author('Sharad Goel')]",

win by ranking some other candidate. This suggests a reason that voters should
be allowed to rank at most four candidates. I identify all pivotal events in

probabilities in a common framework for voting games. I provide pseudocode, and

999,BVOT: Self-Tallying Boardroom Voting with Oblivious Transfer,"A boardroom election is an election with a small number of voters carried out
with public communications. We present BVOT, a self-tallying boardroom voting
protocol with ballot secrecy, fairness (no tally information is available
before the polls close), and dispute-freeness (voters can observe that all
voters correctly followed the protocol).
  BVOT works by using a multiparty threshold homomorphic encryption system in
which each candidate is associated with a masked unique prime. Each voter
engages in an oblivious transfer with an untrusted distributor: the voter
selects the index of a prime associated with a candidate and receives the
selected prime in masked form. The voter then casts their vote by encrypting
their masked prime and broadcasting it to everyone. The distributor does not
learn the voter's choice, and no one learns the mapping between primes and
candidates until the audit phase. By hiding the mapping between primes and
candidates, BVOT provides voters with insufficient information to carry out
effective cheating. The threshold feature prevents anyone from computing any
partial tally---until everyone has voted. Multiplying all votes, their
decryption shares, and the unmasking factor yields a product of the primes each
raised to the number of votes received.
  In contrast to some existing boardroom voting protocols, BVOT does not rely
on any zero-knowledge proof; instead, it uses oblivious transfer to assure
ballot secrecy and correct vote casting. Also, BVOT can handle multiple
candidates in one election. BVOT prevents cheating by hiding crucial
information: an attempt to increase the tally of one candidate might increase
the tally of another candidate. After all votes are cast, any party can tally
the votes.",2010.02421v1,cs.CR,2020-10-06 01:28:34+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Farid Javani'), arxiv.Result.Author('Alan T. Sherman')]",

incorrect reported outcomes before the outcomes are certified. The most
efficient use ballot-level comparison, comparing the voting system's
interpretation of individual ballot cards sampled at random (cast-vote records,
CVRs) from a trustworthy paper trail to a human interpretation of the same
cards. Such comparisons require the voting system to create and export CVRs in
a way that can be linked to the individual ballots the CVRs purport to
represent. Such links can be created by keeping the ballots in the order in
which they are scanned or by printing a unique serial number on each ballot.
But for precinct-count systems (PCOS), these strategies may compromise vote
anonymity: the order in which ballots are cast may identify the voters who cast
them. Printing a unique pseudo-random number (""cryptographic nonce"") on each
ballot card after the voter last touches it could reduce such privacy risks.
But what if the system does not in fact print a unique number on each ballot or
does not accurately report the numbers it printed? This paper gives two ways to
conduct an RLA so that even if the system does not print a genuine nonce on
each ballot or misreports the nonces it used, the audit's risk limit is not
compromised (however, the anonymity of votes might be compromised). One method
allows untrusted technology to be used to imprint and to retrieve ballot cards.
The method is adaptive: if the technology behaves properly, this protection
does not increase the audit workload. But if the imprinting or retrieval system
misbehaves, the sample size the RLA requires to confirm the reported results
when the results are correct is generally larger than if the imprinting and
retrieval were accurate.",2207.01362v1,cs.CR,2022-07-04 12:35:42+00:00,[arxiv.Result.Author('Philip B. Stark')],

1007,Bayesian Tabulation Audits: Explained and Extended,"Tabulation audits for an election provide statistical evidence that a
reported contest outcome is ""correct"" (meaning that the tabulation of votes was
properly performed), or else the tabulation audit determines the correct
outcome.
  Stark proposed risk-limiting tabulation audits for this purpose; such audits
are effective and are beginning to be used in practice.
  We expand the study of election audits based on Bayesian methods, first
introduced by Rivest and Shen in 2012. (The risk-limiting audits proposed by
Stark are ""frequentist"" rather than Bayesian in character.)
  We first provide a simplified presentation of Bayesian tabulation audits. A
Bayesian tabulation audit begins by drawing a random sample of the votes in
that contest, and tallying those votes. It then considers what effect
statistical variations of this tally have on the contest outcome. If such
variations almost always yield the previously-reported outcome, the audit
terminates, accepting the reported outcome. Otherwise the audit is repeated
with an enlarged sample.
  Bayesian audits are attractive because they work with any method for
determining the winner (such as ranked-choice voting).
  We then show how Bayesian audits may be extended to handle more complex
situations, such as auditing contests that \emph{span multiple jurisdictions},
or are otherwise ""stratified.""
  We highlight the auditing of such multiple-jurisdiction contests where some
of the jurisdictions have an electronic cast vote record (CVR) for each cast
paper vote, while the others do not. Complex situations such as this may arise
naturally when some counties in a state have upgraded to new equipment, while
others have not. Bayesian audits are able to handle such situations in a
straightforward manner.
  We also discuss the benefits and relevant considerations for using Bayesian
audits in practice.",1801.00528v2,cs.CR,2018-01-02 00:00:15+00:00,[arxiv.Result.Author('Ronald L. Rivest')],

in this framework can be classified as instances of either strategic
overshooting (too many voted strategically) or strategic undershooting (too
few). If mis-coordination can result in strategic voters ending up worse off
than they would have been had they all just voted sincerely, we call the
relevant strategic vote unsafe. We show that under every onto and
non-dictatorial social choice rule there exist circumstances where a voter has

the outcome of the election the same, regardless of the changes to the votes.
It is well known that the US electoral college system is about 5 times more
likely to have a changed outcome due to vote corruption, when compared to a
majority vote. In fact, Mossel, O'Donnell and Oleszkiewicz proved in 2005 that
the majority voting method is most stable to this random vote corruption, among
voting methods where each person has a small influence on the election. We
discuss some recent progress on the analogous result for elections between more
than two candidates. In this case, plurality should be most stable to
corruption in votes. We also survey results on adversarial election
manipulation (where an adversary can select particular votes to change, perhaps
in a non-random way), and we briefly discuss ranked choice voting methods

compensation for all votes that are not necessary to win the district (negative

in the greatest expected seat share, however, application of PVT, and,
especially, NVT increases the probability of winning the election. The

1018,Adaptive Risk-Limiting Ballot Comparison Audits,"Risk-limiting audits (RLAs) are rigorous statistical procedures meant to
detect invalid election results. RLAs examine paper ballots cast during the
election to statistically assess the possibility of a disagreement between the
winner determined by the ballots and the winner reported by tabulation. The
most ballot efficient approaches proceed by ""ballot comparison."" However,
ballot comparison requires an untrusted declaration of the contents of each
cast ballot, rather than a simple tabulation of vote totals. This ""cast-vote
record table"" (CVR) is then spot-checked against ballots for consistency. In
many practical settings, the cost of generating a suitable CVR dominates the
cost of conducting the audit, preventing widespread adoption of these
sample-efficient techniques.
  We introduce a new RLA procedure: an ""adaptive ballot comparison"" audit. In
this audit, a global CVR is never produced; instead, a three-stage procedure is
iterated:
  1) a batch is selected,
  2) a CVR is produced for that batch, and
  3) a ballot within the batch is sampled, inspected by auditors, and compared
with the CVR.
  We prove that such an audit can achieve risk commensurate with standard
comparison audits while generating a fraction of the CVR. We present three main
contributions:
  1) a formal adversarial model for RLAs;
  2) definition and analysis of an adaptive audit procedure with rigorous risk
limits and an associated correctness analysis accounting for the incidental
errors arising in typical audits; and
  3) an analysis of practical efficiency.
  This method can be organized in rounds (as is typical for comparison audits)

1019,Sets of Half-Average Nulls Generate Risk-Limiting Audits: SHANGRLA,"Risk-limiting audits (RLAs) for many social choice functions can be reduced
to testing sets of null hypotheses of the form ""the average of this list is not
greater than 1/2"" for a collection of finite lists of nonnegative numbers. Such
social choice functions include majority, super-majority, plurality,
multi-winner plurality, Instant Runoff Voting (IRV), Borda count, approval
voting, and STAR-Voting, among others. The audit stops without a full hand
count iff all the null hypotheses are rejected. The nulls can be tested in many
ways. Ballot-polling is particularly simple; two new ballot-polling
risk-measuring functions for sampling without replacement are given.
Ballot-level comparison audits transform each null into an equivalent assertion
that the mean of re-scaled tabulation errors is not greater than 1/2. In turn,
that null can then be tested using the same statistical methods used for ballot
polling---but applied to different finite lists of nonnegative numbers.
SHANGRLA comparison audits are more efficient than previous comparison audits
for two reasons: (i) for most social choice functions, the conditions tested
are both necessary and sufficient for the reported outcome to be correct, while
previous methods tested conditions that were sufficient but not necessary, and
(ii) the tests avoid a conservative approximation. The SHANGRLA abstraction
simplifies stratified audits, including audits that combine ballot polling with
ballot-level comparisons, producing sharper audits than the ""SUITE"" approach.
SHANGRLA works with the ""phantoms to evil zombies"" strategy to treat missing
ballot cards and missing or redacted cast vote records. That also facilitates
sampling from ""ballot-style manifests,"" which can dramatically improve
efficiency when the audited contests do not appear on every ballot card.
Open-source software implementing SHANGRLA ballot-level comparison audits is
available.",1911.10035v4,stat.AP,2019-11-22 13:32:46+00:00,[arxiv.Result.Author('Philip B. Stark')],

1028,Characterizing Properties and Trade-offs of Centralized Delegation Mechanisms in Liquid Democracy,"Liquid democracy is a form of transitive delegative democracy that has
received a flurry of scholarly attention from the computer science community in
recent years. In its simplest form, every agent starts with one vote and may
have other votes assigned to them via delegation from other agents. They can
choose to delegate all votes assigned to them to another agent or vote directly
with all votes assigned to them. However, many proposed realizations of liquid
democracy allow for agents to express their delegation/voting preferences in
more complex ways (e.g., a ranked list of potential delegates) and employ a
centralized delegation mechanism to compute the final vote tally. In doing so,
centralized delegation mechanisms can make decisions that affect the outcome of
a vote and where/whether agents are able to delegate their votes. Much of the
analysis thus far has focused on the ability of these mechanisms to make a
correct choice. We extend this analysis by introducing and formalizing other
important properties of a centralized delegation mechanism in liquid democracy
with respect to crucial features such as accountability, transparency,
explainability, fairness, and user agency. In addition, we evaluate existing
methods in terms of these properties, show how some prior work can be augmented

swapping the positions of two consecutive candidates in their preference order,

on the tournament graph (like Copeland) respectively. We argue that with an
elimination style voting rule like single transferable vote, partial voting
does not change the situations where strategic voting is possible. However,
with scoring rules and rules based on the tournament graph, partial voting can
increase the situations where strategic voting is possible. As a consequence,
the computational complexity of computing a strategic vote can change. For
example, with Borda count, the complexity of computing a strategic vote can
decrease or stay the same depending on how we score partial votes.",1405.7714v1,cs.GT,2014-05-28 12:13:52+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Nina Narodytska'), arxiv.Result.Author('Toby Walsh')]",

aggregate preferences of the society. To this end, the techniques of social
choice theory are often utilized. We propose a new social choice function

the Condorcet graph of pairwise comparisons. To this end, we transform the
Condorcet graph into a Markov chain whose stationary distribution provides the
scores of the options. We show how the values in the stationary distribution

which the community of voters converges through an imaginary sequence of
negotiating steps. Because of that, we suggest the name ""convergence voting""
for the new voting scheme, and ""negotiated community support"" for the resulting
stationary allocation of scores.
  Our social choice function can be viewed as a consensus voting method,
sitting somewhere between Copeland and Borda. On the one hand, it does not
necessarily choose the Condorcet winner, as strong support from a part of the
society can outweigh mediocre uniform support. On the other hand, the influence
of unpopular candidates on the outcome is smaller than in the primary technique

1044,Square Kilometre Array station configuration using two-stage beamforming,"The lowest frequency band (70 - 450 MHz) of the Square Kilometre Array will
consist of sparse aperture arrays grouped into geographically-localised
patches, or stations. Signals from thousands of antennas in each station will
be beamformed to produce station beams which form the inputs for the central
correlator. Two-stage beamforming within stations can reduce SKA-low signal
processing load and costs, but has not been previously explored for the
irregular station layouts now favoured in radio astronomy arrays. This paper
illustrates the effects of two-stage beamforming on sidelobes and effective
area, for two representative station layouts (regular and irregular gridded
tile on an irregular station). The performance is compared with a single-stage,
irregular station. The inner sidelobe levels do not change significantly
between layouts, but the more distant sidelobes are affected by the tile
layouts; regular tile creates diffuse, but regular, grating lobes. With very
sparse arrays, the station effective area is similar between layouts. At lower
frequencies, the regular tile significantly reduces effective area, hence
sensitivity. The effective area is highest for a two-stage irregular station,
but it requires a larger station extent than the other two layouts. Although
there are cost benefits for stations with two-stage beamforming, we conclude
that more accurate station modelling, and SKA-low configuration specifications,
are required before design finalisation.",1211.4932v1,astro-ph.IM,2012-11-21 04:26:57+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Aziz Jiwani'), arxiv.Result.Author('Tim Colegate'), arxiv.Result.Author('Nima Razavi-Ghods'), arxiv.Result.Author('Peter J Hall'), arxiv.Result.Author('Shantanu Padhi'), arxiv.Result.Author('Jan Geralt bij de Vaate')]",

Brunner. Svalgaard re-counted some 60,000 sunspots on drawings from the
reference station Locarno and determined that the number of sunspots reported
were 'over counted' by 44% on average, leading to an inflation (measured by a
weight factor) in excess of 1.2 for high solar activity. In a double-blind
parallel counting by the Locarno observer Cagnotti, we determined that
Svalgaard's count closely matches that of Cagnotti's, allowing us to determine
the daily weight factor since 2003 (and sporadically before). We find that a
simple empirical equation fits the observed weight factors well, and use that
fit to estimate the weight factor for each month back to the introduction of
weighting in 1947 and thus to be able to correct for the over-count and to
reduce sunspot counting without weighting to the Wolfer method in use from 1893

1048,Centralities for Networks with Consumable Resources,"Identification of influential nodes is an important step in understanding and
controlling the dynamics of information, traffic and spreading processes in
networks. As a result, a number of centrality measures have been proposed and
used across different application domains. At the heart of many of these
measures, lies an assumption describing the manner in which traffic (of
information, social actors, particles, etc.) flows through the network. For
example, some measures only count shortest paths while others consider random
walks.
  This paper considers a spreading process in which a resource necessary for
transit is partially consumed along the way while being refilled at special
nodes on the network. Examples include fuel consumption of vehicles together
with refueling stations, information loss during dissemination with error
correcting nodes, and consumption of ammunition of military troops while
moving.
  We propose generalizations of the well-known measures of betweenness, random
walk betweenness, and Katz centralities to take such a spreading process with
consumable resources into account. In order to validate the results,
experiments on real-world networks are carried out by developing simulations
based on well-known models such as Susceptible-Infected-Recovered and
congestion with respect to particle hopping from vehicular flow theory. The

counts. The expansion factors, derived from the permanent traffic count
stations, are applied to the short-term counts for AADT estimation. The
inherent challenges of the factor-based method (i.e., grouping the count
stations, applying proper expansion factors) make the estimated AADT values
erroneous. Based on a survey conducted by the authors, 97% of the 39 public
transportation agencies use the factor-based AADT estimation model, and these

AADT at a particular location from the short-term counts collected at those

1050,A Stochastic Analysis of Bike Sharing Systems,"As more people move back into densely populated cities, bike sharing is
emerging as an important mode of urban mobility. In a typical bike sharing
system, riders arrive at a station and take a bike if it is available. After
retrieving a bike, they ride it for a while, then return it to a station near
their final destinations. Since space is limited in cities, each station has a
finite capacity of docks, which cannot hold more bikes than its capacity. In
this paper, we study bike sharing systems with stations having a finite
capacity. By an appropriate scaling of our stochastic model, we prove a central
limit theorem for an empirical process of the number of stations with $k$
bikes. The central limit theorem provides insight on the variance, and sample
path dynamics of large scale bike sharing systems. We also leverage our results
to estimate confidence intervals for various performance measures such as the
proportion of empty stations, the proportion of full stations, and the number
of bikes in circulation. These performance measures have the potential to
inform the operations and design of future bike sharing systems.",1708.08052v2,math.PR,2017-08-27 05:18:04+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Shuang Tao'), arxiv.Result.Author('Jamol Pender')]",

different stations in the system at the network-level. Although prediction
errors were slightly lower in the case of univariate models, we found that the
multivariate model results were promising for the network-level prediction,

are spatially correlated. Moreover, results of the station-level analysis
suggested that demographic information and other environmental variables were
significant factors to model bikes in BSSs. We also demonstrated that the

state-of-the-art decentralized SLAM components into a new, complete

co-optimization, existing decentralized visual SLAM systems regularly exchange
the full map data between all robots, incurring large data transfers at a
complexity that scales quadratically with the robot count. In contrast, our
method performs efficient data association in two stages: in the first stage a
compact full-image descriptor is deterministically sent to only one robot. In
the second stage, which is only executed if the first stage succeeded, the data
required for relative pose estimation is sent, again to only one robot. Thus,
data association scales linearly with the robot count and uses highly compact
place representations. For optimization, a state-of-the-art decentralized

1054,Coordinated Charging Station Search in Stochastic Environments: A Multi-Agent Approach,"Range and charge anxiety remain essential barriers to a faster electric
vehicle market diffusion. To this end, quickly and reliably finding suitable
charging stations may foster an electric vehicle uptake by mitigating drivers'
anxieties. Here, existing commercial services help drivers to find available
stations based on real-time availability data but struggle with data
inaccuracy, e.g., due to conventional vehicles blocking the access to public
charging stations. In this context, recent works have studied stochastic search
methods to account for availability uncertainty in order to minimize a driver's
detour until reaching an available charging station. So far, both practical and
theoretical approaches ignore driver coordination enabled by charging requests
centralization or sharing of data, e.g., sharing observations of charging
stations' availability or visit intentions between drivers. Against this
background, we study coordinated stochastic search algorithms, which help to
reduce station visit conflicts and improve the drivers' charging experience. We
model a multi-agent stochastic charging station search problem as a
finite-horizon Markov decision process and introduce an online solution
framework applicable to static and dynamic policies. In contrast to static
policies, dynamic policies account for information updates during policy
planning and execution. We present a hierarchical implementation of a
single-agent heuristic for decentralized decision making and a rollout
algorithm for centralized decision making. Extensive numerical studies show
that compared to an uncoordinated setting, a decentralized setting with
visit-intentions sharing decreases the system cost by 26%, which is nearly as
good as the 28% cost decrease achieved in a centralized setting, and saves up
to 23% of a driver's search time while increasing her search reliability.",2204.14219v1,eess.SY,2022-04-26 14:36:04+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Marianne Guillet'), arxiv.Result.Author('Maximilian Schiffer')]",

impacts on the power grid have become non-negligible. Though charging stations

conventional ""one charging station, one battery storage"" method may be
uneconomical due to the high upfront cost of battery storage. Shared energy
storage can be a potential solution. However, effective management of charging
stations with shared energy storage in a distribution network is challenging
due to the complex coupling, competing interests, and information asymmetry
between different agents. To address the aforementioned challenges, this paper
proposes a distributed coordination mechanism, with a prediction and a
correction step, to guide the behaviors of different agents. In particular,
three groups of strategic agents are involved. Each charging station determines
the flexible EV charging plan inside it; each shared energy storage operator
decides on the amount of energy provided to its connected charging stations;
and the distribution system operator monitors power flow in the network. We
theoretically prove that the proposed mechanism will converge to the centrally
optimal solution. Numerical experiments and comprehensive performance

federal systems has been motivated by the idea that they possess desirable
traits not provided by democracies on a single scale. Yet most existing models

with heterogeneous political geographies. We begin by developing a framework to
describe the multilevel distribution of opinions and analyze the flow of
variance among geographic scales, applying it to historical data in the United

the spatial distribution of opinions and how tradeoffs occur between national

opinion, for which we show that a decrease in local salience can constrain the
dimensions along which elections occur, preventing a federal system from

context of the 2021 Mexican Legislative Election. To do so, we use a dataset of
15 million election-related tweets in the six months preceding election day. We
explore different election models that assign political preference to either
the ruling parties or the opposition. We find that models using data with
geographical attributes determine the results of the election with better
precision and accuracy than conventional polling methods. These results
demonstrate that analysis of public online data can outperform conventional
polling methods, and that political analysis and general forecasting would
likely benefit from incorporating such data in the immediate future. Moreover,
the same Twitter dataset with geographical attributes is positively correlated
with results from official census data on population and internet usage in
Mexico. These findings suggest that we have reached a period in time when
online activity, appropriately curated, can provide an accurate representation
of offline behaviour.",2301.00626v1,cs.SI,2023-01-02 12:40:05+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Alejandro Vigna-Gómez'), arxiv.Result.Author('Javier Murillo'), arxiv.Result.Author('Manelik Ramirez'), arxiv.Result.Author('Alberto Borbolla'), arxiv.Result.Author('Ian Márquez'), arxiv.Result.Author('Prasun K.

1068,Election Forensics and the 2004 Venezuelan Presidential Recall Referendum as a Case Study,"A referendum to recall President Hugo Ch\'{a}vez was held in Venezuela in
August of 2004. In the referendum, voters were to vote YES if they wished to
recall the President and NO if they wanted him to continue in office. The
official results were 59% NO and 41% YES. Even though the election was
monitored by various international groups including the Organization of
American States and the Carter Center (both of which declared that the
referendum had been conducted in a free and transparent manner), the outcome of
the election was questioned by other groups both inside and outside of
Venezuela. The collection of manuscripts that comprise this issue of

remarkably high correlation between turnout and voting results; (ii) a large
number of polling stations where the UR/Putin results are given by a round
number of percent; (iii) constituencies showing improbably low or (iv)
anomalously high dispersion of results across polling stations; (v) substantial
difference between results at paper-based and electronic polling stations.

that amplifies official information while personalizing it to users' unique
needs transparently. We discuss its design, build prototypes with frequently

1071,SOBA: Secrecy-preserving Observable Ballot-level Audit,"SOBA is an approach to election verification that provides observers with
justifiably high confidence that the reported results of an election are
consistent with an audit trail (""ballots""), which can be paper or electronic.
SOBA combines three ideas: (1) publishing cast vote records (CVRs) separately
for each contest, so that anyone can verify that each reported contest outcome
is correct, if the CVRs reflect voters' intentions with sufficient accuracy;
(2) shrouding a mapping between ballots and the CVRs for those ballots to
prevent the loss of privacy that could occur otherwise; (3) assessing the
accuracy with which the CVRs reflect voters' intentions for a collection of
contests while simultaneously assessing the integrity of the shrouded mapping
between ballots and CVRs by comparing randomly selected ballots to the CVRs
that purport to represent them. Step (1) is related to work by the Humboldt
County Election Transparency Project, but publishing CVRs separately for
individual contests rather than images of entire ballots preserves privacy.
Step (2) requires a cryptographic commitment from elections officials.
Observers participate in step (3), which relies on the ""super-simple
simultaneous single-ballot risk-limiting audit."" Step (3) is designed to reveal
relatively few ballots if the shrouded mapping is proper and the CVRs
accurately reflect voter intent. But if the reported outcomes of the contests
differ from the outcomes that a full hand count would show, step (3) is
guaranteed to have a large chance of requiring all the ballots to be counted by
hand, thereby limiting the risk that an incorrect outcome will become official

election cycles is meant to prevent corruption and other misbehavior by elected
officials and to keep them accountable in service of the ``will of the people.""
This democratic ideal can be undermined when candidates are dishonest when
campaigning for election over these multiple cycles or rounds of voting. Much
of the work on COMSOC to date has investigated strategic actions in only a
single round. We introduce a novel formal model of \emph{pandering}, or
strategic preference reporting by candidates seeking to be elected, and examine
the resilience of two democratic voting systems to pandering within a single
round and across multiple rounds. The two voting systems we compare are
Representative Democracy (RD) and Flexible Representative Democracy (FRD). For
each voting system, our analysis centers on the types of strategies candidates
employ and how voters update their views of candidates based on how the
candidates have pandered in the past. We provide theoretical results on the
complexity of pandering in our setting for a single cycle, formulate our
problem for multiple cycles as a Markov Decision Process, and use reinforcement
learning to study the effects of pandering by both single candidates and groups
of candidates across a number of rounds.",2211.09986v1,cs.MA,2022-11-18 02:19:28+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Xiaolin Sun'), arxiv.Result.Author('Jacob Masur'), arxiv.Result.Author('Ben Abramowitz'), arxiv.Result.Author('Nicholas Mattei'), arxiv.Result.Author('Zizhan Zheng')]",

career concerns are strong, officials will inefficiently initiate reforms to

quality of reform policymaking, the central government must hold officials
accountable to policy outcomes. We demonstrate that the central government can
exercise this accountability by requiring officials to publicize policy
outcomes while maintain secrecy on implementation details. In this situation,
officials can signal their congruence only through a desirable policy outcome,
so they are highly motivated to carry out a reform well. We also demonstrate
that the accountability on policy outcomes is infeasible under alternative
policymaking environments. We apply the results to China's recent practice in
decentralized reform policymaking.",2012.01331v7,econ.GN,2020-12-02 17:02:09+00:00,[arxiv.Result.Author('Liqun Liu')],

myriad of malicious actors aspire to influence election outcomes for financial

perceptions of the voting public about select candidates, for example, through
misinformation. We present a formal model of the impact of perception
manipulation on election outcomes in the framework of spatial voting theory, in
which the preferences of voters over candidates are generated based on their
relative distance in the space of issues. We show that controlling elections in
this model is, in general, NP-hard, whether issues are binary or real-valued.
However, we demonstrate that critical to intractability is the diversity of
opinions on issues exhibited by the voting public. When voter views lack
diversity, and we can instead group them into a small number of categories --
for example, as a result of political polarization -- the election control
problem can be solved in polynomial time in the number of issues and candidates

performed without sound scientific rigour do not yield representative results.
Yet, both inside and outside Belarus it is of great importance to obtain
precise estimates of the ratings of all candidates. These ratings could
function as reliable proxies for the election's outcomes. We conduct an
independent poll based on the combination of the data collected via Viber and
on the streets of Belarus. The Viber and the street data samples consist of
almost 45000 and 1150 unique observations respectively. Bayesian regressions
with poststratification were build to estimate ratings of the candidates and
rates of early voting turnout for the population as a whole and within various
focus subgroups. We show that both the officially announced results of the
election and early voting rates are highly improbable. With a probability of at
least 95%, Sviatlana Tikhanouskaya's rating lies between 75% and 80%, whereas
Aliaksandr Lukashenka's rating lies between 13% and 18% and early voting rate
predicted by the method ranges from 9% to 13% of those who took part in the
election. These results contradict the officially announced outcomes, which are
10.12%, 80.11%, and 49.54% respectively and lie far outside even the 99.9%
credible intervals predicted by our model. The only marginal groups of people
where the upper bounds of the 99.9% credible intervals of the rating of
Lukashenka are above 50% are people older than 60 and uneducated people. For
all other marginal subgroups, including rural residents, even the upper bounds
of 99.9% credible intervals for Lukashenka are far below 50%. The same is true
for the population as a whole. Thus, with a probability of at least 99.9%
Lukashenka could not have had enough electoral support to win the 2020

have practical constraints: time is of the essence, and voting systems need to

spanning theory, applied cryptography, practical systems analysis, usable
security, and statistics. Election integrity involves two key concepts:
convincing evidence that outcomes are correct and privacy, which amounts to

1080,Fully automated quantification of in vivo viscoelasticity of prostate zones using magnetic resonance elastography with Dense U-net segmentation,"Magnetic resonance elastography (MRE) for measuring viscoelasticity heavily
depends on proper tissue segmentation, especially in heterogeneous organs such
as the prostate. Using trained network-based image segmentation, we
investigated if MRE data suffice to extract anatomical and viscoelastic
information for automatic tabulation of zonal mechanical properties of the
prostate. Overall, 40 patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) or
prostate cancer (PCa) were examined with three magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
sequences: T2-weighted MRI (T2w), diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI), and
MRE-based tomoelastography yielding six independent sets of imaging data per
patient (T2w, DWI, apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), MRE magnitude, shear
wave speed, and loss angle maps). Combinations of these data were used to train
Dense U-nets with manually segmented masks of the entire prostate gland (PG),
central zone (CZ), and peripheral zone (PZ) in 30 patients and to validate them
in 10 patients. Dice score (DS), sensitivity, specificity, and Hausdorff
distance were determined. We found that segmentation based on MRE magnitude
maps alone (DS, PG: 0.93$\pm$0.04, CZ: 0.95$\pm$0.03, PZ: 0.77$\pm$0.05) was
more accurate than magnitude maps combined with T2w and DWI_b (DS, PG:

we examine the impact on BBN of the recent compilation of nuclear data and
thermonuclear reactions rates by the NACRE collaboration. We confirm that the
adopted rates do not make large overall changes in central values of
predictions, but do affect the magnitude of the uncertainties in these
predictions. Therefore, we then examine in detail the uncertainties in the
individual reaction rates considered by NACRE. When the error estimates by
NACRE are treated as 1\sigma limits, the resulting BBN error budget is similar
to those of previous tabulations. We propose two new procedures for deriving
reaction rate uncertainties from the nuclear data: one which sets lower limits
to the error, and one which we believe is a reasonable description of the
present error budget. We propagate these uncertainty estimates through the BBN
code, and find that when the nuclear data errors are described most accurately,
the resulting light element uncertainties are notably smaller than in some
previous tabulations, but larger than others. Using these results, we derive
limits on the cosmic baryon-to-photon ratio $\eta$, and compare this to
independent limits on $\eta$ from recent balloon-borne measurements of the

increasing support from recent comparisons of observations with light curve
predictions and modeling of synthetic spectra. It explains SN Ia events via
thermonuclear explosions of accreting white dwarfs in binary stellar systems,
being caused by central carbon ignition when the white dwarf approaches the
Chandrasekhar mass. As the electron gas in white dwarfs is degenerate,
characterized by high Fermi energies for the high density regions in the
center, electron capture on intermediate mass and Fe-group nuclei plays an
important role in explosive burning. Electron capture affects the central
electron fraction Y_e, which determines the composition of the ejecta from such

with ${\cal O}(\alpha_s^3 )$ matrix element results and parton showers based

matrix element for the first leg of the parton shower, but also includes the
effects of approximate all-orders quark and gluon emission. We also evaluate
expected jet activity in top pair events at hadron supercolliders; in
particular, a comparison of the jet activity in the far forward region is made.

supernova remnants have moderately strong magnetic fields $B\sim10^{11}$ G.
Meanwhile, available models of partially ionized hydrogen atmospheres of

1098,A Catalog of Diffuse Interstellar Bands in the Spectrum of HD 204827,"Echelle spectra of the double-lined spectroscopic binary HD 204827 were
obtained on five nights, at a resolving power R = 38,000 and with a S/N ratio =
750 near 6000 A in the final, combined spectrum. The stars show E(B-V) = 1.11
and spectral types near O9.5V and B0.5III. A catalog is presented of 380
diffuse interstellar bands (DIBs) measured between 3900 and 8100 A in the
stars' spectrum. The central wavelengths, the widths (FWHM), and the equivalent
widths of nearly all of the bands are tabulated, along with the minimum
uncertainties in the latter. The reliable removal of very weak stellar lines
from the catalog, and of some stellar lines from the less severe blends with
DIBs, is made generally easy by the highly variable radial velocities of both
stars. The principal result of this investigation is that the great majority of
the bands in the catalog are very weak and relatively narrow. Typical
equivalent widths amount to a few mA, and the band widths (FWHM) are most often
near 0.55 A. Therefore, most of these DIBs can be detected only in spectra
obtained at a resolving power and a S/N ratio at least comparable to those used
here. In addition, the anomalous interstellar reddening and the very high value
of the ratio N(C2)/E(B-V) seen toward HD 204827 indicate that the physical
conditions in one or more of the several interstellar clouds seen in this
direction differ significantly from those found toward the prototypical DIB
target HD 183143, for example. Probably primarily for these reasons, 113 of the
380 bands, or 30%, were not detected in four previous, modern surveys of the

depends on proper tissue segmentation, especially in heterogeneous organs such
as the prostate. Using trained network-based image segmentation, we
investigated if MRE data suffice to extract anatomical and viscoelastic
information for automatic tabulation of zonal mechanical properties of the
prostate. Overall, 40 patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) or
prostate cancer (PCa) were examined with three magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
sequences: T2-weighted MRI (T2w), diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI), and
MRE-based tomoelastography yielding six independent sets of imaging data per
patient (T2w, DWI, apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), MRE magnitude, shear
wave speed, and loss angle maps). Combinations of these data were used to train
Dense U-nets with manually segmented masks of the entire prostate gland (PG),
central zone (CZ), and peripheral zone (PZ) in 30 patients and to validate them
in 10 patients. Dice score (DS), sensitivity, specificity, and Hausdorff
distance were determined. We found that segmentation based on MRE magnitude
maps alone (DS, PG: 0.93$\pm$0.04, CZ: 0.95$\pm$0.03, PZ: 0.77$\pm$0.05) was
more accurate than magnitude maps combined with T2w and DWI_b (DS, PG:
0.91$\pm$0.04, CZ: 0.91$\pm$0.06, PZ: 0.63$\pm$0.16) or T2w alone (DS, PG:
0.92$\pm$0.03, CZ: 0.91$\pm$0.04, PZ: 0.65$\pm$0.08). Automatically tabulated
MRE values were not different from ground-truth values (P>0.05). In conclusion:
MRE combined with Dense U-net segmentation allows tabulation of quantitative
imaging markers without manual analysis and independent of other MRI sequences

1105,The NACRE Thermonuclear Reaction Compilation and Big Bang Nucleosynthesis,"The theoretical predictions of big bang nucleosynthesis (BBN) are dominated
by uncertainties in the input nuclear reaction cross sections. In this paper,
we examine the impact on BBN of the recent compilation of nuclear data and
thermonuclear reactions rates by the NACRE collaboration. We confirm that the
adopted rates do not make large overall changes in central values of
predictions, but do affect the magnitude of the uncertainties in these
predictions. Therefore, we then examine in detail the uncertainties in the
individual reaction rates considered by NACRE. When the error estimates by
NACRE are treated as 1\sigma limits, the resulting BBN error budget is similar
to those of previous tabulations. We propose two new procedures for deriving
reaction rate uncertainties from the nuclear data: one which sets lower limits
to the error, and one which we believe is a reasonable description of the
present error budget. We propagate these uncertainty estimates through the BBN
code, and find that when the nuclear data errors are described most accurately,
the resulting light element uncertainties are notably smaller than in some
previous tabulations, but larger than others. Using these results, we derive
limits on the cosmic baryon-to-photon ratio $\eta$, and compare this to
independent limits on $\eta$ from recent balloon-borne measurements of the
cosmic microwave background radiation (CMB). We discuss means to improve the
BBN results via key nuclear reaction measurements and light element

increasing support from recent comparisons of observations with light curve

thermonuclear explosions of accreting white dwarfs in binary stellar systems,
being caused by central carbon ignition when the white dwarf approaches the
Chandrasekhar mass. As the electron gas in white dwarfs is degenerate,
characterized by high Fermi energies for the high density regions in the
center, electron capture on intermediate mass and Fe-group nuclei plays an
important role in explosive burning. Electron capture affects the central
electron fraction Y_e, which determines the composition of the ejecta from such

1113,An Estimate of Jet Activity in $t\bar t$ Events,"We present a calculation of jet activity associated with pair production of
top quarks at hadron colliders and supercolliders. Our approach is based upon a
merger of $2\rightarrow 3$ matrix elements with initial and final state parton
showers. We tabulate expected multi-jet rates in $t\bar t$ events, and compare
with ${\cal O}(\alpha_s^3 )$ matrix element results and parton showers based
upon $2\rightarrow 2$ subprocesses. The merged calculation includes the correct
matrix element for the first leg of the parton shower, but also includes the
effects of approximate all-orders quark and gluon emission. We also evaluate
expected jet activity in top pair events at hadron supercolliders; in
particular, a comparison of the jet activity in the far forward region is made.
It is found that the merged calculation yields more jet activity in the forward
region than pure matrix element estimates, but also more jet activity in the
central region. This can be important for background calculations to
$H\rightarrow WW$ and strong $WW$ scattering processes.",hep-ph/9307207v1,hep-ph,1993-07-01 17:42:31+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('H. Baer'), arxiv.Result.Author('C. H. Chen'), arxiv.Result.Author('M. H. Reno')]",Phys.Rev. D48 (1993) 5168-5174

mass density, correcting for hitherto unknown dependencies on the Hubble
constant, which, in some cases, had led to an underestimation of the mass
density by factors of ~2. Correcting for this, we note that the majority of

supernova remnants have moderately strong magnetic fields $B\sim10^{11}$ G.
Meanwhile, available models of partially ionized hydrogen atmospheres of

G. We extend the equation of state and radiative opacities, presented in
previous papers for $10^{12}\mbox{ G}\lesssim B \lesssim 10^{15}$ G, to weaker
fields. An equation of state and radiative opacities for a partially ionized
hydrogen plasma are obtained at magnetic fields $B$, temperatures $T$, and

1118,A Catalog of Diffuse Interstellar Bands in the Spectrum of HD 204827,"Echelle spectra of the double-lined spectroscopic binary HD 204827 were
obtained on five nights, at a resolving power R = 38,000 and with a S/N ratio =
750 near 6000 A in the final, combined spectrum. The stars show E(B-V) = 1.11
and spectral types near O9.5V and B0.5III. A catalog is presented of 380
diffuse interstellar bands (DIBs) measured between 3900 and 8100 A in the
stars' spectrum. The central wavelengths, the widths (FWHM), and the equivalent
widths of nearly all of the bands are tabulated, along with the minimum
uncertainties in the latter. The reliable removal of very weak stellar lines
from the catalog, and of some stellar lines from the less severe blends with
DIBs, is made generally easy by the highly variable radial velocities of both
stars. The principal result of this investigation is that the great majority of
the bands in the catalog are very weak and relatively narrow. Typical
equivalent widths amount to a few mA, and the band widths (FWHM) are most often
near 0.55 A. Therefore, most of these DIBs can be detected only in spectra
obtained at a resolving power and a S/N ratio at least comparable to those used
here. In addition, the anomalous interstellar reddening and the very high value
of the ratio N(C2)/E(B-V) seen toward HD 204827 indicate that the physical
conditions in one or more of the several interstellar clouds seen in this
direction differ significantly from those found toward the prototypical DIB
target HD 183143, for example. Probably primarily for these reasons, 113 of the

consider an adversarial setting where the voters are partitioned into two sets.
The first set votes in a stochastic manner according to the popular score-based
Bradley-Terry-Luce (BTL) model for pairwise comparisons. The second set
comprises malicious Byzantine voters trying to deteriorate the ranking. We
consider a strongly-adversarial scenario where the Byzantine voters know the
BTL scores, the votes of the good voters, the algorithm, and can collude with
each other. We first show that the popular spectral ranking based
Rank-Centrality algorithm, though optimal for the BTL model, does not perform
well even when a small constant fraction of the voters are Byzantine. We
introduce the Byzantine Spectral Ranking Algorithm (and a faster variant of
it), which produces a reliable ranking when the number of good voters exceeds
the number of Byzantine voters. We show that no algorithm can produce a
satisfactory ranking with probability > 1/2 for all BTL weights when there are
more Byzantine voters than good voters, showing that our algorithm works for
all possible population fractions. We support our theoretical results with
experimental results on synthetic and real datasets to demonstrate the failure

developing voting methods is that there can be cycles in this graph, where
candidate $\mathsf{A}$ defeats candidate $\mathsf{B}$, $\mathsf{B}$ defeats
$\mathsf{C}$, and $\mathsf{C}$ defeats $\mathsf{A}$. In this paper we apply the
central limit theorem, graph homology, and linear algebra to analyze how likely
such situations are to occur for large numbers of voters. There is a large

dishonest and did not correctly process his ballot while the authority claims

relevant disputes for a generic, practically relevant, class of voting
protocols. Based on our characterization, we propose a new definition of
dispute resolution for voting that accounts for the possibility that both
voters and the voting authority can make false claims and that voters may
abstain from voting.
  A central aspect of our work is timeliness: a voter should possess the
evidence required to resolve disputes no later than the election's end. We
characterize what assumptions are necessary and sufficient for timeliness in
terms of a communication topology for our voting protocol class. We formalize
the dispute resolution properties and communication topologies symbolically.
This provides the basis for verification of dispute resolution for a broad
class of protocols. To demonstrate the utility of our model, we analyze a
mixnet-based voting protocol and prove that it satisfies dispute resolution as
well as verifiability and receipt-freeness. To prove our claims, we combine

Motivated by recent progress in algorithmic robust statistics, we revisit the
fundamental problem of estimating the central ranking in a Mallows model, but
ask for an estimator that is provably robust, unlike the MLE.
  Our main result is an efficiently computable estimator that achieves nearly
optimal robustness guarantees. In particular the robustness guarantees are
dimension-independent in the sense that our overall accuracy does not depend on
the number of alternatives being ranked. As an immediate consequence, we show
that while the landmark Gibbard-Satterthwaite theorem tells us a strong
impossiblity result about designing strategy-proof voting rules, there are
quantitatively strong ways to protect against large coalitions if we assume
that the remaining voters voters are honest and their preferences are sampled

local differential privacy (LDP) mechanism is adopted such that the true
preference of a voter is never revealed in pre-election polls? In this case,
the attacker can only infer stochastic information about a voter's true
preference, and this may cause the manipulation of the electoral result
significantly harder. The goal of this paper is to provide a quantitative study
on the effect of adopting LDP mechanisms on a voting system. We introduce the
metric PoLDP (power of LDP) that quantitatively measures the difference between
the attacker's manipulation cost under LDP mechanisms and that without LDP
mechanisms. The larger PoLDP is, the more robustness LDP mechanisms can add to

each party can be assigned multiple seats. Two central requirements in this
setting are proportional representation and strategyproofness. Intuitively,
proportional representation requires that every sufficiently large group of
voters with similar preferences is represented in the committee.
Strategyproofness demands that no voter can benefit by misreporting her true
preferences. We show that these two axioms are incompatible for anonymous
party-approval multiwinner voting rules, thus proving a far-reaching
impossibility theorem. The proof of this result is obtained by formulating the
problem in propositional logic and then letting a SAT solver show that the
formula is unsatisfiable. Additionally, we demonstrate how to circumvent this
impossibility by considering a weakening of strategy\-proofness which requires
that only voters who do not approve any elected party cannot manipulate. While
most common voting rules fail even this weak notion of strategyproofness, we
characterize Chamberlin--Courant approval voting within the class of Thiele

1136,Voting with Limited Information and Many Alternatives,"The traditional axiomatic approach to voting is motivated by the problem of
reconciling differences in subjective preferences. In contrast, a dominant line
of work in the theory of voting over the past 15 years has considered a
different kind of scenario, also fundamental to voting, in which there is a
genuinely ""best"" outcome that voters would agree on if they only had enough
information. This type of scenario has its roots in the classical Condorcet
Jury Theorem; it includes cases such as jurors in a criminal trial who all want
to reach the correct verdict but disagree in their inferences from the
available evidence, or a corporate board of directors who all want to improve
the company's revenue, but who have different information that favors different
options.
  This style of voting leads to a natural set of questions: each voter has a
{\em private signal} that provides probabilistic information about which option
is best, and a central question is whether a simple plurality voting system,
which tabulates votes for different options, can cause the group decision to
arrive at the correct option. We show that plurality voting is powerful enough
to achieve this: there is a way for voters to map their signals into votes for
options in such a way that --- with sufficiently many voters --- the correct
option receives the greatest number of votes with high probability. We show
further, however, that any process for achieving this is inherently expensive
in the number of voters it requires: succeeding in identifying the correct
option with probability at least $1 - \eta$ requires $\Omega(n^3 \epsilon^{-2}
\log \eta^{-1})$ voters, where $n$ is the number of options and $\epsilon$ is a

global minima for aluminium, gold and platinum metal clusters modelled by the
Voter-Chen version of the embedded-atom model potential containing up to 80
atoms. The virtue of the Voter-Chen potentials is that they are derived by
fitting to experimental data of both diatomic molecules and bulk metals
simultaneously. Therefore, it may be more appropriate for a wide range of the
size of the clusters. This is important since almost all properties of the
small clusters are size dependent. The results show that the global minima of

networks at the the heterogeneous mean-field (HMF) level that (i) yields a
unified picture for existing copy/invasion processes and (ii) allows for the
introduction of further heterogeneity through degree-selectivity rules. In the
context of the HMF approximation, our model is capable of providing
straightforward estimates for central quantities such as the exit probability
and the consensus/fixation time, based on the statistical properties of the
complex network alone. The HMF approach has the advantage of being readily
applicable also in those cases in which exact solutions are difficult to work
out. Finally, the unified formalism allows one to understand previously
proposed voter-like processes as simple limits of the generalized model.",1106.4215v2,physics.soc-ph,2011-06-21 14:26:31+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Paolo Moretti'), arxiv.Result.Author('Suyu Liu'), arxiv.Result.Author('Andrea Baronchelli'), arxiv.Result.Author('Romualdo Pastor-Satorras')]",Eur.

inference, in which individual-level associations are inferred from labeled
data available only at the aggregate level. We model aggregate count data as

individual-level probabilities to individual covariates using both a logistic
regression and a neural network. A normal approximation is derived via the
Lyapunov Central Limit Theorem, allowing us to efficiently fit these models on
large datasets. We apply this technique to the problem of revealing voter
preferences in the 2016 presidential election, fitting a model to a sample of
over four million voters from the highly contested swing state of Pennsylvania.
We validate the model at the precinct level via a holdout set, and at the

edges. The preferences of a node extend naturally to preferences over
branchings, i.e., directed forests; a branching $B$ is popular if $B$ does not
lose a head-to-head election (where nodes cast votes) against any branching.
Such popular branchings have a natural application in liquid democracy. The
popular branching problem is to decide if $G$ admits a popular branching or
not. We give a characterization of popular branchings in terms of dual
certificates and use this characterization to design an efficient combinatorial
algorithm for the popular branching problem. When preferences are weak
rankings, we use our characterization to formulate the popular branching
polytope in the original space and also show that our algorithm can be modified
to compute a branching with least unpopularity margin. When preferences are

1146,Identifying Possible Winners in Ranked Choice Voting Elections with Outstanding Ballots,"Several election districts in the US have recently moved to ranked-choice
voting (RCV) to decide the results of local elections. RCV allows voters to
rank their choices, and the results are computed in rounds, eliminating one
candidate at a time. RCV ensures fairer elections and has been shown to
increase elected representation of women and people of color. A main drawback
of RCV is that the round-by-round process requires all the ballots to be
tallied before the results of an election can be calculated. With increasingly
large portions of ballots coming from absentee voters, RCV election outcomes
are not always apparent on election night, and can take several weeks to be
published, leading to a loss of trust in the electoral process from the public.
In this paper, we present an algorithm for efficiently computing possible
winners of RCV elections from partially known ballots and evaluate it on data
from the recent New York City Primary elections. We show that our techniques

Successful programs rely on both emerging technical methods and specific design

review indicates that the field currently focuses on self-certification and

exclusion of process management certifications. Additionally, the paper
considers prospects for future AI certification programs. Ongoing changes in AI

theory of interior-point methods for convex optimization, we introduce the
concept of dual cone certificates, which allows us to interpret vectors from
the dual of the sum-of-squares cone as rigorous nonnegativity certificates of a
WSOS polynomial. Whereas conventional WSOS certificates are alternative
representations of the polynomials they certify, dual certificates are distinct
from the certified polynomials; moreover, each dual certificate certifies a
full-dimensional convex cone of WSOS polynomials. As a result, rational WSOS
certificates can be constructed from numerically computed dual certificates at
little additional cost, without any rounding or projection steps applied to the
numerical certificates. As an additional algorithmic application, we present an
almost entirely numerical hybrid algorithm for computing the optimal WSOS lower
bound of a given polynomial along with a rational dual certificate, with a
polynomial-time computational cost per iteration and linear rate of
convergence.",2105.11369v2,math.OC,2021-05-24 15:58:33+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Maria M. Davis'), arxiv.Result.Author('Dávid Papp')]",
1151,A Meta-Theorem for Distributed Certification,"Distributed certification, whether it be proof-labeling schemes, locally
checkable proofs, etc., deals with the issue of certifying the legality of a
distributed system with respect to a given boolean predicate. A certificate is
assigned to each process in the system by a non-trustable oracle, and the
processes are in charge of verifying these certificates, so that two properties
are satisfied: completeness, i.e., for every legal instance, there is a
certificate assignment leading all processes to accept, and soundness, i.e.,
for every illegal instance, and for every certificate assignment, at least one
process rejects. The verification of the certificates must be fast, and the
certificates themselves must be small. A large quantity of results have been
produced in this framework, each aiming at designing a distributed
certification mechanism for specific boolean predicates. This paper presents a
""meta-theorem"", applying to many boolean predicates at once. Specifically, we
prove that, for every boolean predicate on graphs definable in the monadic
second-order (MSO) logic of graphs, there exists a distributed certification
mechanism using certificates on $O(\log^2n)$ bits in $n$-node graphs of bounded
treewidth, with a verification protocol involving a single round of

1152,DRLGENCERT: Deep Learning-based Automated Testing of Certificate Verification in SSL/TLS Implementations,"The Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) and Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocols
are the foundation of network security. The certificate verification in SSL/TLS
implementations is vital and may become the weak link in the whole network
ecosystem. In previous works, some research focused on the automated testing of
certificate verification, and the main approaches rely on generating massive
certificates through randomly combining parts of seed certificates for fuzzing.
Although the generated certificates could meet the semantic constraints, the
cost is quite heavy, and the performance is limited due to the randomness. To
fill this gap, in this paper, we propose DRLGENCERT, the first framework of
applying deep reinforcement learning to the automated testing of certificate
verification in SSL/TLS implementations. DRLGENCERT accepts ordinary
certificates as input and outputs newly generated certificates which could
trigger discrepancies with high efficiency. Benefited by the deep reinforcement
learning, when generating certificates, our framework could choose the best
next action according to the result of a previous modification, instead of
simple random combinations. At the same time, we developed a set of new
techniques to support the overall design, like new feature extraction method
for X.509 certificates, fine-grained differential testing, and so forth. Also,
we implemented a prototype of DRLGENCERT and carried out a series of real-world
experiments. The results show DRLGENCERT is quite efficient, and we obtained
84,661 discrepancy-triggering certificates from 181,900 certificate seeds, say
around 46.5% effectiveness. Also, we evaluated six popular SSL/TLS

1155,The Price of Political Uncertainty: Evidence from the 2016 U.S. Presidential Election and the U.S. Stock Markets,"There is bountiful evidence that political uncertainty stemming from
presidential elections or doubt about the direction of future policy make
financial markets significantly volatile, especially in proximity to close
elections or elections that may prompt radical policy changes. Although several
studies have examined the association between presidential elections and stock
returns, very little attention has been given to the impacts of elections and
election induced uncertainty on stock markets. This paper explores, at sectoral
level, the uncertain information hypothesis (UIH) as a means of explaining the
reaction of markets to the arrival of unanticipated information. This
hypothesis postulates that political uncertainty is greater prior to the
elections (relative to pre-election period) but is resolved once the outcome of
the elections is determined (relative to post-election period). To this end, we
adopt an event-study methodology that examines abnormal return behavior around
the election date. We show that collapsing stock returns around the election
result is reversed by positive abnormal return on the next day, except some
cases where we note negative responses following the vote count. Although
Trump's win plunges US into uncertain future, positive reactions of abnormal
return are found. Therefore, our results do not support the UIH hypothesis.
Besides, the effect of political uncertainty is sector-specific. While some
sectors emerged winners (healthcare, oil and gas, real estate, defense,
financials and consumer goods and services), others took the opposite route
(technology and utilities). The winning industries are generally those that
will benefit from the new administration's focus on rebuilding infrastructure,
renegotiating trade agreements, reforming tax policy and labour laws,
increasing defense funding, easing restrictions on energy production, and
rolling back Obamacare.",1612.06200v2,q-fin.GN,2016-12-19 14:28:59+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Jamal Bouoiyour'), arxiv.Result.Author('Refk Selmi')]",

node among trusted nodes, surrounded by Registration Authority nodes (RAs) in

from probable attackers and mitigate the authentication overhead. The RAs also
co-operate with member nodes to detect a target node and determine whether it

In addition, Internet Protocol (IP) based Triangulation and multi-lateration
method are deployed based on using the average time difference of Time of
Arrival (ToA) and Time of Departure (ToD) of the management packets.
Triangulation uses three reference nodes which are elected within each cluster
based on Best Criterion Function (BCF) to localize each member node inside the
cluster in 2D. Multi-lateration is employed to localize the malicious target
node in 2D using four neighbor nodes. After localization of two consecutive
positions, the target node is continuously localized and tracked by a
particular node using the modified real time Position Localization and Tracking
(PL&T) algorithm by adaptive beam forming and mapping the energy contours of

work investigates certified regression defenses, which provide guaranteed
limits on how much a regressor's prediction may change under a poisoning
attack. Our key insight is that certified regression reduces to voting-based
certified classification when using median as a model's primary decision
function. Coupling our reduction with existing certified classifiers, we
propose six new regressors provably-robust to poisoning attacks. To the extent
of our knowledge, this is the first work that certifies the robustness of
individual regression predictions without any assumptions about the data
distribution and model architecture. We also show that the assumptions made by
existing state-of-the-art certified classifiers are often overly pessimistic.
We introduce a tighter analysis of model robustness, which in many cases
results in significantly improved certified guarantees. Lastly, we empirically
demonstrate our approaches' effectiveness on both regression and classification
data, where the accuracy of up to 50% of test predictions can be guaranteed

  In this paper, we introduce the concept of certified domination that
perfectly models the aforementioned problem. Specifically, a dominating set $D$
of a graph $G=(V_G,E_G)$ is said to be certified if every vertex in $D$ has
either zero or at least two neighbours in $V_G\setminus D$. The cardinality of
a minimum certified dominating set in $G$ is called the certified domination
number of $G$. Herein, we present the exact values of the certified domination
number for some classes of graphs as well as provide some upper bounds on this
parameter for arbitrary graphs. We then characterise a wide class of graphs
with equal domination and certified domination numbers and characterise graphs
with large values of certified domination numbers. Next, we examine the effects
on the certified domination number when the graph is modified by
deleting/adding an edge or a vertex. We also provide Nordhaus-Gaddum type
inequalities for the certified domination number. Finally, we show that the
(decision) certified domination problem is NP-complete.",1606.03257v1,math.CO,2016-06-10 10:21:38+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Magda Dettlaff'), arxiv.Result.Author('Magdalena Lemańska'), arxiv.Result.Author('Jerzy Topp'), arxiv.Result.Author('Radosław Ziemann'), arxiv.Result.Author('Paweł Żyliński')]",

1164,Certified Robustness for Top-k Predictions against Adversarial Perturbations via Randomized Smoothing,"It is well-known that classifiers are vulnerable to adversarial
perturbations. To defend against adversarial perturbations, various certified
robustness results have been derived. However, existing certified robustnesses
are limited to top-1 predictions. In many real-world applications, top-$k$
predictions are more relevant. In this work, we aim to derive certified
robustness for top-$k$ predictions. In particular, our certified robustness is
based on randomized smoothing, which turns any classifier to a new classifier
via adding noise to an input example. We adopt randomized smoothing because it
is scalable to large-scale neural networks and applicable to any classifier. We
derive a tight robustness in $\ell_2$ norm for top-$k$ predictions when using
randomized smoothing with Gaussian noise. We find that generalizing the
certified robustness from top-1 to top-$k$ predictions faces significant
technical challenges. We also empirically evaluate our method on CIFAR10 and
ImageNet. For example, our method can obtain an ImageNet classifier with a
certified top-5 accuracy of 62.8\% when the $\ell_2$-norms of the adversarial
perturbations are less than 0.5 (=127/255). Our code is publicly available at:

method based on a new randomized smoothing technique, which constructs a
stochastic ensemble by applying random word substitutions on the input
sentences, and leverage the statistical properties of the ensemble to provably
certify the robustness. Our method is simple and structure-free in that it only
requires the black-box queries of the model outputs, and hence can be applied

inconsistent constraint of certified robustness between correctly classified

inconsistency caused by misclassified examples and add a novel consistency
regularization term to make better use of the misclassified examples.
Specifically, we identified that the certified robustness of network can be
significantly improved if the constraint of certified robustness on
misclassified examples and correctly classified examples is consistent.
Motivated by this discovery, we design a new defense regularization term called
Misclassification Aware Adversarial Regularization (MAAR), which constrains the

1168,On the Paradox of Certified Training,"Certified defenses based on convex relaxations are an established technique
for training provably robust models. The key component is the choice of
relaxation, varying from simple intervals to tight polyhedra.
Counterintuitively, loose interval-based training often leads to higher
certified robustness than what can be achieved with tighter relaxations, which
is a well-known but poorly understood paradox. While recent works introduced
various improvements aiming to circumvent this issue in practice, the
fundamental problem of training models with high certified robustness remains
unsolved. In this work, we investigate the underlying reasons behind the
paradox and identify two key properties of relaxations, beyond tightness, that
impact certified training dynamics: continuity and sensitivity. Our extensive
experimental evaluation with a number of popular convex relaxations provides
strong evidence that these factors can explain the drop in certified robustness
observed for tighter relaxations. We also systematically explore modifications
of existing relaxations and discover that improving unfavorable properties is
challenging, as such attempts often harm other properties, revealing a complex
tradeoff. Our findings represent an important first step towards understanding
the intricate optimization challenges involved in certified training.",2102.06700v3,cs.LG,2021-02-12 18:57:24+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Nikola Jovanović'), arxiv.Result.Author('Mislav Balunović'), arxiv.Result.Author('Maximilian Baader'), arxiv.Result.Author('Martin Vechev')]",

certified training is further hindered by the fact that periodic retraining is
necessary to incorporate new data and network improvements. In this paper, we
propose Certified Robustness Transfer (CRT), a general-purpose framework for
reducing the computational overhead of any certifiably robust training method

training loss to transfer the teacher's robustness to the student. We provide
theoretical and empirical validation of CRT. Our experiments on CIFAR-10 show

adversarial examples, which aim to mislead DNNs by adding perturbations with
small magnitude. To defend against such attacks, both empirical and theoretical
defense approaches have been extensively studied for a single ML model. In this
work, we aim to analyze and provide the certified robustness for ensemble ML
models, together with the sufficient and necessary conditions of robustness for
different ensemble protocols. Although ensemble models are shown more robust
than a single model empirically; surprisingly, we find that in terms of the
certified robustness the standard ensemble models only achieve marginal
improvement compared to a single model. Thus, to explore the conditions that
guarantee to provide certifiably robust ensemble ML models, we first prove that
diversified gradient and large confidence margin are sufficient and necessary
conditions for certifiably robust ensemble models under the model-smoothness
assumption. We then provide the bounded model-smoothness analysis based on the
proposed Ensemble-before-Smoothing strategy. We also prove that an ensemble
model can always achieve higher certified robustness than a single base model
under mild conditions. Inspired by the theoretical findings, we propose the
lightweight Diversity Regularized Training (DRT) to train certifiably robust

our work is that the adversarial patch intends to leverage localized
superficial important neurons (SIN) to manipulate the prediction results.
Hence, we leverage the SIN-based DNN compression techniques to significantly
improve the certified accuracy, by reducing the adversarial region searching
overhead and filtering the prediction noises. Our experimental results show

allocations of these tokens is often un-democratic, the DeFi project Yearn
Finance experimented with a fair launch allocation where no tokens are
pre-mined and all participants have an equal opportunity to receive them.
Regardless, research on voting rights tokens highlights the formation of

cause of concentration. To examine this proposition, this paper uses an

examine three distinct token allocation scenarios considered as fair. The
results show that regardless of the allocation, concentration persistently

1189,Distributed Monitoring of Election Winners,"We consider distributed elections, where there is a center and $k$ sites. In
such distributed elections, each voter has preferences over some set of
candidates, and each voter is assigned to exactly one site such that each site
is aware only of the voters assigned to it. The center is able to directly
communicate with all sites. We are interested in designing
communication-efficient protocols, allowing the center to maintain a candidate
which, with arbitrarily high probability, is guaranteed to be a winner, or at
least close to being a winner. We consider various single-winner voting rules,
such as variants of Approval voting and scoring rules, tournament-based voting
rules, and several round-based voting rules. For the voting rules we consider,
we show that, using communication which is logarithmic in the number of voters,
it is possible for the center to maintain such approximate winners; that is,
upon a query at any time the center can immediately return a candidate which is
guaranteed to be an approximate winner with high probability. We complement our
protocols with lower bounds. Our results are theoretical in nature and relate
to various scenarios, such as aggregating customer preferences in online
shopping websites or supermarket chains and collecting votes from different
polling stations of political elections.",1805.02206v2,cs.GT,2018-05-06 13:16:26+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Arnold Filtser'), arxiv.Result.Author('Nimrod Talmon')]",
1190,Design of Distributed Voting Systems,"Countries like Estonia, Norway or Australia developed electronic voting
systems, which could be used to realize parliamentary elections with the help
of personal computers and the Internet. These systems are completely different
in their design and their way to solve the same problem. In this thesis, we
analyze some of the largest real-world systems, describe their building blocks
and their general design to focus on possible problems in these electronic
voting systems.
  Furthermore, we present a template for an e-voting system, which we designed
to try to fulfill the preliminaries and requirements of a secure electronic
voting system. We use the experiences and the building blocks of existing
systems to combine them to another more secure system. Afterwards, we compare
our concept with real-world systems to evaluate the fulfillments of the
requirements. Conclusively, we discuss the occurring problems when designing a
secure system.
  Peer-to-peer networks provide many advantages, like decentralization, which
might be applicable to electronic voting systems. Therefore, we take a look on
the distributed database called blockchain and the usage in a peer-to-peer
voting system. Our contribution to this topic is a modification of the
proof-of-stake, which enables the usage of common devices, like smartphones or
tablets, for the blockchain verification and inclusion of new ballots to the
chain. This proof does not need much computing power and has a lower carbon
footprint than the proof-of-work in the Bitcoin protocol.",1702.02566v1,cs.CR,2017-02-08 10:17:01+00:00,[arxiv.Result.Author('Christian Meter')],

1192,Dissecting the Performance of Chained-BFT,"Permissioned blockchains employ Byzantine fault-tolerant (BFT) state machine
replication (SMR) to reach agreement on an ever-growing, linearly ordered log
of transactions. A new paradigm, combined with decades of research in BFT SMR
and blockchain (namely chained-BFT, or cBFT), has emerged for directly
constructing blockchain protocols. Chained-BFT protocols have a unifying
propose-vote scheme instead of multiple different voting phases with a set of
voting and commit rules to guarantee safety and liveness. However, distinct
voting and commit rules impose varying impacts on performance under different
workloads, network conditions, and Byzantine attacks. Therefore, a fair
comparison of the proposed protocols poses a challenge that has not yet been
addressed by existing work.
  We fill this gap by studying a family of cBFT protocols with a two-pronged
systematic approach. First, we present an evaluation framework, Bamboo, for
quick prototyping of cBFT protocols and that includes helpful benchmarking
facilities. To validate Bamboo, we introduce an analytic model using queuing
theory which also offers a back-of-the-envelope guide for dissecting these
protocols. We build multiple cBFT protocols using Bamboo and we are the first
to fairly compare three representatives (i.e., HotStuff, two-chain HotStuff,
and Streamlet). We evaluated these protocols under various parameters and
scenarios, including two Byzantine attacks that have not been widely discussed
in the literature. Our findings reveal interesting trade-offs (e.g.,
responsiveness vs. forking-resilience) between different cBFT protocols and
their design choices, which provide developers and researchers with insights
into the design and implementation of this protocol family.",2103.00777v1,cs.CR,2021-03-01 06:01:08+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Fangyu Gai'), arxiv.Result.Author('Ali Farahbakhsh'), arxiv.Result.Author('Jianyu Niu'), arxiv.Result.Author('Chen Feng'), arxiv.Result.Author('Ivan Beschastnikh'), arxiv.Result.Author('Hao Duan')]",
1193,A Novel Distance-Based Approach to Constrained Rank Aggregation,"We consider a classical problem in choice theory -- vote aggregation -- using
novel distance measures between permutations that arise in several practical
applications. The distance measures are derived through an axiomatic approach,
taking into account various issues arising in voting with side constraints. The
side constraints of interest include non-uniform relevance of the top and the
bottom of rankings (or equivalently, eliminating negative outliers in votes)
and similarities between candidates (or equivalently, introducing diversity in
the voting process). The proposed distance functions may be seen as weighted
versions of the Kendall $\tau$ distance and weighted versions of the Cayley
distance. In addition to proposing the distance measures and providing the
theoretical underpinnings for their applications, we also consider algorithmic
aspects associated with distance-based aggregation processes. We focus on two
methods. One method is based on approximating weighted distance measures by a
generalized version of Spearman's footrule distance, and it has provable
constant approximation guarantees. The second class of algorithms is based on a
non-uniform Markov chain method inspired by PageRank, for which currently only
heuristic guarantees are known. We illustrate the performance of the proposed
algorithms for a number of distance measures for which the optimal solution may
be easily computed.",1212.1471v1,cs.GT,2012-12-06 21:06:21+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Farzad Farnoud'), arxiv.Result.Author('Olgica Milenkovic'), arxiv.Result.Author('Behrouz Touri')]",

political space dimensionality and the identification of pivot legislators. The

agree surprisingly well with a simple model covering only equal voting
population-weighted distributions of precinct results containing no spatial
information. We find asymmetries where Democrats win fewer precincts than
Republicans but do so with large marjorities. This skew accounts for persistent
Republican control of State Legislatures and Congressional seats even in some
states with statewide vote majorities for Democrats.
  Despite overall results showing Republican advantages in many states based on
mean results from simulations covering many random scenarios, the simulations
yield a wide range in metrics, suggesting bias can be minimized better by
selecting districting plans with low values for efficiency gap than by
selecting plans with values near the means for the ensemble of random
simulations.
  We examine constraints on county splits to achieve higher compactness and
investigate policies requiring cohesiveness for communities of interest as to

1201,Towards Secure Virtual Elections: Multiparty Computation of Order Based Voting Rules,"Electronic voting systems are essential for holding virtual elections, and
the need for such systems increases due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the social
distancing that it mandates. One of the main challenges in e-voting systems is
to secure the voting process: namely, to certify that the computed results are
consistent with the cast ballots, and that the privacy of the voters is
preserved. We propose herein a secure voting protocol for elections that are
governed by order-based voting rules. Our protocol offers perfect ballot
secrecy, in the sense that it issues only the required output, while no other
information on the cast ballots is revealed. Such perfect secrecy, which is
achieved by employing secure multiparty computation tools, may increase the
voters' confidence and, consequently, encourage them to vote according to their
true preferences. Evaluation of the protocol's computational costs establishes
that it is lightweight and can be readily implemented in real-life electronic
elections.",2205.10580v3,cs.CR,2022-05-21 12:17:21+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Tamir Tassa'), arxiv.Result.Author('Lihi Dery')]",
1202,Limiting Risk by Turning Manifest Phantoms into Evil Zombies,"Drawing a random sample of ballots to conduct a risk-limiting audit generally
requires knowing how the ballots cast in an election are organized into groups,
for instance, how many containers of ballots there are in all and how many
ballots are in each container. A list of the ballot group identifiers along
with number of ballots in each group is called a ballot manifest. What if the
ballot manifest is not accurate? Surprisingly, even if ballots are known to be
missing from the manifest, it is not necessary to make worst-case assumptions
about those ballots--for instance, to adjust the margin by the number of
missing ballots--to ensure that the audit remains conservative. Rather, it
suffices to make worst-case assumptions about the individual randomly selected
ballots that the audit cannot find. This observation provides a simple
modification to some risk-limiting audit procedures that makes them
automatically become more conservative if the ballot manifest has errors. The
modification--phantoms to evil zombies (~2EZ)--requires only an upper bound on
the total number of ballots cast. ~2EZ makes the audit P-value stochastically
larger than it would be had the manifest been accurate, automatically requiring
more than enough ballots to be audited to offset the manifest errors. This
ensures that the true risk limit remains smaller than the nominal risk limit.
On the other hand, if the manifest is in fact accurate and the upper bound on
the total number of ballots equals the total according to the manifest, ~2EZ
has no effect at all on the number of ballots audited nor on the true risk
limit.",1207.3413v1,stat.AP,2012-07-14 11:26:02+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Jorge H. Banuelos'), arxiv.Result.Author('Philip B. Stark')]",

1204,Ballot-Polling Audits of Instant-Runoff Voting Elections with a Dirichlet-Tree Model,"Instant-runoff voting (IRV) is used in several countries around the world. It
requires voters to rank candidates in order of preference, and uses a counting
algorithm that is more complex than systems such as first-past-the-post or
scoring rules. An even more complex system, the single transferable vote (STV),
is used when multiple candidates need to be elected. The complexity of these
systems has made it difficult to audit the election outcomes. There is
currently no known risk-limiting audit (RLA) method for STV, other than a full
manual count of the ballots.
  A new approach to auditing these systems was recently proposed, based on a
Dirichlet-tree model. We present a detailed analysis of this approach for
ballot-polling Bayesian audits of IRV elections. We compared several choices
for the prior distribution, including some approaches using a Bayesian
bootstrap (equivalent to an improper prior). Our findings include that the
bootstrap-based approaches can be adapted to perform similarly to a full
Bayesian model in practice, and that an overly informative prior can give
counter-intuitive results. Via carefully chosen examples, we show why creating
an RLA with this model is challenging, but we also suggest ways to overcome
this.

In this study, we altered votes on a voter's ballot after they had made their
selections on a BMD. We then required them to examine their ballots for any
changes from the slate they used to vote. Overall accuracy was exceptionally
high. Participants saw 1440 total contests, and of those 1440, there were a
total of 4 errors, so total accuracy was 99.8%. Participants were able to
perform with near-perfect accuracy regardless of ballot length, ballot type,
number of altered races, and location of altered races. Detection performance
was extremely robust. We conclude that with proper direction and resources,
voters can be near-perfect detectors of ballot changes on printed paper ballots
after voting with a BMD. This finding has significant implications for the
voting community as BMD use continues to grow. Research should now focus on

determination of the inclination is very challenging for the common case of
slow rotators (like the Sun), making difficult the determination of a reliable
rotational splitting. Moreover, due to the numerous correlations, biases - more
or less significant - can appear in the determination of various parameters in
the case of bad inclination fittings, especially when a locking at 90 degrees

real ballots of any strict subset of districts at a price corresponding to the
willingness to sell on the part of the citizens holding such ballots. By
contrast, decoy voters are trapped into selling their ballots at a low, or even
negligible, price. Blowing up the adversary's budget by introducing decoy
ballots may thus turn out to be futile. The Devil's Menu can also be applied to

1211,The ATHENA Class of Risk-Limiting Ballot Polling Audits,"The main risk-limiting ballot polling audit in use today, BRAVO, is designed
for use when single ballots are drawn at random and a decision regarding
whether to stop the audit or draw another ballot is taken after each ballot
draw (ballot-by-ballot (B2) audits). On the other hand, real ballot polling
audits draw many ballots in a single round before determining whether to stop
(round-by-round (R2) audits). We show that BRAVO results in significant
inefficiency when directly applied to real R2 audits. We present the ATHENA
class of R2 stopping rules, which we show are risk-limiting if the round
schedule is pre-determined (before the audit begins). We prove that each rule
is at least as efficient as the corresponding BRAVO stopping rule applied at
the end of the round. We have open-source software libraries implementing most
of our results.
  We show that ATHENA halves the number of ballots required, for all state
margins in the 2016 US Presidential election and a first round with $90\%$
stopping probability, when compared to BRAVO (stopping rule applied at the end
of the round). We present simulation results supporting the 90% stopping
probability claims and our claims for the risk accrued in the first round.
Further, ATHENA reduces the number of ballots by more than a quarter for low
margins, when compared to the BRAVO stopping rule applied on ballots in
selection order. This implies that keeping track of the order when drawing
ballots R2 is not beneficial, because ATHENA is more efficient even without
information on selection order. These results are significant because current
approaches to real ballot polling election audits use the B2 BRAVO rules,
requiring about twice as much work on the part of election officials. Applying
the rules in selection order requires fewer ballots, but keeping track of the
order, and entering it into audit software, adds to the effort.",2008.02315v5,cs.CR,2020-08-05 18:47:37+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Filip Zagórski'), arxiv.Result.Author('Grant McClearn'), arxiv.Result.Author('Sarah Morin'), arxiv.Result.Author('Neal McBurnett'), arxiv.Result.Author('Poorvi L.

1212,$k$-Cut: A Simple Approximately-Uniform Method for Sampling Ballots in Post-Election Audits,"We present an approximate sampling framework and discuss how risk-limiting

""risk-limiting"" properties. Our framework is general and can compensate for
counting mistakes made during audits.
  Moreover, we present and analyze a simple approximate sampling
method,""$k$-cut"", for picking a ballot randomly from a stack, without counting.
Our method involves doing $k$ ""cuts"", each involving moving a random portion of
ballots from the top to the bottom of the stack, and then picking the ballot on
top. Unlike conventional methods of picking a ballot at random, $k$-cut does
not require identification numbers on the ballots or counting many ballots per
draw. We analyze how close the distribution of chosen ballots is to the uniform

of voters being unable to do so accurately or whether this is because voters
simply choose not to attempt verification in the first place. In order to
understand this problem, we conducted an experiment in which 108 participants
participated in a mock election where the BMD displayed the voters' true
choices, but then changed a subset of those choices on the printed ballot. The
design of the printed ballot, the length of the ballot, the number of changes
that were made to the ballot, the location of those changes, and the
instructions provided to the voters were manipulated as part of the experiment.
Results indicated that of those voters who chose to examine the printed ballot,
76% detected anomalies, indicating that voters can reliably detect errors on
their ballot if they will simply review it. This suggests that administrative

1221,Towards Secure Virtual Elections: Multiparty Computation of Order Based Voting Rules,"Electronic voting systems are essential for holding virtual elections, and
the need for such systems increases due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the social
distancing that it mandates. One of the main challenges in e-voting systems is
to secure the voting process: namely, to certify that the computed results are
consistent with the cast ballots, and that the privacy of the voters is
preserved. We propose herein a secure voting protocol for elections that are
governed by order-based voting rules. Our protocol offers perfect ballot
secrecy, in the sense that it issues only the required output, while no other
information on the cast ballots is revealed. Such perfect secrecy, which is
achieved by employing secure multiparty computation tools, may increase the
voters' confidence and, consequently, encourage them to vote according to their
true preferences. Evaluation of the protocol's computational costs establishes
that it is lightweight and can be readily implemented in real-life electronic
elections.",2205.10580v3,cs.CR,2022-05-21 12:17:21+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Tamir Tassa'), arxiv.Result.Author('Lihi Dery')]",
1222,Limiting Risk by Turning Manifest Phantoms into Evil Zombies,"Drawing a random sample of ballots to conduct a risk-limiting audit generally
requires knowing how the ballots cast in an election are organized into groups,
for instance, how many containers of ballots there are in all and how many
ballots are in each container. A list of the ballot group identifiers along
with number of ballots in each group is called a ballot manifest. What if the
ballot manifest is not accurate? Surprisingly, even if ballots are known to be
missing from the manifest, it is not necessary to make worst-case assumptions
about those ballots--for instance, to adjust the margin by the number of
missing ballots--to ensure that the audit remains conservative. Rather, it
suffices to make worst-case assumptions about the individual randomly selected
ballots that the audit cannot find. This observation provides a simple
modification to some risk-limiting audit procedures that makes them
automatically become more conservative if the ballot manifest has errors. The
modification--phantoms to evil zombies (~2EZ)--requires only an upper bound on
the total number of ballots cast. ~2EZ makes the audit P-value stochastically
larger than it would be had the manifest been accurate, automatically requiring
more than enough ballots to be audited to offset the manifest errors. This
ensures that the true risk limit remains smaller than the nominal risk limit.
On the other hand, if the manifest is in fact accurate and the upper bound on
the total number of ballots equals the total according to the manifest, ~2EZ
has no effect at all on the number of ballots audited nor on the true risk
limit.",1207.3413v1,stat.AP,2012-07-14 11:26:02+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Jorge H. Banuelos'), arxiv.Result.Author('Philip B. Stark')]",

1224,Ballot-Polling Audits of Instant-Runoff Voting Elections with a Dirichlet-Tree Model,"Instant-runoff voting (IRV) is used in several countries around the world. It
requires voters to rank candidates in order of preference, and uses a counting
algorithm that is more complex than systems such as first-past-the-post or
scoring rules. An even more complex system, the single transferable vote (STV),
is used when multiple candidates need to be elected. The complexity of these
systems has made it difficult to audit the election outcomes. There is
currently no known risk-limiting audit (RLA) method for STV, other than a full
manual count of the ballots.
  A new approach to auditing these systems was recently proposed, based on a
Dirichlet-tree model. We present a detailed analysis of this approach for
ballot-polling Bayesian audits of IRV elections. We compared several choices
for the prior distribution, including some approaches using a Bayesian
bootstrap (equivalent to an improper prior). Our findings include that the
bootstrap-based approaches can be adapted to perform similarly to a full
Bayesian model in practice, and that an overly informative prior can give
counter-intuitive results. Via carefully chosen examples, we show why creating
an RLA with this model is challenging, but we also suggest ways to overcome
this.
  As well as providing a practical and computationally feasible implementation
of a Bayesian IRV audit, our work is important in laying the foundation for an

In this study, we altered votes on a voter's ballot after they had made their
selections on a BMD. We then required them to examine their ballots for any
changes from the slate they used to vote. Overall accuracy was exceptionally
high. Participants saw 1440 total contests, and of those 1440, there were a
total of 4 errors, so total accuracy was 99.8%. Participants were able to
perform with near-perfect accuracy regardless of ballot length, ballot type,
number of altered races, and location of altered races. Detection performance
was extremely robust. We conclude that with proper direction and resources,
voters can be near-perfect detectors of ballot changes on printed paper ballots
after voting with a BMD. This finding has significant implications for the
voting community as BMD use continues to grow. Research should now focus on
identifying administrative and behavioral methods that will prompt and

for the errors of frequency, inclination and rotational splitting. The
determination of the inclination is very challenging for the common case of
slow rotators (like the Sun), making difficult the determination of a reliable
rotational splitting. Moreover, due to the numerous correlations, biases - more
or less significant - can appear in the determination of various parameters in
the case of bad inclination fittings, especially when a locking at 90 degrees
occurs. This issue concerning inclination locking is also discussed.

real ballots of any strict subset of districts at a price corresponding to the
willingness to sell on the part of the citizens holding such ballots. By
contrast, decoy voters are trapped into selling their ballots at a low, or even
negligible, price. Blowing up the adversary's budget by introducing decoy
ballots may thus turn out to be futile. The Devil's Menu can also be applied to

1231,The ATHENA Class of Risk-Limiting Ballot Polling Audits,"The main risk-limiting ballot polling audit in use today, BRAVO, is designed
for use when single ballots are drawn at random and a decision regarding
whether to stop the audit or draw another ballot is taken after each ballot
draw (ballot-by-ballot (B2) audits). On the other hand, real ballot polling
audits draw many ballots in a single round before determining whether to stop
(round-by-round (R2) audits). We show that BRAVO results in significant
inefficiency when directly applied to real R2 audits. We present the ATHENA
class of R2 stopping rules, which we show are risk-limiting if the round
schedule is pre-determined (before the audit begins). We prove that each rule
is at least as efficient as the corresponding BRAVO stopping rule applied at
the end of the round. We have open-source software libraries implementing most
of our results.
  We show that ATHENA halves the number of ballots required, for all state
margins in the 2016 US Presidential election and a first round with $90\%$
stopping probability, when compared to BRAVO (stopping rule applied at the end
of the round). We present simulation results supporting the 90% stopping
probability claims and our claims for the risk accrued in the first round.
Further, ATHENA reduces the number of ballots by more than a quarter for low
margins, when compared to the BRAVO stopping rule applied on ballots in
selection order. This implies that keeping track of the order when drawing
ballots R2 is not beneficial, because ATHENA is more efficient even without
information on selection order. These results are significant because current
approaches to real ballot polling election audits use the B2 BRAVO rules,
requiring about twice as much work on the part of election officials. Applying
the rules in selection order requires fewer ballots, but keeping track of the
order, and entering it into audit software, adds to the effort.",2008.02315v5,cs.CR,2020-08-05 18:47:37+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Filip Zagórski'), arxiv.Result.Author('Grant McClearn'), arxiv.Result.Author('Sarah Morin'), arxiv.Result.Author('Neal McBurnett'), arxiv.Result.Author('Poorvi L.

1236,"Voter Verification of BMD Ballots Is a Two-Part Question: Can They? Mostly, They Can. Do They? Mostly, They Don't","The question of whether or not voters actually verify ballots produced by
ballot marking devices (BMDs) is presently the subject of some controversy.
Recent studies (e.g., Bernhard, et al. 2020) suggest the verification rate is
low. What is not clear from previous research is whether this is more a result
of voters being unable to do so accurately or whether this is because voters
simply choose not to attempt verification in the first place. In order to
understand this problem, we conducted an experiment in which 108 participants
participated in a mock election where the BMD displayed the voters' true
choices, but then changed a subset of those choices on the printed ballot. The
design of the printed ballot, the length of the ballot, the number of changes
that were made to the ballot, the location of those changes, and the
instructions provided to the voters were manipulated as part of the experiment.
Results indicated that of those voters who chose to examine the printed ballot,
76% detected anomalies, indicating that voters can reliably detect errors on
their ballot if they will simply review it. This suggests that administrative
remedies, rather than attempts to alter fundamental human perceptual
capabilities, could be employed to encourage voters to check their ballots,
which could prove as an effective countermeasure.",2003.04997v1,cs.HC,2020-03-10 21:06:42+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Philip Kortum'), arxiv.Result.Author('Michael D. Byrne'), arxiv.Result.Author('Julie Whitmore')]",

  Colorado's current audit software (RLATool) needs to be improved to audit

  This paper addresses these needs. It presents extremely simple but

ballot-level comparison and variable-size batch comparison audits in a way that
does not require stratified sampling.

incorrect election results, independent of why the result was incorrect.
Ballot-polling audits select ballots at random and interpret those ballots as
evidence for and against the reported result, continuing this process until
either they support the recorded result, or they fall back to a full manual
recount. For elections with digitised scanning and counting of ballots, a
comparison audit compares randomly selected digital ballots with their paper
versions. Discrepancies are referred to as errors, and are used to build
evidence against or in support of the recorded result. Risk-limiting audits for
first-past-the-post elections are well understood, and used in some US
elections. We define a number of approaches to ballot-polling and comparison
risk-limiting audits for Instant Runoff Voting (IRV) elections. We show that
for almost all real elections we found, we can perform a risk-limiting audit by
looking at only a small fraction of the total ballots (assuming no errors were
made in the tallying and distribution of votes).",1903.08804v2,cs.DS,2019-03-20 06:19:10+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Michelle Blom'), arxiv.Result.Author('Peter J. Stuckey'), arxiv.Result.Author('Vanessa Teague')]",

1240,TRIP: Trustless Coercion-Resistant In-Person Voter Registration,"Most existing remote electronic voting systems are vulnerable to voter
coercion and vote buying. While coercion-resistant voting systems address this
challenge, current schemes assume that the voter has access to an untappable,
incorruptible device during voter registration. We present TRIP, an in-person
voter registration scheme enabling voters to create verifiable and
indistinguishable real and fake credentials using an untrusted kiosk inside a
privacy booth at a supervised location, e.g., the registrar's office. TRIP
ensures the integrity of the voter's real credential while enabling the
creation of fake credentials using interactive zero-knowledge proofs between
the voter as the verifier and the kiosk as the prover, unbeknownst to the
average voter. TRIP ensures that even voters who are under extreme coercion,
and cannot leave the booth with a real credential, can delegate their vote to a
political party, with the caveat that they must then trust the kiosk. TRIP
optimizes the tallying process by limiting the number of credentials a voter
can receive and capping the number of votes that a credential can cast per
election. We conduct a preliminary usability study among 41 participants at a
university and found that 42.5% of participants rated TRIP a B or higher in
usability, a promising result for a voter registration scheme that
substantially reduces trust in the registrar.",2202.06692v1,cs.CR,2022-02-14 13:35:46+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Louis-Henri Merino'), arxiv.Result.Author('Simone Colombo'), arxiv.Result.Author('Jeff Allen'), arxiv.Result.Author('Vero Estrada-Galiñanes'), arxiv.Result.Author('Bryan Ford')]",
1241,"Polling bias and undecided voter allocations: US Presidential elections, 2004 - 2016","Accounting for undecided and uncertain voters is a challenging issue for
predicting election results from public opinion polls. Undecided voters typify
the uncertainty of swing voters in polls but are often ignored or allocated to
each candidate in a simple, deterministic manner. Historically this may have
been adequate because the undecided were comparatively small enough to assume
that they do not affect the relative proportions of the decided voters.
However, in the presence of high numbers of undecided voters, these static
rules may in fact bias election predictions from election poll authors and
meta-poll analysts. In this paper, we examine the effect of undecided voters in
the 2016 US presidential election to the previous three presidential elections.
We show there were a relatively high number of undecided voters over the
campaign and on election day, and that the allocation of undecided voters in
this election was not consistent with two-party proportional (or even)
allocations. We find evidence that static allocation regimes are inadequate for
election prediction models and that probabilistic allocations may be superior.

1243,An adaptive voter model on simplicial complexes,"Collective decision making processes lie at the heart of many social,
political and economic challenges. The classical voter model is a
well-established conceptual model to study such processes. In this work, we
define a new form of adaptive (or co-evolutionary) voter model posed on a
simplicial complex, i.e., on a certain class of hypernetworks/hypergraphs. We
use the persuasion rule along edges of the classical voter model and the
recently studied re-wiring rule of edges towards like-minded nodes, and
introduce a new peer pressure rule applied to three nodes connected via a
2-simplex. This simplicial adaptive voter model is studied via numerical
simulation. We show that adding the effect of peer pressure to an adaptive
voter model leaves its fragmentation transition, i.e., the transition upon
varying the re-wiring rate from a single majority state into to a fragmented
state of two different opinion subgraphs, intact. Yet, above and below the
fragmentation transition, we observe that the peer pressure has substantial
quantitative effects. It accelerates the transition to a single-opinion state
below the transition and also speeds up the system dynamics towards
fragmentation above the transition. Furthermore, we quantify that there is a
multiscale hierarchy in the model leading to the depletion of 2-simplices,
before the depletion of active edges. This leads to the conjecture that many
other dynamic network models on simplicial complexes may show a similar
behaviour with respect to the sequential evolution of simplicies of different
dimensions.",1909.05812v1,nlin.AO,2019-09-12 17:13:22+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Leonhard Horstmeyer'), arxiv.Result.Author('Christian Kuehn')]","Phys. Rev. E 101, 022305 (2020)"

ensure a robust democracy. Secure electronic voting is a vision for the future
of elections and referendums. Such a system can counteract factors that hinder
strong voter turnout such as the requirement of physical presence during
limited hours at polling stations. However, this vision brings transparency and
confidentiality requirements that render the design of such solutions
challenging. Specifically, the counting must be implemented in a reproducible
way and the ballots of individual voters must remain concealed. In this paper,
we propose and evaluate a referendum protocol that ensures transparency,
confidentiality, and integrity, in trustless networks. The protocol is built by
combining Secure Multi-Party Computation (SMPC) and Distributed Ledger or
Blockchain technology. The persistence and immutability of the protocol
communication allows verifiability of the referendum outcome on the client

1245,Enhancing Engagement in Token-Curated Registries via an Inflationary Mechanism,"Token Curated Registries (TCR) are decentralized recommendation systems that
can be implemented using Blockchain smart contracts. They allow participants to
vote for or against adding items to a list through a process that involves
staking tokens intrinsic to the registry, with winners receiving the staked
tokens for each vote. A TCR aims to provide incentives to create a well-curated
list. In this work, we consider a challenge for these systems - incentivizing
token-holders to actually engage and participate in the voting process. We
propose a novel token-inflation mechanism for enhancing engagement, whereby
only voting participants see their token supply increased by a pre-defined
multiple after each round of voting. To evaluate this proposal, we propose a
simple 4-class model of voters that captures all possible combinations of two
key dimensions: whether they are engaged (likely to vote at all for a given
item) or disengaged, and whether they are informed (likely to vote in a way
that increases the quality of the list) or uninformed, and a simple metric to
evaluate the quality of the list as a function of the vote outcomes. We conduct
simulations using this model of voters and show that implementing
token-inflation results in greater wealth accumulation for engaged voters. In
particular, when the number of informed voters is sufficiently high, our
simulations show that voters that are both informed and engaged see the
greatest benefits from participating in the registry when our proposed
token-inflation mechanism is employed. We further validate this finding using a
simplified mathematical analysis.",1811.09680v1,cs.GT,2018-11-23 20:51:13+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Yi Lucy Wang'), arxiv.Result.Author('Bhaskar Krishnamachari')]",

explores how South African can leverage the opportunities that e-voting

real-valued functions seen as voters, leading to the lowest misclassification
rate, while maximizing the voters' diversity. We propose an extension of MinCq

pairwise loss adapted to ranking that allows us to improve Mean Averaged

such a context, the voting can only be sparse, as the number of alternatives is

Moreover, in critical applications, malicious players might seek to hack the
voting process by entering dishonest reviews or creating fake accounts.
Classical voting methods are unfit for this task, as they usually (a) require
each reviewer to assess all available alternatives and (b) can be easily
manipulated by malicious players.
  This paper defines precisely the problem of robust sparse voting, highlights
its underlying technical challenges, and presents Mehestan, a novel voting
mechanism that solves the problem. Namely, we prove that by using Mehestan, no
(malicious) voter can have more than a small parametrizable effect on each
alternative's score, and we identify conditions of voters comparability under

swapping the positions of two consecutive candidates in their preference order,
and for perturbing their approval count to favour candidates.

that linking voter roll data -- containing individual-level voter turnout for
specific voting locations along with race and age -- can facilitate the
construction of rigorous bias and reliability tests. These tests illuminate a
sampling bias that is particularly noteworthy in the pandemic context: older

1254,Towards end-to-end verifiable online voting: adding verifiability to established voting systems,"Online voting for independent elections is generally supported by trusted
election providers. Typically these providers do not offer any way in which a
voter can verify their vote, so the providers are trusted with ballot privacy
and ensuring correctness. Despite the desire to offer online voting for
political elections, this lack of transparency and verifiability is often seen
as a significant barrier to the large-scale adoption of online elections.
Adding verifiability to an online election increases transparency and
integrity, allowing voters to verify that their vote has been recorded
correctly and included in the tally. However, replacing existing online systems
with those that provide verifiable voting requires new algorithms and code to
be deployed, and this presents a significant business risk to commercial
election providers. In this paper we present the first step in an incremental
approach which minimises the business risk but demonstrates the advantages of
verifiability, by developing an implementation of key elements of a
Selene-based verifiability layer and adding it to an operational online voting
system. Selene is a verifiable voting protocol that uses trackers to enable
voters to confirm that their votes have been captured correctly while
protecting voter anonymity. This results in a system where even the election
authority running the system cannot change the result in an undetectable way,
and gives stronger guarantees on the integrity of the election than were
previously present. We explore the challenges presented by adding a
verifiability layer to an operational system. We describe the results of two
initial trials, which obtained that survey respondents found this form of
verifiability easy to use and that they broadly appreciated it. We conclude by
outlining the further steps in the road-map towards the deployment of a fully

give better results in comparison to single identification based systems.
Finger print and facial recognition based methods are used for voter
identification. Cross verification of a voter during an election process
provides better accuracy than single parameter identification method. The
facial recognition system uses Viola-Jones algorithm along with rectangular
Haar feature selection method for detection and extraction of features to
develop a biometric template and for feature extraction during the voting
process. Cascaded machine learning based classifiers are used for comparing the
features for identity verification using GPCA (Generalized Principle Component
Analysis) and K-NN (K-Nearest Neighbor). It is accomplished through comparing
the Eigen-vectors of the extracted features with the biometric template
pre-stored in the election regulatory body database. The results of the
proposed system show that the proposed cascaded design based system performs
better than the systems using other classifiers or separate schemes i.e. facial
or finger print based schemes. The proposed system will be highly useful for
real time applications due to the reason that it has 91% accuracy under nominal
light in terms of facial recognition. with bags of paper votes. The central

and candidate choice. While contemporary work on the distribution of political
opinion has emphasized polarization and an increasing gap between the ""left""

anti-polarization: competing candidates move to the center of the ideological
distribution to maximize vote share, regardless of the underlying ideological
distribution of voters. These anti-polar results, however, largely depend on
the ""singled-peakedness"" of voter preferences, an assumption that is rapidly
loosing relevance in the age of polarization. This article presents a model of
voter choice that examines three potential mechanisms that can undermine this
finding: a relative cost of voting that deters voters who are sufficiently
indifferent to both candidates, ideologically motivated third-party
alternatives that attract extreme voters, and a bimodal distribution of voter
ideology. Under reasonable sets of conditions and empirically observed voter
opinion distributions, these mechanisms can be sufficient to cause
strategically-minded candidates to fail to converge to the center, or to even

1258,On the Optimal Design of Triple Modular Redundancy Logic for SRAM-based FPGAs,"Triple Modular Redundancy (TMR) is a suitable fault tolerant technique for
SRAM-based FPGA. However, one of the main challenges in achieving 100%
robustness in designs protected by TMR running on programmable platforms is to
prevent upsets in the routing from provoking undesirable connections between
signals from distinct redundant logic parts, which can generate an error in the
output. This paper investigates the optimal design of the TMR logic (e.g., by
cleverly inserting voters) to ensure robustness. Four different versions of a
TMR digital filter were analyzed by fault injection. Faults were randomly
inserted straight into the bitstream of the FPGA. The experimental results
presented in this paper demonstrate that the number and placement of voters in
the TMR design can directly affect the fault tolerance, ranging from 4.03% to
0.98% the number of upsets in the routing able to cause an error in the TMR
circuit.",0710.4688v1,cs.AR,2007-10-25 09:09:34+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('F. Lima Kastensmidt'), arxiv.Result.Author('L. Sterpone'), arxiv.Result.Author('L. Carro'), arxiv.Result.Author('M. Sonza Reorda')]","Dans Design, Automation and Test in Europe - DATE'05, Munich :

1259,Voter models on weighted networks,"We study the dynamics of the voter and Moran processes running on top of
complex network substrates where each edge has a weight depending on the degree
of the nodes it connects. For each elementary dynamical step the first node is
chosen at random and the second is selected with probability proportional to
the weight of the connecting edge. We present a heterogeneous mean-field
approach allowing to identify conservation laws and to calculate exit
probabilities along with consensus times. In the specific case when the weight
is given by the product of nodes' degree raised to a power theta, we derive a
rich phase-diagram, with the consensus time exhibiting various scaling laws
depending on theta and on the exponent of the degree distribution gamma.
Numerical simulations give very good agreement for small values of |theta|. An
additional analytical treatment (heterogeneous pair approximation) improves the
agreement with numerics, but the theoretical understanding of the behavior in
the limit of large |theta| remains an open challenge.",1011.2395v2,cond-mat.stat-mech,2010-11-10 14:54:27+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Andrea Baronchelli'), arxiv.Result.Author('Claudio Castellano'), arxiv.Result.Author('Romualdo Pastor-Satorras')]","Phys. Rev. E 83, 066117 (2011)"

1261,A Framework for Challenge Design: Insight and Deployment Challenges to Address Medical Image Analysis Problems,"In this paper we aim to refine the concept of grand challenges in medical
image analysis, based on statistical principles from quantitative and
qualitative experimental research. We identify two types of challenges based on
their generalization objective: 1) a deployment challenge and 2) an insight
challenge. A deployment challenge's generalization objective is to find
algorithms that solve a medical image analysis problem, which thereby requires
the use of a quantitative experimental design. An insight challenge's
generalization objective is to gain a broad understanding of what class of
algorithms might be effective for a class of medical image analysis problems,
in which case a qualitative experimental design is sufficient. Both challenge
types are valuable, but problems arise when a challenge's design and objective
are inconsistent, as is often the case when a challenge does not carefully
consider these concepts. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a theoretical
framework, based on statistical principles, to guide researchers in challenge
design, documentation, and assessment. Experimental results are given that
explore the factors that effect the practical implementation of this
theoretical framework.",1911.08531v1,stat.AP,2019-11-19 19:49:39+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Adriënne M. Mendrik'), arxiv.Result.Author('Stephen R. Aylward')]",

1263,Will You Dance To The Challenge? Predicting User Participation of TikTok Challenges,"TikTok is a popular new social media, where users express themselves through
short video clips. A common form of interaction on the platform is
participating in ""challenges"", which are songs and dances for users to iterate
upon. Challenge contagion can be measured through replication reach, i.e.,
users uploading videos of their participation in the challenges. The uniqueness
of the TikTok platform where both challenge content and user preferences are
evolving requires the combination of challenge and user representation. This
paper investigates social contagion of TikTok challenges through predicting a
user's participation. We propose a novel deep learning model, deepChallenger,
to learn and combine latent user and challenge representations from past videos
to perform this user-challenge prediction task. We collect a dataset of over
7,000 videos from 12 trending challenges on the ForYouPage, the app's landing

advance by humans and limited in number. Alternatively, some games incorporate
rules for stochastic setup, where the human solver randomly sets up the game
board before solving the challenge. These setup rules greatly increase the
number of possible challenges, but can often generate unsolvable or
uninteresting challenges. To better understand the compromises involved in
minimizing undesirable challenges, we examine three games where component
design choices can influence the stochastic nature of the resulting challenge
generation algorithms. We evaluate the effect of these components and
algorithms on challenge solvability and challenge engagement. We find that
algorithms which control randomness through entangling components based on
sub-elements of the puzzle mechanics can generate interesting challenges with a
high probability of being solvable.",1810.01926v3,cs.AI,2018-10-03 19:35:44+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Mark Goadrich'), arxiv.Result.Author('James Droscha')]",

1266,Beyond the Leaderboard: Insight and Deployment Challenges to Address Research Problems,"In the medical image analysis field, organizing challenges with associated
workshops at international conferences began in 2007 and has grown to include
over 150 challenges. Several of these challenges have had a major impact in the
field. However, whereas well-designed challenges have the potential to unite
and focus the field on creating solutions to important problems, poorly
designed and documented challenges can equally impede a field and lead to
pursuing incremental improvements in metric scores with no theoretic or
clinical significance. This is supported by a critical assessment of challenges
at the international MICCAI conference. In this assessment the main observation
was that small changes to the underlying challenge data can drastically change
the ranking order on the leaderboard. Related to this is the practice of
leaderboard climbing, which is characterized by participants focusing on
incrementally improving metric results rather than advancing science or solving
the driving problem of a challenge. In this abstract we look beyond the
leaderboard of a challenge and instead look at the conclusions that can be
drawn from a challenge with respect to the research problem that it is
addressing. Research study design is well described in other research areas and
can be translated to challenge design when viewing challenges as research
studies on algorithm performance that address a research problem. Based on the
two main types of scientific research study design, we propose two main
challenge types, which we think would benefit other research areas as well: 1)
an insight challenge that is based on a qualitative study design and 2) a
deployment challenge that is based on a quantitative study design. In addition
we briefly touch upon related considerations with respect to statistical
significance versus practical significance, generalizability and data

frequently different than those studied in the mindset literature. We show
that, in the landscape of college physics challenges, mindset beliefs cannot

1291,CHARTER: Identifying the Most-Critical Gate Operations in Quantum Circuits via Amplified Gate Reversibility,"When quantum programs are executed on noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ)
computers, they experience hardware noise; consequently, the program outputs
are often erroneous. To mitigate the adverse effects of hardware noise, it is
necessary to understand the effect of hardware noise on the program output and
more fundamentally, understand the impact of hardware noise on specific regions
within a quantum program. Identifying and optimizing regions that are more
noise-sensitive is the key to expanding the capabilities of NISQ computers.
  Toward achieving that goal, we propose CHARTER, a novel technique to pinpoint
specific gates and regions within a quantum program that are the most affected
by the hardware noise and that have the highest impact on the program output.
Using CHARTER's methodology, programmers can obtain a precise understanding of
how different components of their code affect the output and optimize those
components without the need for non-scalable quantum simulation on classical
computers.",2211.09903v1,quant-ph,2022-11-17 21:34:32+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Tirthak Patel'), arxiv.Result.Author('Daniel Silver'), arxiv.Result.Author('Devesh Tiwari')]","SC22: International Conference for High Performance Computing,

1294,Identifying Possible Winners in Ranked Choice Voting Elections with Outstanding Ballots,"Several election districts in the US have recently moved to ranked-choice
voting (RCV) to decide the results of local elections. RCV allows voters to
rank their choices, and the results are computed in rounds, eliminating one
candidate at a time. RCV ensures fairer elections and has been shown to
increase elected representation of women and people of color. A main drawback
of RCV is that the round-by-round process requires all the ballots to be
tallied before the results of an election can be calculated. With increasingly
large portions of ballots coming from absentee voters, RCV election outcomes
are not always apparent on election night, and can take several weeks to be
published, leading to a loss of trust in the electoral process from the public.
In this paper, we present an algorithm for efficiently computing possible
winners of RCV elections from partially known ballots and evaluate it on data
from the recent New York City Primary elections. We show that our techniques
allow to significantly narrow down the field of possible election winners, and
in some case identify the winner as soon as election night despite a number of

1299,The Price of Political Uncertainty: Evidence from the 2016 U.S. Presidential Election and the U.S. Stock Markets,"There is bountiful evidence that political uncertainty stemming from
presidential elections or doubt about the direction of future policy make
financial markets significantly volatile, especially in proximity to close
elections or elections that may prompt radical policy changes. Although several
studies have examined the association between presidential elections and stock
returns, very little attention has been given to the impacts of elections and
election induced uncertainty on stock markets. This paper explores, at sectoral
level, the uncertain information hypothesis (UIH) as a means of explaining the
reaction of markets to the arrival of unanticipated information. This
hypothesis postulates that political uncertainty is greater prior to the
elections (relative to pre-election period) but is resolved once the outcome of
the elections is determined (relative to post-election period). To this end, we
adopt an event-study methodology that examines abnormal return behavior around
the election date. We show that collapsing stock returns around the election
result is reversed by positive abnormal return on the next day, except some
cases where we note negative responses following the vote count. Although
Trump's win plunges US into uncertain future, positive reactions of abnormal
return are found. Therefore, our results do not support the UIH hypothesis.
Besides, the effect of political uncertainty is sector-specific. While some
sectors emerged winners (healthcare, oil and gas, real estate, defense,
financials and consumer goods and services), others took the opposite route
(technology and utilities). The winning industries are generally those that
will benefit from the new administration's focus on rebuilding infrastructure,
renegotiating trade agreements, reforming tax policy and labour laws,
increasing defense funding, easing restrictions on energy production, and
rolling back Obamacare.",1612.06200v2,q-fin.GN,2016-12-19 14:28:59+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Jamal Bouoiyour'), arxiv.Result.Author('Refk Selmi')]",

detection is a critical component of fact checking systems. There are multiple
lines of research which study this problem: check-worthiness ranking from
political speeches and debates, rumour detection on Twitter, and citation
needed detection from Wikipedia. To date, there has been no structured
comparison of these various tasks to understand their relatedness, and no
investigation into whether or not a unified approach to all of them is
achievable. In this work, we illuminate a central challenge in claim
check-worthiness detection underlying all of these tasks, being that they hinge
upon detecting both how factual a sentence is, as well as how likely a sentence
is to be believed without verification. As such, annotators only mark those
instances they judge to be clear-cut check-worthy. Our best performing method
is a unified approach which automatically corrects for this using a variant of
positive unlabelled learning that finds instances which were incorrectly

joint nonparametric mixture, and provide guidelines for straightforward
application of these techniques. A key feature of such models is that they can
yield flexible inference about the conditional distribution for multivariate
marks without requiring specification of a complicated dependence scheme. We
address issues relating to choice of the Dirichlet process mixture kernels, and
develop methods for prior specification and posterior simulation for full
inference about functionals of the marked Poisson process. Moreover, we discuss
a method for model checking that can be used to assess and compare goodness of
fit of different model specifications under the proposed framework. The

1305,Checking marking reachability with the state equation in Petri net subclasses,"Although decidable, the marking reachability problem for Petri nets is
well-known to be intractable in general, and a non-elementary lower bound has
been recently uncovered. In order to alleviate this difficulty, various
structural and behavioral restrictions have been considered, allowing to relate
reachability to properties that are easier to check. For a given initial
marking, the set of potentially reachable markings is described by the state
equation solutions and over-approximates the set of reachable markings.
  In this paper, we delineate several subclasses of weighted Petri nets in
which the set of reachable markings equals the set of potentially reachable
ones, a property we call the PR-R equality. When fulfilled, this property
allows to use linear algebra to answer the reachability questions, avoiding a
brute-force analysis of the state space. Notably, we provide conditions under
which this equality holds in classes much more expressive than marked graphs,
adding places with several ingoing and outgoing transitions, which allows to
model real applications with shared buffers. To achieve it, we investigate the
relationship between liveness, reversibility, boundedness and potential
reachability in Petri nets. We also show that this equality does not hold in

moderate and large code lengths. To overcome this problem, Vontobel et al.
developed an iterative Low-Complexity LP (LCLP) decoding algorithm for binary
LDPC codes. The variable and check node calculations of binary LCLP decoding
algorithm are related to those of binary Belief Propagation (BP). The present
authors generalized this work to derive an iterative LCLP decoding algorithm
for nonbinary linear codes. Contrary to binary LCLP, the variable and check
node calculations of this algorithm are in general different from that of
nonbinary BP. The overall complexity of nonbinary LCLP decoding is linear in
block length; however the complexity of its check node calculations is
exponential in the check node degree. In this paper, we propose a modified BCJR
algorithm for efficient check node processing in the nonbinary LCLP decoding
algorithm. The proposed algorithm has complexity linear in the check node
degree. We also introduce an alternative state metric to improve the run time

accumulates in reverse order a list of new vertices. In the second stage, the
$n$-th bisection, the method uses the reversed list to cast the bisected
simplices as reflected simplices, a simplex type suitable for newest vertex
bisection. In the final stage, beyond the $n$-th bisection, the method switches
to newest vertex bisection. To allow this switch, after the second stage, we
check that under uniform bisection the mesh simplices are conformal and
reflected. These conditions are sufficient to use newest vertex bisection, a
bisection scheme guaranteeing key advantages for local refinement. Finally, the
results show that the proposed bisection is well-suited for local refinement of

arithmetic such that: $\varphi(\vec{m}_\text{src})$ holds; $\varphi$ is forward
invariant, i.e., $\varphi(\vec{m})$ and $\vec{m} \rightarrow \vec{m}'$ imply
$\varphi(\vec{m}'$); and $\neg \varphi(\vec{m}_\text{tgt})$ holds. While these
separators could be used as explanations and as formal certificates of
unreachability, this has not yet been the case due to their
(super-)Ackermannian worst-case size and the (super-)exponential complexity of
checking that a formula is a separator.
  We show that, in continuous Petri nets, these two problems can be overcome.
We introduce locally closed separators, and prove that: (a) unreachability can
be witnessed by a locally closed separator computable in polynomial time; (b)
checking whether a formula is a locally closed separator is in NC (so, simpler
than unreachablity, which is P-complete).

Zenoness: whether there exists a zeno-computation from a given marking, i.e.,
an infinite computation which takes only a finite amount of time. We show
decidability of zenoness for TPNs, thus solving an open problem from [Escrig et
al.]. Furthermore, the related question if there exist arbitrarily fast
computations from a given marking is also decidable. On the other hand,
universal zenoness, i.e., the question if all infinite computations from a
given marking are zeno, is undecidable. (ii) Token liveness: whether a token is
alive in a marking, i.e., whether there is a computation from the marking which
eventually consumes the token. We show decidability of the problem by reducing
it to the coverability problem, which is decidable for TPNs. (iii) Boundedness:
whether the size of the reachable markings is bounded. We consider two versions
of the problem; namely semantic boundedness where only live tokens are taken
into consideration in the markings, and syntactic boundedness where also dead
tokens are considered. We show undecidability of semantic boundedness, while we

1320,Influence of collaborative customer service by service robots and clerks in bakery stores,"In recent years, various service robots have been introduced in stores as
recommendation systems. Previous studies attempted to increase the influence of
these robots by improving their social acceptance and trust. However, when such
service robots recommend a product to customers in real environments, the
effect on the customers is influenced not only by the robot itself, but also by
the social influence of the surrounding people such as store clerks. Therefore,
leveraging the social influence of the clerks may increase the influence of the
robots on the customers. Hence, we compared the influence of robots with and
without collaborative customer service between the robots and clerks in two
bakery stores. The experimental results showed that collaborative customer
service increased the purchase rate of the recommended bread and improved the
impression regarding the robot and store experience of the customers. Because
the results also showed that the workload required for the clerks to
collaborate with the robot was not high, this study suggests that all stores
with service robots may show high effectiveness in introducing collaborative
customer service.",2212.10687v1,cs.RO,2022-12-20 23:08:43+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Yuki Okafuji'), arxiv.Result.Author('Sichao Song'), arxiv.Result.Author('Jun Baba'), arxiv.Result.Author('Yuichiro Yoshikawa'), arxiv.Result.Author('Hiroshi Ishiguro')]",
1321,Shuffled Check-in: Privacy Amplification towards Practical Distributed Learning,"Recent studies of distributed computation with formal privacy guarantees,
such as differentially private (DP) federated learning, leverage random
sampling of clients in each round (privacy amplification by subsampling) to
achieve satisfactory levels of privacy. Achieving this however requires strong
assumptions which may not hold in practice, including precise and uniform
subsampling of clients, and a highly trusted aggregator to process clients'
data. In this paper, we explore a more practical protocol, shuffled check-in,
to resolve the aforementioned issues. The protocol relies on client making
independent and random decision to participate in the computation, freeing the
requirement of server-initiated subsampling, and enabling robust modelling of
client dropouts. Moreover, a weaker trust model known as the shuffle model is
employed instead of using a trusted aggregator. To this end, we introduce new
tools to characterize the R\'enyi differential privacy (RDP) of shuffled
check-in. We show that our new techniques improve at least three times in
privacy guarantee over those using approximate DP's strong composition at
various parameter regimes. Furthermore, we provide a numerical approach to
track the privacy of generic shuffled check-in mechanism including distributed
stochastic gradient descent (SGD) with Gaussian mechanism. To the best of our
knowledge, this is also the first evaluation of Gaussian mechanism within the
local/shuffle model under the distributed setting in the literature, which can
be of independent interest.",2206.03151v1,cs.LG,2022-06-07 09:55:15+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Seng Pei Liew'), arxiv.Result.Author('Satoshi Hasegawa'), arxiv.Result.Author('Tsubasa Takahashi')]",

each box, and thereby, vertices in preassigned boxes can divide subsequent
boxes into more than one pieces, but divided boxes are counted once. We find
that such box-split allowance in the algorithm is a crucial ingredient
necessary to obtain the fractal scaling for fractal networks; however, it is
inessential for regular lattice and conventional fractal objects embedded in
the Euclidean space. Next the algorithm is viewed from the cluster-growing
perspective that boxes are allowed to overlap and thereby, vertices can belong
to more than one box. Then, the number of distinct boxes a vertex belongs to is
distributed in a heterogeneous manner for SF fractal networks, while it is of
Poisson-type for the conventional fractal objects.",cond-mat/0701504v1,cond-mat.stat-mech,2007-01-21 12:28:59+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('J. S. Kim'), arxiv.Result.Author('K. -I. Goh'), arxiv.Result.Author('B. Kahng'), arxiv.Result.Author('D. Kim')]","Chaos 17, 026116 (2007)"

swapping of two multipartite boxes, and then generate a multipartite box with
more users than that of any of the boxes before swapping. Here quantum bound
still appears in the scheme. The bipartite coupler also can be applied to a
hybrid scheme of generating a multipartite extremal box from many PR boxes. As
the analogue of multipartite entanglement swapping, we generalize the
nonlocality swapping of bipartite binary boxes to multipartite binary boxes by
using a multipartite coupler $\chi_{N}$, and get the probability of success by
connecting the coupler to the generalized Svetlichny inequality. The
multipartite coupler acting on many multipartite boxes makes multipartite
nonlocality swapping be a more efficient device to manipulate nonlocality
between many users. The results show that Tsirelson's bound for quantum
nonlocality emerges only when two of the $n$ boxes involved in the coupler

with one bit of communication offers RAC. As said, PR-box can simulate racbox.
The question we raise, is whether any racbox can simulate PR-box. We show that
a non-signaling racbox indeed can simulate PR-box, hence those two resources

train an agent to automatically choose a sequence of actions for a human
annotator to produce a bounding box in a minimal amount of time. Specifically,

generated by an object detector, and manual box drawing. We explore two kinds
of agents, one based on predicting the probability that a box will be
positively verified, and the other based on reinforcement learning. We
demonstrate that (1) our agents are able to learn efficient annotation
strategies in several scenarios, automatically adapting to the image
difficulty, the desired quality of the boxes, and the detector strength; (2) in
all scenarios the resulting annotation dialogs speed up annotation compared to
manual box drawing alone and box verification alone, while also outperforming
any fixed combination of verification and drawing in most scenarios; (3) in a
realistic scenario where the detector is iteratively re-trained, our agents
evolve a series of strategies that reflect the shifting trade-off between
verification and drawing as the detector grows stronger.",1712.08087v3,cs.CV,2017-12-21 17:07:01+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Ksenia Konyushkova'), arxiv.Result.Author('Jasper Uijlings'), arxiv.Result.Author('Christoph Lampert'), arxiv.Result.Author('Vittorio Ferrari')]",

unseen classes and is transferable to other tasks beyond supervised object

regressor, dubbed Universal Bounding-Box Regressor (UBBR), which predicts a

identify the local linear subspace of polynomials spanned by the box spline
translates. We use the global super-smoothness properties of box splines as
well as the additional super-smoothness conditions at edges to characterize the
spline space spanned by the box spline translates. Subsequently, we prove the
completeness of this space space with respect to the local polynomial space
induced by the box spline translates. The completeness property allows the
construction of hierarchical spaces spanned by the translates of box splines

strategic boxes is motivated by a wide range of real-world economic
applications for Pandora's box. For example, to encourage buyers to purchase,
sellers for goods such as TVs or houses may strategically conceal some
information about their products in order to influence buyer's valuations of

informational properties of Pandora's Box by analyzing how a box's partial

prism) trap. The droplet lattice is always formed in the $x$-$y$ plane
perpendicular to the polarization $z$ direction of dipolar atoms. In contrast
to a harmonic trap, the box traps allow the formation of a large clean
supersolid-like spatially-periodic crystallization in free space without any
distortion. Moreover, a droplet lattice can be formed in a 3D box trap with a
significantly reduced number of atoms than in a harmonic trap, which could
facilitate the experimental observation of droplet lattice in a box trap. With
present know-how such a supersolid-like crystallization of dipolar droplets in

$\{\ell\leq x \leq u\}$ is integer. We define principally box-integer polyhedra
to be the polyhedra $P$ such that $kP$ is box-integer whenever $kP$ is integer.
We characterize them in several ways, involving equimodular matrices and
box-total dual integral (box-TDI) systems. A rational $r\times n$ matrix is
equimodular if it has full row rank and its nonzero $r\times r$ determinants
all have the same absolute value. A face-defining matrix is a full row rank
matrix describing the affine hull of a face of the polyhedron. Box-TDI systems
are systems which yield strong min-max relations, and the underlying polyhedron
is called a box-TDI polyhedron. Our main result is that the following
statements are equivalent.
  - The polyhedron $P$ is principally box-integer.
  - The polyhedron $P$ is box-TDI.
  - Every face-defining matrix of $P$ is equimodular.
  - Every face of $P$ has an equimodular face-defining matrix.
  - Every face of $P$ has a totally unimodular face-defining matrix.
  - For every face $F$ of $P$, lin($F$) has a totally unimodular basis.
  Along our proof, we show that a cone $\{x:Ax\leq \mathbf{0}\}$ is box-TDI if
and only if it is box-integer, and that these properties are passed on to its
polar.
  We illustrate the use of these characterizations by reviewing well known
results about box-TDI polyhedra. We also provide several applications. The
first one is a new perspective on the equivalence between two results about
binary clutters. Secondly, we refute a conjecture of Ding, Zang, and Zhao about
box-perfect graphs. Thirdly, we discuss connections with an abstract class of

votes across the network by updating the states of interacting nodes using two
key operations, the union and the intersection. The proposed algorithm is
simple, independent from network size, and easily scalable in terms of the
number of choices $K$, using only $K\times 2^{K-1}$ nodal states for voting,

optimal in the ranking case, this optimality is conjectured to also apply to

1362,Exploring Weak Strategy-Proofness in Voting Theory,"Voting is the aggregation of individual preferences in order to select a
winning alternative. Selection of a winner is accomplished via a voting rule,
e.g., rank-order voting, majority rule, plurality rule, approval voting. Which
voting rule should be used? In social choice theory, desirable properties of
voting rules are expressed as axioms to be satisfied. This thesis focuses on
axioms concerning strategic manipulation by voters. Sometimes, voters may
intentionally misstate their true preferences in order to alter the outcome for
their own advantage. For example, in plurality rule, if a voter knows that
their top-choice candidate will lose, then they might instead vote for their
second-choice candidate just to avoid an even less desirable result. When no
coalition of voters can strategically manipulate, then the voting rule is said
to satisfy the axiom of Strategy-Proofness. A less restrictive axiom is Weak
Strategy-Proofness (as defined by Dasgupta and Maskin (2019)), which allows for
strategic manipulation by all but the smallest coalitions. Under certain
intuitive conditions, Dasgupta and Maskin (2019) proved that the only voting
rules satisfying Strategy-Proofness are rank-order voting and majority rule. In
my thesis, I generalize their result, by proving that rank-order voting and
majority rule are surprisingly still the only voting rules satisfying Weak

small probability, independently of the other votes. It is desirable to keep
the outcome of the election the same, regardless of the changes to the votes.
It is well known that the US electoral college system is about 5 times more
likely to have a changed outcome due to vote corruption, when compared to a
majority vote. In fact, Mossel, O'Donnell and Oleszkiewicz proved in 2005 that
the majority voting method is most stable to this random vote corruption, among
voting methods where each person has a small influence on the election. We
discuss some recent progress on the analogous result for elections between more
than two candidates. In this case, plurality should be most stable to
corruption in votes. We also survey results on adversarial election
manipulation (where an adversary can select particular votes to change, perhaps
in a non-random way), and we briefly discuss ranked choice voting methods

Conjecture to the setting of ranked choice voting. Since the plurality function
does not satisfy the Condorcet Loser Criterion, our new conjecture is not
directly related to the Plurality is Stablest Conjecture. Nevertheless, we show
that the Plurality is Stablest Conjecture implies our new Borda count is
Stablest conjecture. We therefore deduce that Borda count is stablest for
elections with three candidates when the corrupted votes are nearly
uncorrelated with the original votes. We also adapt a dimension reduction
argument to this setting, showing that the optimal ranked choice voting method
is ""low-dimensional.""
  The Condorcet Loser Criterion asserts that a candidate must lose an election

strategic voters worse off than they would have been had they not tried to

strategic voters all have the same sincere preferences and all cast the same
strategic vote, while all other voters vote sincerely. Most mis-coordinations
in this framework can be classified as instances of either strategic
overshooting (too many voted strategically) or strategic undershooting (too
few). If mis-coordination can result in strategic voters ending up worse off
than they would have been had they all just voted sincerely, we call the
relevant strategic vote unsafe. We show that under every onto and
non-dictatorial social choice rule there exist circumstances where a voter has
an incentive to cast a safe strategic vote. We extend the Gibbard-Satterthwaite

problems on metric spaces, we compare voting with and without the use of
proxies to see which mechanism better approximates the optimal outcome, and
characterize the regimes in which proxy voting is beneficial. When voters'
opinions are located on an interval, both the median mechanism and the mean
mechanism are substantially improved by proxy voting. When voters vote on many
binary issues, proxy voting is better when the sample of active voters is too
small to provide a good outcome. Our theoretical results extend to situations
where available voters choose strategically whether to participate. We support

proxy voting on simulated and real preference data.",1611.08308v1,cs.GT,2016-11-24 21:05:50+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Gal Cohensius'), arxiv.Result.Author('Shie Manor'), arxiv.Result.Author('Reshef Meir'), arxiv.Result.Author('Eli Meirom'), arxiv.Result.Author('Ariel Orda')]",

The weights attached to positive and negative votes in calculating a
candidate's net score may be different, so that a negative vote and a positive
vote need not cancel out exactly. These rules combine the first-place seeking
incentives of plurality with the incentives to avoid being ranked last of
anti-plurality. We show that these rules generally admit equilibria, which are
nonconvergent if and only if the importance of a positive vote exceeds that of
a negative vote. The set of equilibria in the latter case is very similar to
that of plurality, except that the platforms are less extreme due to the
moderating effect of negative votes. Moreover, any degree of dispersion between
plurality, at one extreme, and full convergence, at the other, can be attained

The models are applied to data collected from hundreds of people in controlled

information. We introduce a new voting model, the Attainability- Utility (AU)

1375,BBB-Voting: 1-out-of-k Blockchain-Based Boardroom Voting,"Voting is a means to agree on a collective decision based on available
choices (e.g., candidates), where participants (voters) agree to abide by their
outcome. To improve some features of e-voting, decentralized solutions based on
a blockchain can be employed, where the blockchain represents a public bulletin
board that in contrast to a centralized bulletin board provides $100\%$
availability and censorship resistance. A blockchain ensures that all entities
in the voting system have the same view of the actions made by others due to
its immutable and append-only log. The existing blockchain-based boardroom
voting solution called Open Voting Network (OVN) provides the privacy of votes
and perfect ballot secrecy, but it supports only two candidates. We present
BBB-Voting, an equivalent blockchain-based approach for decentralized voting
than OVN, but in contrast to it, BBB-Voting supports 1-out-of-$k$ choices and
provides a fault tolerance mechanism that enables recovery from stalling
participants. We provide a cost-optimized implementation using Ethereum, which
we compare with OVN and show that our work decreases the costs for voters by
$13.5\%$ in terms of gas consumption. Next, we outline the extension of our
implementation scaling to magnitudes higher number of participants than in a

1376,Digital herders and phase transition in a voting model,"In this paper, we discuss a voting model with two candidates, C_1 and C_2. We
set two types of voters--herders and independents. The voting of independent
voters is based on their fundamental values; on the other hand, the voting of
herders is based on the number of votes. Herders always select the majority of
the previous $r$ votes, which is visible to them. We call them digital herders.
We can accurately calculate the distribution of votes for special cases. When
r>=3, we find that a phase transition occurs at the upper limit of t, where t
is the discrete time (or number of votes). As the fraction of herders
increases, the model features a phase transition beyond which a state where
most voters make the correct choice coexists with one where most of them are
wrong. On the other hand, when r<3, there is no phase transition. In this case,
the herders' performance is the same as that of the independent voters.

Specifically, given a voting rule, we wish to design a weighting scheme such
that applying the voting rule, with voters weighted by the scheme, leads to
choices that are almost as good as those endorsed by the best voter in
hindsight. We derive possibility and impossibility results for the existence of
such weighting schemes, depending on whether the voting rule and the weighting

1379,BVOT: Self-Tallying Boardroom Voting with Oblivious Transfer,"A boardroom election is an election with a small number of voters carried out
with public communications. We present BVOT, a self-tallying boardroom voting
protocol with ballot secrecy, fairness (no tally information is available
before the polls close), and dispute-freeness (voters can observe that all
voters correctly followed the protocol).
  BVOT works by using a multiparty threshold homomorphic encryption system in
which each candidate is associated with a masked unique prime. Each voter
engages in an oblivious transfer with an untrusted distributor: the voter
selects the index of a prime associated with a candidate and receives the
selected prime in masked form. The voter then casts their vote by encrypting
their masked prime and broadcasting it to everyone. The distributor does not
learn the voter's choice, and no one learns the mapping between primes and
candidates until the audit phase. By hiding the mapping between primes and
candidates, BVOT provides voters with insufficient information to carry out
effective cheating. The threshold feature prevents anyone from computing any
partial tally---until everyone has voted. Multiplying all votes, their
decryption shares, and the unmasking factor yields a product of the primes each
raised to the number of votes received.
  In contrast to some existing boardroom voting protocols, BVOT does not rely
on any zero-knowledge proof; instead, it uses oblivious transfer to assure
ballot secrecy and correct vote casting. Also, BVOT can handle multiple
candidates in one election. BVOT prevents cheating by hiding crucial
information: an attempt to increase the tally of one candidate might increase
the tally of another candidate. After all votes are cast, any party can tally
the votes.",2010.02421v1,cs.CR,2020-10-06 01:28:34+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Farid Javani'), arxiv.Result.Author('Alan T. Sherman')]",

worse characteristics than the optimal circulants, compensate by one-length

paper considers three different approaches to routing in NoCs with ring

the operation direction of the circulator. This working principle is compatible
with preparing the circulator in a coherent superposition of its operational

planning, and underlying terrain. In turn, it impacts how humans use urban
space for settlement and travel. Although past research has examined overall
street network circuity, researchers have not studied the relative circuity of
walkable versus drivable circulation networks. This study uses OpenStreetMap
data to explore relative network circuity. We download walkable and drivable
networks for 40 US cities using the OSMnx software, which we then use to
simulate four million routes and analyze circuity to characterize network
structure. We find that walking networks tend to allow for more direct routes
than driving networks do in most cities: average driving circuity exceeds
average walking circuity in all but four of the cities that exhibit
statistically significant differences between network types. We discuss various
reasons for this phenomenon, illustrated with case studies. Network circuity
also varies substantially between different types of places. These findings
underscore the value of using network-based distances and times rather than

exchanges between a two-dimensional geostrophically-balanced front undergoing
strain-induced semigeostrophic frontogenesis and internal wave (IW) vertical
modes. The quasilinear model is solved numerically for variable imposed strain
magnitudes, initial IW vertical modes, and for both minimum frequency
(near-inertial, NI) and high-frequency IWs. The front-IW KE exchanges are
quantified separately during two frontogenetic stages -- an exponential
sharpening stage that is characterized by a low Rossby number and is driven by
the imposed geostrophic strain, followed by a superexponential sharpening stage
that is characterized by an order-one Rossby number and is driven by the
convergence of the ageostrophic secondary circulation. It is demonstrated that
high-frequency IWs quickly escape the frontal zone and are very efficient at
extracting KE from the imposed geostrophic strain field through the deformation
shear production (DSP) mechanism. Part of the extracted KE is then converted to
wave potential energy. Minimum frequency IWs remain locked to the frontal zone
and therefore exchange energy with the ageostrophic frontal circulation. During
the exponential stage, IWs extract KE from the geostrophic strain through DSP
and transfer it to the frontal secondary circulation via the ageostrophic shear
production (AGSP) mechanism. During the superexponential stage a newly

considered a gene, and each network is considered a chromosome. In fact, in
this step, different routes from diverse solutions are combined as a unique
feeder network. Tehran District 10 was selected as the case study and the model
was tested on this area which is located near the central business districts. A
machine learning approach has been applied to estimate the missing values of
the related database. Results: By running the algorithm, four feeder routes
were obtained with reasonable travel times and distances of 4.8, 5.5, 5.8, and
8.1 km, starting and ending at the same railway station. Moreover, 98% of the

1398,The reconfigurable Josephson circulator/directional amplifier,"Circulators and directional amplifiers are crucial non-reciprocal signal
routing and processing components involved in microwave readout chains for a
variety of applications. They are particularly important in the field of
superconducting quantum information, where the devices also need to have
minimal photon losses to preserve the quantum coherence of signals.
Conventional commercial implementations of each device suffer from losses and
are built from very different physical principles, which has led to separate
strategies for the construction of their quantum-limited versions. However, as
recently proposed theoretically, by establishing simultaneous pairwise
conversion and/or gain processes between three modes of a Josephson-junction
based superconducting microwave circuit, it is possible to endow the circuit
with the functions of either a phase-preserving directional amplifier or a
circulator. Here, we experimentally demonstrate these two modes of operation of
the same circuit. Furthermore, in the directional amplifier mode, we show that
the noise performance is comparable to standard non-directional superconducting
amplifiers, while in the circulator mode, we show that the sense of circulation
is fully reversible. Our device is far simpler in both modes of operation than
previous proposals and implementations, requiring only three microwave pumps.
It offers the advantage of flexibility, as it can dynamically switch between
modes of operation as its pump conditions are changed. Moreover, by
demonstrating that a single three-wave process yields non-reciprocal devices
with reconfigurable functions, our work breaks the ground for the development
of future, more-complex directional circuits, and has excellent prospects for
on-chip integration.",1503.00209v4,quant-ph,2015-03-01 03:23:09+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('K. M. Sliwa'), arxiv.Result.Author('M. Hatridge'), arxiv.Result.Author('A.

1400,Civic Engagement among Early Internet Adopters: Trend or Phase?,"This paper brings evidence to bear on the question of the long-term effects
of Internet diffusion on civic engagement in geographic communities. It draws
on findings from survey data collected in four U.S. towns and cities in fall
2000 where community computer networking is established. The study shows that
early adopters of the Internet are more likely to engage in civic activities
and to have higher levels of community involvement than later adopters.
Further, early adopters are more likely to use the Internet to increase their
community involvement and political participation. Later adopters in all four
sites show less involvement in their local community and less interest in
political activity and information, online or offline. These findings reinforce
those of the Kohut (1999) study showing that later adopters are less civic
minded and more interested than early adopters in consumer and commercial
applications, such as shopping and entertainment. The evidence in these four
sites is consistent with earlier findings in Blacksburg, Virginia (Kavanaugh,
2000; Patterson and Kavanaugh, 2001; Kavanaugh and Patterson, 2001) and other
studies of early innovation adopters (Rogers, 1983; Kohut, 1999; Valente, 1995,
among others). The results reported in this paper lend weight to the argument
that increases in civic engagement and community involvement are due primarily
to the behavior of early adopters, making such increases a phase, not a trend.
As later adopters come on line, use of the Internet for community involvement
or civic engagement decreases. In the long term, we can expect that Internet
access may have only a modest effect on community involvement and civic
engagement in geographic communities.",cs/0109087v2,cs.CY,2001-09-24 21:52:10+00:00,[arxiv.Result.Author('Andrea L. Kavanaugh')],

1404,Local Interactions and the Emergence of a Twitter Small-World Network,"The small-world phenomenon is found in many self-organising systems. Systems
configured in small-world networks spread information more easily than in
random or regular lattice-type networks. Whilst it is a known fact that
small-world networks have short average path length and high clustering
coefficient in self-organising systems, the ego centralities that maintain the
cohesiveness of small-world network have not been formally defined. Here we
show that instantaneous events such as the release of news items via Twitter,
coupled with active community arguments related to the news item form a
particular type of small-world network. Analysis of the centralities in the
network reveals that community arguments maintain the small-world network
whilst actively maintaining the cohesiveness and boundary of the group. The
results demonstrate how an active Twitter community unconsciously forms a
small-world network whilst interacting locally with a bordering community. Over
time, such local interactions brought about the global emergence of the
small-world network, connecting media channels with human activities.
Understanding the small-world phenomenon in relation to online social or civic
movement is important, as evident in the spate of online activists that tipped
the power of governments for the better or worst in recent times. The support,
or removal of high centrality nodes in such networks has important
ramifications in the self-expression of society and civic discourses. The
presentation in this article anticipates further exploration of man-made

smart city initiatives. Governments around the world are adopting technology
for faster resolution of civic issues. Typically, citizens report issues, such
as broken roads, garbage dumps, etc. through web portals and mobile apps, in
order for the government authorities to take appropriate actions. Several
mediums -- text, image, audio, video -- are used to report these issues.
Through a user study with 13 citizens and 3 authorities, we found that image is
the most preferred medium to report civic issues. However, analyzing civic
issue related images is challenging for the authorities as it requires manual
effort. Moreover, previous works have been limited to identifying a specific
set of issues from images. In this work, given an image, we propose to generate
a Civic Issue Graph consisting of a set of objects and the semantic relations
between them, which are representative of the underlying civic issue. We also
release two multi-modal (text and images) datasets, that can help in further
analysis of civic issues from images. We present a novel approach for
adversarial training of existing scene graph models that enables the use of

temporal networks evolving over time. Abrupt changes in urban dynamics caused
by events such as disruption of civic operations, mass crowd gatherings,
holidays and natural disasters are potentially reflected in these temporal

developments is of critical importance for transportation planning and
security. Anomaly detection from high dimensional network data is a challenging
task as edge level measurements often have low values and high variance

1421,Identifying Possible Winners in Ranked Choice Voting Elections with Outstanding Ballots,"Several election districts in the US have recently moved to ranked-choice
voting (RCV) to decide the results of local elections. RCV allows voters to
rank their choices, and the results are computed in rounds, eliminating one
candidate at a time. RCV ensures fairer elections and has been shown to
increase elected representation of women and people of color. A main drawback
of RCV is that the round-by-round process requires all the ballots to be
tallied before the results of an election can be calculated. With increasingly
large portions of ballots coming from absentee voters, RCV election outcomes
are not always apparent on election night, and can take several weeks to be
published, leading to a loss of trust in the electoral process from the public.
In this paper, we present an algorithm for efficiently computing possible
winners of RCV elections from partially known ballots and evaluate it on data
from the recent New York City Primary elections. We show that our techniques
allow to significantly narrow down the field of possible election winners, and
in some case identify the winner as soon as election night despite a number of

fill these absentee-voxels so as to generate a spherical surface of revolution,
which is more realistic from the viewpoint of visual perception. We further
show that covering a solid sphere by a set of complete spheres also results in
an asymptotically larger count of absentees, which is cubic in the radius of
the sphere. The characterization and generation of complete solid spheres
without any holes can also be accomplished in a similar fashion. We furnish

1423,Limiting Risk by Turning Manifest Phantoms into Evil Zombies,"Drawing a random sample of ballots to conduct a risk-limiting audit generally
requires knowing how the ballots cast in an election are organized into groups,
for instance, how many containers of ballots there are in all and how many
ballots are in each container. A list of the ballot group identifiers along
with number of ballots in each group is called a ballot manifest. What if the
ballot manifest is not accurate? Surprisingly, even if ballots are known to be
missing from the manifest, it is not necessary to make worst-case assumptions
about those ballots--for instance, to adjust the margin by the number of
missing ballots--to ensure that the audit remains conservative. Rather, it
suffices to make worst-case assumptions about the individual randomly selected
ballots that the audit cannot find. This observation provides a simple
modification to some risk-limiting audit procedures that makes them
automatically become more conservative if the ballot manifest has errors. The
modification--phantoms to evil zombies (~2EZ)--requires only an upper bound on
the total number of ballots cast. ~2EZ makes the audit P-value stochastically
larger than it would be had the manifest been accurate, automatically requiring
more than enough ballots to be audited to offset the manifest errors. This
ensures that the true risk limit remains smaller than the nominal risk limit.
On the other hand, if the manifest is in fact accurate and the upper bound on
the total number of ballots equals the total according to the manifest, ~2EZ
has no effect at all on the number of ballots audited nor on the true risk
limit.",1207.3413v1,stat.AP,2012-07-14 11:26:02+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Jorge H. Banuelos'), arxiv.Result.Author('Philip B. Stark')]",

printed ballot after making their selections on a Ballot Marking Device (BMD).
In this study, we altered votes on a voter's ballot after they had made their
selections on a BMD. We then required them to examine their ballots for any
changes from the slate they used to vote. Overall accuracy was exceptionally
high. Participants saw 1440 total contests, and of those 1440, there were a
total of 4 errors, so total accuracy was 99.8%. Participants were able to
perform with near-perfect accuracy regardless of ballot length, ballot type,
number of altered races, and location of altered races. Detection performance
was extremely robust. We conclude that with proper direction and resources,
voters can be near-perfect detectors of ballot changes on printed paper ballots
after voting with a BMD. This finding has significant implications for the
voting community as BMD use continues to grow. Research should now focus on
identifying administrative and behavioral methods that will prompt and

1426,Nurse Staffing under Absenteeism: A Distributionally Robust Optimization Approach,"We study the nurse staffing problem under random nurse demand and
absenteeism. While the demand uncertainty is exogenous (stemming from the
random patient census), the absenteeism uncertainty is \emph{endogenous}, i.e.,
the number of nurses who show up for work partially depends on the nurse
staffing level. For quality of care, many hospitals have developed float pools,
i.e., groups of hospital units, and trained nurses to be able to work in
multiple units (termed cross-training) in response to potential nurse shortage.
In this paper, we propose a distributionally robust nurse staffing (DRNS) model
that considers both exogenous and endogenous uncertainties. We derive a
separation algorithm to solve this model under a general structure of float
pools. In addition, we identify several pool structures that often arise in
practice and recast the corresponding DRNS model as a mixed-integer linear
program, which facilitates off-the-shelf commercial solvers. Furthermore, we
optimize the float pool design to reduce cross-training while achieving
specified target staffing costs. The numerical case studies, based on the data
of a collaborating hospital, suggest that the units with high absenteeism
probability should be pooled together.",1909.09875v2,math.OC,2019-09-21 19:15:54+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Minseok Ryu'), arxiv.Result.Author('Ruiwei Jiang')]",

1428,Double Standards: The Implications of Near Certainty Drone Strikes in Pakistan,"In 2013, U.S. President Barack Obama announced a policy to minimize civilian
casualties following drone strikes in undeclared theaters of war. The policy
calibrated Obamas approval of strikes against the near certainty of no civilian
casualties. Scholars do not empirically study the merits of Obamas policy.
Rather, they rely on descriptive trends for civilian casualties in Pakistan to
justify competing claims for the policys impact. We provide a novel estimate
for the impact of Obamas policy for civilian casualties in Pakistan following
U.S. drone strikes. We employ a regression discontinuity design to estimate the
effect of Obamas policy for civilian casualties, strike precision, and adverted
civilian casualties. We find a discontinuity in civilian casualties
approximately two years before Obamas policy announcement, corroborating our
primary research including interviews with senior officials responsible for
implementing the near certainty standard. After confirming the sharp cutoff, we
estimate the policy resulted in a reduction of 12 civilian deaths per month or
2 casualties per strike. The policy also enhanced the precision of U.S. drone
strikes to the point that they only killed the intended targets. Finally, we
use a Monte Carlo simulation to estimate that the policy adverted 320 civilian
casualties. We then conduct a Value of Statistical Life calculation to show
that the adverted civilian casualties represent a gain of 80 to 260 million
U.S. dollars. In addition to conditioning social and political outcomes, then,
the near certainty standard also imposed economic implications that are much

into subgroups (or districts), the adversary can construct a so-called ""Devil's
Menu"" consisting of several prices. In equilibrium, the adversary can buy the
real ballots of any strict subset of districts at a price corresponding to the
willingness to sell on the part of the citizens holding such ballots. By
contrast, decoy voters are trapped into selling their ballots at a low, or even
negligible, price. Blowing up the adversary's budget by introducing decoy
ballots may thus turn out to be futile. The Devil's Menu can also be applied to

1431,The ATHENA Class of Risk-Limiting Ballot Polling Audits,"The main risk-limiting ballot polling audit in use today, BRAVO, is designed
for use when single ballots are drawn at random and a decision regarding
whether to stop the audit or draw another ballot is taken after each ballot
draw (ballot-by-ballot (B2) audits). On the other hand, real ballot polling
audits draw many ballots in a single round before determining whether to stop
(round-by-round (R2) audits). We show that BRAVO results in significant
inefficiency when directly applied to real R2 audits. We present the ATHENA
class of R2 stopping rules, which we show are risk-limiting if the round
schedule is pre-determined (before the audit begins). We prove that each rule
is at least as efficient as the corresponding BRAVO stopping rule applied at
the end of the round. We have open-source software libraries implementing most
of our results.
  We show that ATHENA halves the number of ballots required, for all state
margins in the 2016 US Presidential election and a first round with $90\%$
stopping probability, when compared to BRAVO (stopping rule applied at the end
of the round). We present simulation results supporting the 90% stopping
probability claims and our claims for the risk accrued in the first round.
Further, ATHENA reduces the number of ballots by more than a quarter for low
margins, when compared to the BRAVO stopping rule applied on ballots in
selection order. This implies that keeping track of the order when drawing
ballots R2 is not beneficial, because ATHENA is more efficient even without
information on selection order. These results are significant because current
approaches to real ballot polling election audits use the B2 BRAVO rules,
requiring about twice as much work on the part of election officials. Applying
the rules in selection order requires fewer ballots, but keeping track of the
order, and entering it into audit software, adds to the effort.",2008.02315v5,cs.CR,2020-08-05 18:47:37+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Filip Zagórski'), arxiv.Result.Author('Grant McClearn'), arxiv.Result.Author('Sarah Morin'), arxiv.Result.Author('Neal McBurnett'), arxiv.Result.Author('Poorvi L.

1432,Integration of a machine learning model into a decision support tool to predict absenteeism at work of prospective employees,"Purpose - Inefficient hiring may result in lower productivity and higher
training costs. Productivity losses caused by absenteeism at work cost U.S.
employers billions of dollars each year. Also, employers typically spend a
considerable amount of time managing employees who perform poorly. The purpose
of this study is to develop a decision support tool to predict absenteeism

open-access dataset. In order to categorize absenteeism classes, the data have
been preprocessed, and four methods of machine learning classification have
been applied: Multinomial Logistic Regression (MLR), Support Vector Machines
(SVM), Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), and Random Forests (RF). We selected
the best model, based on several validation scores, and compared its
performance against the existing model; we then integrated the best model into
our proposed web-based for hiring managers. Findings - A web-based decision
tool allows hiring managers to make more informed decisions before hiring a
potential employee, thus reducing time, financial loss and reducing the
probability of economic insolvency. Originality/value - In this paper, we
propose a model that is trained based on attributes that can be collected
during the hiring process. Furthermore, hiring managers may lack experience in
machine learning or do not have the time to spend developing machine learning
algorithms. Thus, we propose a web-based interactive tool that can be used

justifiably high confidence that the reported results of an election are

SOBA combines three ideas: (1) publishing cast vote records (CVRs) separately
for each contest, so that anyone can verify that each reported contest outcome
is correct, if the CVRs reflect voters' intentions with sufficient accuracy;
(2) shrouding a mapping between ballots and the CVRs for those ballots to
prevent the loss of privacy that could occur otherwise; (3) assessing the
accuracy with which the CVRs reflect voters' intentions for a collection of
contests while simultaneously assessing the integrity of the shrouded mapping

Results indicated that of those voters who chose to examine the printed ballot,

1443,Nurse Staffing under Absenteeism: A Distributionally Robust Optimization Approach,"We study the nurse staffing problem under random nurse demand and
absenteeism. While the demand uncertainty is exogenous (stemming from the
random patient census), the absenteeism uncertainty is \emph{endogenous}, i.e.,
the number of nurses who show up for work partially depends on the nurse
staffing level. For quality of care, many hospitals have developed float pools,
i.e., groups of hospital units, and trained nurses to be able to work in
multiple units (termed cross-training) in response to potential nurse shortage.
In this paper, we propose a distributionally robust nurse staffing (DRNS) model
that considers both exogenous and endogenous uncertainties. We derive a
separation algorithm to solve this model under a general structure of float
pools. In addition, we identify several pool structures that often arise in
practice and recast the corresponding DRNS model as a mixed-integer linear
program, which facilitates off-the-shelf commercial solvers. Furthermore, we
optimize the float pool design to reduce cross-training while achieving
specified target staffing costs. The numerical case studies, based on the data
of a collaborating hospital, suggest that the units with high absenteeism
probability should be pooled together.",1909.09875v2,math.OC,2019-09-21 19:15:54+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Minseok Ryu'), arxiv.Result.Author('Ruiwei Jiang')]",

decoding is optimal, i.e., joint decoding of the bee barcodes does not result
in a better error exponent relative to independent decoding of each noisy
barcode. This is in contrast to the result without absentee bees, where joint
barcode decoding results in a significantly higher error exponent than
independent barcode decoding. We also define and characterize the ""capacity""

1445,Double Standards: The Implications of Near Certainty Drone Strikes in Pakistan,"In 2013, U.S. President Barack Obama announced a policy to minimize civilian
casualties following drone strikes in undeclared theaters of war. The policy
calibrated Obamas approval of strikes against the near certainty of no civilian
casualties. Scholars do not empirically study the merits of Obamas policy.
Rather, they rely on descriptive trends for civilian casualties in Pakistan to
justify competing claims for the policys impact. We provide a novel estimate
for the impact of Obamas policy for civilian casualties in Pakistan following
U.S. drone strikes. We employ a regression discontinuity design to estimate the
effect of Obamas policy for civilian casualties, strike precision, and adverted
civilian casualties. We find a discontinuity in civilian casualties
approximately two years before Obamas policy announcement, corroborating our
primary research including interviews with senior officials responsible for
implementing the near certainty standard. After confirming the sharp cutoff, we
estimate the policy resulted in a reduction of 12 civilian deaths per month or
2 casualties per strike. The policy also enhanced the precision of U.S. drone
strikes to the point that they only killed the intended targets. Finally, we
use a Monte Carlo simulation to estimate that the policy adverted 320 civilian
casualties. We then conduct a Value of Statistical Life calculation to show
that the adverted civilian casualties represent a gain of 80 to 260 million
U.S. dollars. In addition to conditioning social and political outcomes, then,
the near certainty standard also imposed economic implications that are much
less studied.",2112.11565v1,econ.GN,2021-12-20 04:53:48+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Shyam Raman'), arxiv.Result.Author('Paul Lushenko'), arxiv.Result.Author('Sarah Kreps')]",
1446,Integration of a machine learning model into a decision support tool to predict absenteeism at work of prospective employees,"Purpose - Inefficient hiring may result in lower productivity and higher
training costs. Productivity losses caused by absenteeism at work cost U.S.
employers billions of dollars each year. Also, employers typically spend a
considerable amount of time managing employees who perform poorly. The purpose
of this study is to develop a decision support tool to predict absenteeism
among potential employees. Design/methodology/approach - We utilized a popular
open-access dataset. In order to categorize absenteeism classes, the data have
been preprocessed, and four methods of machine learning classification have
been applied: Multinomial Logistic Regression (MLR), Support Vector Machines
(SVM), Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), and Random Forests (RF). We selected
the best model, based on several validation scores, and compared its
performance against the existing model; we then integrated the best model into
our proposed web-based for hiring managers. Findings - A web-based decision
tool allows hiring managers to make more informed decisions before hiring a
potential employee, thus reducing time, financial loss and reducing the
probability of economic insolvency. Originality/value - In this paper, we
propose a model that is trained based on attributes that can be collected
during the hiring process. Furthermore, hiring managers may lack experience in
machine learning or do not have the time to spend developing machine learning
algorithms. Thus, we propose a web-based interactive tool that can be used
without prior knowledge of machine learning algorithms.",2202.03577v1,cs.LG,2022-02-02 03:49:01+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Gopal Nath'), arxiv.Result.Author('Antoine Harfouche'), arxiv.Result.Author('Austin Coursey'), arxiv.Result.Author('Krishna K.

1447,"Polarization, Abstention, and the Median Voter Theorem","The median voter theorem has long been the default model of voter behavior
and candidate choice. While contemporary work on the distribution of political
opinion has emphasized polarization and an increasing gap between the ""left""
and the ""right"" in democracies, the median voter theorem presents a model of
anti-polarization: competing candidates move to the center of the ideological
distribution to maximize vote share, regardless of the underlying ideological
distribution of voters. These anti-polar results, however, largely depend on
the ""singled-peakedness"" of voter preferences, an assumption that is rapidly
loosing relevance in the age of polarization. This article presents a model of
voter choice that examines three potential mechanisms that can undermine this
finding: a relative cost of voting that deters voters who are sufficiently
indifferent to both candidates, ideologically motivated third-party
alternatives that attract extreme voters, and a bimodal distribution of voter
ideology. Under reasonable sets of conditions and empirically observed voter
opinion distributions, these mechanisms can be sufficient to cause
strategically-minded candidates to fail to converge to the center, or to even
become more polarized than their electorate.",2103.12847v1,physics.soc-ph,2021-03-23 21:14:22+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Matthew I. Jones'), arxiv.Result.Author('Antonio D. Sirianni'), arxiv.Result.Author('Feng Fu')]",
1448,A Fault Tolerance Improved Majority Voter for TMR System Architectures,"For digital system designs, triple modular redundancy (TMR), which is a
3-tuple version of N-modular redundancy is widely preferred for many
mission-control and safety-critical applications. The TMR scheme involves
two-times duplication of the simplex system hardware, with a majority voter
ensuring correctness provided at least two out of three copies of the system
remain operational. Thus the majority voter plays a pivotal role in ensuring
the correct operation of the system. The fundamental assumption implicit in the
TMR scheme is that the majority voter does not become faulty, which may not
hold well for implementations based on latest technology nodes with dimensions
of the order of just tens of nanometers. To overcome the drawbacks of the
classical majority voter some new voter designs were put forward in the
literature with the aim of enhancing the fault tolerance. However, these voter
designs generally ensure the correct system operation in the presence of either
a faulty function module or the faulty voter, considered only in isolation.
Since multiple faults may no longer be excluded in the nanoelectronics regime,
simultaneous fault occurrences on both the function module and the voter should
be considered, and the fault tolerance of the voters have to be analyzed under
such a scenario. In this context, this article proposes a new fault-tolerant
majority voter which is found to be more robust to faults than the existing
voters in the presence of faults occurring internally and/or externally to the
voter. Moreover, the proposed voter features less power dissipation, delay, and
area metrics based on the simulation results obtained by using a 32/28nm CMOS

1449,On the Computational Complexity of Variants of Combinatorial Voter Control in Elections,"Voter control problems model situations in which an external agent tries
toaffect the result of an election by adding or deleting the fewest number of
voters. The goal of the agent is to make a specific candidate either win
(\emph{constructive} control) or lose (\emph{destructive} control) the
election. We study the constructive and destructive voter control problems
whenadding and deleting voters have a \emph{combinatorial flavor}: If we add
(resp.\ delete) a voter~$v$, we also add (resp.\ delete) a bundle~$\kappa(v) $
of voters that are associated with~$v$. While the bundle~$\kappa(v)$ may have
more than one voter, a voter may also be associated with more than one voter.
We analyze the computational complexity of the four voter control problems for
the Plurality rule. We obtain that, in general, making a candidate lose is
computationally easier than making her win. In particular, if the bundling
relation is symmetric (i.e.\ $\forall w\colon w \in \kappa(v) \Leftrightarrow v
\in \kappa(w) $), and if each voter has at most two voters associated with him,
then destructive control is polynomial-time solvable while the constructive
variant remains $\NP$-hard. Even if the bundles are disjoint (i.e.\ $\forall
w\colon w \in \kappa(v) \Leftrightarrow \kappa(v) = \kappa(w) $), the
constructive problem variants remain intractable. Finally, the minimization
variant of constructive control by adding voters does not admit an efficient
approximation algorithm, unless P=NP.",1701.05108v1,cs.MA,2017-01-18 15:36:46+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Leon Kellerhals'), arxiv.Result.Author('Viatcheslav Korenwein'), arxiv.Result.Author('Philipp Zschoche'), arxiv.Result.Author('Robert Bredereck'), arxiv.Result.Author('Jiehua Chen')]",

these predictions by incorporating information on a municipality wide basis via
aggregate data to enhance our estimate under the assumption that nearby voters
have similar behavior, which could be due to social interaction or common
external factors. Finally, we use a ranking scheme on these predictions to
identify two key types of voter: 1) Voters who are likely to vote that we can
convince to vote for a given party; and, 2) Voters who are likely to vote for a
given party, if they vote, that we can convince to actually turn out to vote.
Once these voters have been identified, a political campaign can use this

communications among the military vehicles can be interfered by civilian users.
It is the desire that the messages transmitted by the military vehicles hold a
higher significance so that they can avoid the interference coming from the
civilian users, which is not supported in the current version of DSRC. As a
remedy, this paper proposes a protocol that prioritizes the military DSRC users

voter registration scheme enabling voters to create verifiable and
indistinguishable real and fake credentials using an untrusted kiosk inside a
privacy booth at a supervised location, e.g., the registrar's office. TRIP
ensures the integrity of the voter's real credential while enabling the
creation of fake credentials using interactive zero-knowledge proofs between
the voter as the verifier and the kiosk as the prover, unbeknownst to the
average voter. TRIP ensures that even voters who are under extreme coercion,
and cannot leave the booth with a real credential, can delegate their vote to a
political party, with the caveat that they must then trust the kiosk. TRIP
optimizes the tallying process by limiting the number of credentials a voter
can receive and capping the number of votes that a credential can cast per
election. We conduct a preliminary usability study among 41 participants at a
university and found that 42.5% of participants rated TRIP a B or higher in

aspects which impacts the overall learning process, and ultimately, course
attrition. Confusion for a learner is an individual state of bewilderment and
uncertainty of how to move forward. The majority of recent works neglect the
'individual' factor and measure the influence of community-related aspects
(e.g. votes, views) for confusion classification. While this is a useful
measure, as the popularity of one's post can indicate that many other students
have similar confusion regarding course topics, these models neglect the
personalised context, such as individual's affect or emotions. Certain
physiological aspects (e.g. facial expressions, heart rate) have been utilised
to classify confusion in small to medium classrooms. However, these techniques
are challenging to adopt to MOOCs. To bridge this gap, we propose an approach

1501,Improving Classification through Weak Supervision in Context-specific Conversational Agent Development for Teacher Education,"Machine learning techniques applied to the Natural Language Processing (NLP)
component of conversational agent development show promising results for
improved accuracy and quality of feedback that a conversational agent can
provide. The effort required to develop an educational scenario specific
conversational agent is time consuming as it requires domain experts to label
and annotate noisy data sources such as classroom videos. Previous approaches
to modeling annotations have relied on labeling thousands of examples and
calculating inter-annotator agreement and majority votes in order to model the
necessary scenarios. This method, while proven successful, ignores individual
annotator strengths in labeling a data point and under-utilizes examples that
do not have a majority vote for labeling. We propose using a multi-task weak
supervision method combined with active learning to address these concerns.
This approach requires less labeling than traditional methods and shows
significant improvements in precision, efficiency, and time-requirements than
the majority vote method (Ratner 2019). We demonstrate the validity of this
method on the Google Jigsaw data set and then propose a scenario to apply this
method using the Instructional Quality Assessment(IQA) to define the categories
for labeling. We propose using probabilistic modeling of annotator labeling to
generate active learning examples to further label the data. Active learning is
able to iteratively improve the training performance and accuracy of the
original classification model. This approach combines state-of-the art labeling
techniques of weak supervision and active learning to optimize results in the
educational domain and could be further used to lessen the data requirements

ranking for each student by aggregating the rankings of similar students using
different aspects of their performance on common questions. These aspects
include grades, number of retries, and time spent solving questions. It infers
a difficulty ranking directly over the questions for each student, rather than
ordering them according to the student's predicted score. The EduRank algorithm
was tested on two data sets containing thousands of students and a million
records. It was able to outperform the state-of-the-art ranking approaches as
well as a domain expert. EduRank was used by students in a classroom activity,

there is uncertainty about how others will vote. In this paper, we study
strategic voting when there is uncertainty about the voting method. We
introduce three notions of manipulability for a set of voting methods: sure,
safe, and expected manipulability. With the help of a computer program, we
identify voting scenarios in which uncertainty about the voting method may
reduce or even eliminate a voter's incentive to misrepresent her preferences.
Thus, it may be in the interest of an election designer who wishes to reduce
strategic voting to leave voters uncertain about which of several reasonable
voting methods will be used to determine the winners of an election.",1907.09110v1,cs.MA,2019-07-22 03:17:19+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Wesley H. Holliday'), arxiv.Result.Author('Eric Pacuit')]","EPTCS 297, 2019, pp. 252-272"
1507,Vote Delegation and Misbehavior,"We study vote delegation with ""well-behaving"" and ""misbehaving"" agents and
compare it with conventional voting. Typical examples for vote delegation are
validation or governance tasks on blockchains. There is a majority of
well-behaving agents, but they may abstain or delegate their vote to other
agents since voting is costly. Misbehaving agents always vote. We compare
conventional voting allowing for abstention with vote delegation. Preferences
of voters are private information and a positive outcome is achieved if
well-behaving agents win. We illustrate that vote delegation leads to quite
different outcomes than conventional voting with abstention. In particular, we
obtain three insights: First, if the number of misbehaving voters, denoted by f
, is high, both voting methods fail to deliver a positive outcome. Second, if f
takes an intermediate value, conventional voting delivers a positive outcome,
while vote delegation fails with probability one. Third, if f is low,

We study three of the most common methods used to modify voting rules to deal
with such partial votes. These methods modify scoring rules (like the Borda
count), elimination style rules (like single transferable vote) and rules based
on the tournament graph (like Copeland) respectively. We argue that with an
elimination style voting rule like single transferable vote, partial voting
does not change the situations where strategic voting is possible. However,
with scoring rules and rules based on the tournament graph, partial voting can
increase the situations where strategic voting is possible. As a consequence,
the computational complexity of computing a strategic vote can change. For
example, with Borda count, the complexity of computing a strategic vote can
decrease or stay the same depending on how we score partial votes.",1405.7714v1,cs.GT,2014-05-28 12:13:52+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Nina Narodytska'), arxiv.Result.Author('Toby Walsh')]",

There are many existing protocols for voting using smart contracts. We observe
that these either are not scalable or leak the vote tally during the voting
stage, i.e., do not provide vote concealment. In contrast, we show that FASTEN
preserves voter's privacy ensures vote concealment, immutability, and avoids

1514,Exploring Weak Strategy-Proofness in Voting Theory,"Voting is the aggregation of individual preferences in order to select a
winning alternative. Selection of a winner is accomplished via a voting rule,
e.g., rank-order voting, majority rule, plurality rule, approval voting. Which
voting rule should be used? In social choice theory, desirable properties of
voting rules are expressed as axioms to be satisfied. This thesis focuses on
axioms concerning strategic manipulation by voters. Sometimes, voters may
intentionally misstate their true preferences in order to alter the outcome for
their own advantage. For example, in plurality rule, if a voter knows that
their top-choice candidate will lose, then they might instead vote for their
second-choice candidate just to avoid an even less desirable result. When no
coalition of voters can strategically manipulate, then the voting rule is said
to satisfy the axiom of Strategy-Proofness. A less restrictive axiom is Weak
Strategy-Proofness (as defined by Dasgupta and Maskin (2019)), which allows for
strategic manipulation by all but the smallest coalitions. Under certain
intuitive conditions, Dasgupta and Maskin (2019) proved that the only voting
rules satisfying Strategy-Proofness are rank-order voting and majority rule. In
my thesis, I generalize their result, by proving that rank-order voting and
majority rule are surprisingly still the only voting rules satisfying Weak
Strategy-Proofness.",2005.07521v1,econ.TH,2020-05-13 19:53:08+00:00,[arxiv.Result.Author('Anne Carlstein')],

It is well known that the US electoral college system is about 5 times more
likely to have a changed outcome due to vote corruption, when compared to a
majority vote. In fact, Mossel, O'Donnell and Oleszkiewicz proved in 2005 that
the majority voting method is most stable to this random vote corruption, among
voting methods where each person has a small influence on the election. We
discuss some recent progress on the analogous result for elections between more
than two candidates. In this case, plurality should be most stable to
corruption in votes. We also survey results on adversarial election

in a non-random way), and we briefly discuss ranked choice voting methods

1522,Interpretable Factorization for Neural Network ECG Models,"The ability of deep learning (DL) to improve the practice of medicine and its
clinical outcomes faces a looming obstacle: model interpretation. Without
description of how outputs are generated, a collaborating physician can neither
resolve when the model's conclusions are in conflict with his or her own, nor
learn to anticipate model behavior. Current research aims to interpret networks
that diagnose ECG recordings, which has great potential impact as recordings
become more personalized and widely deployed. A generalizable impact beyond
ECGs lies in the ability to provide a rich test-bed for the development of
interpretive techniques in medicine. Interpretive techniques for Deep Neural
Networks (DNNs), however, tend to be heuristic and observational in nature,
lacking the mathematical rigor one might expect in the analysis of math
equations. The motivation of this paper is to offer a third option, a
scientific approach. We treat the model output itself as a phenomenon to be
explained through component parts and equations governing their behavior. We
argue that these component parts should also be ""black boxes"" --additional
targets to interpret heuristically with clear functional connection to the
original. We show how to rigorously factor a DNN into a hierarchical equation
consisting of black box variables. This is not a subdivision into physical
parts, like an organism into its cells; it is but one choice of an equation
into a collection of abstract functions. Yet, for DNNs trained to identify
normal ECG waveforms on PhysioNet 2017 Challenge data, we demonstrate this
choice yields interpretable component models identified with visual composite
sketches of ECG samples in corresponding input regions. Moreover, the recursion
distills this interpretation: additional factorization of component black boxes
corresponds to ECG partitions that are more morphologically pure.",2006.15189v1,cs.LG,2020-06-26 19:32:05+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Christopher Snyder'), arxiv.Result.Author('Sriram Vishwanath')]",

enabling them to detect when a model has made a mistake. We present a sequence
of pre-registered experiments (N=3,800) in which we showed participants
functionally identical models that varied only in two factors commonly thought
to make machine learning models more or less interpretable: the number of
features and the transparency of the model (i.e., whether the model internals
are clear or black box). Predictably, participants who saw a clear model with
few features could better simulate the model's predictions. However, we did not
find that participants more closely followed its predictions. Furthermore,
showing participants a clear model meant that they were less able to detect and
correct for the model's sizable mistakes, seemingly due to information
overload. These counterintuitive findings emphasize the importance of testing

hand, the radar signal can be diffracted when encountering raindrops or mist

state-of-the-art works reveal that fusion of radar and LiDAR can lead to robust
detection in adverse weather. The existing works adopt convolutional neural
network architecture to extract features from each sensor data stream, then
align and aggregate the two branch features to predict object detection
results. However, these methods have low accuracy of bounding box estimations

1534,Toward the Understanding of Deep Text Matching Models for Information Retrieval,"Semantic text matching is a critical problem in information retrieval.
Recently, deep learning techniques have been widely used in this area and
obtained significant performance improvements. However, most models are black
boxes and it is hard to understand what happened in the matching process, due
to the poor interpretability of deep learning. This paper aims at tackling this
problem. The key idea is to test whether existing deep text matching methods
satisfy some fundamental heuristics in information retrieval. Specifically,
four heuristics are used in our study, i.e., term frequency constraint, term
discrimination constraint, length normalization constraints, and TF-length
constraint. Since deep matching models usually contain many parameters, it is
difficult to conduct a theoretical study for these complicated functions. In
this paper, We propose an empirical testing method. Specifically, We first
construct some queries and documents to make them satisfy the assumption in a
constraint, and then test to which extend a deep text matching model trained on
the original dataset satisfies the corresponding constraint. Besides, a famous
attribution based interpretation method, namely integrated gradient, is adopted
to conduct detailed analysis and guide for feasible improvement. Experimental
results on LETOR 4.0 and MS Marco show that all the investigated deep text
matching methods, both representation and interaction based methods, satisfy
the above constraints with high probabilities in statistics. We further extend
these constraints to the semantic settings, which are shown to be better
satisfied for all the deep text matching models. These empirical findings give
clear understandings on why deep text matching models usually perform well in
information retrieval. We believe the proposed evaluation methodology will be
useful for testing future deep text matching models.",2108.07081v1,cs.IR,2021-08-16 13:33:15+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Lijuan Chen'), arxiv.Result.Author('Yanyan Lan'), arxiv.Result.Author('Liang Pang'), arxiv.Result.Author('Jiafeng Guo'), arxiv.Result.Author('Xueqi Cheng')]",
1535,Using Artificial Market Models to Forecast Financial Time-Series,"We discuss the theoretical machinery involved in predicting financial market
movements using an artificial market model which has been trained on real
financial data. This approach to market prediction - in particular, forecasting
financial time-series by training a third-party or 'black box' game on the
financial data itself -- was discussed by Johnson et al. in cond-mat/0105303
and cond-mat/0105258 and was based on some encouraging preliminary
investigations of the dollar-yen exchange rate, various individual stocks, and
stock market indices. However, the initial attempts lacked a clear formal
methodology. Here we present a detailed methodology, using optimization
techniques to build an estimate of the strategy distribution across the
multi-trader population. In contrast to earlier attempts, we are able to
present a systematic method for identifying 'pockets of predictability' in
real-world markets. We find that as each pocket closes up, the black-box system
needs to be 'reset' - which is equivalent to saying that the current
probability estimates of the strategy allocation across the multi-trader
population are no longer accurate. Instead, new probability estimates need to
be obtained by iterative updating, until a new 'pocket of predictability'
emerges and reliable prediction can resume.",physics/0506134v2,physics.soc-ph,2005-06-15 13:43:44+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Nachi Gupta'), arxiv.Result.Author('Raphael Hauser'), arxiv.Result.Author('Neil F. Johnson')]",
1536,Robustness and Transferability of Universal Attacks on Compressed Models,"Neural network compression methods like pruning and quantization are very
effective at efficiently deploying Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) on edge devices.
However, DNNs remain vulnerable to adversarial examples-inconspicuous inputs
that are specifically designed to fool these models. In particular, Universal
Adversarial Perturbations (UAPs), are a powerful class of adversarial attacks
which create adversarial perturbations that can generalize across a large set
of inputs. In this work, we analyze the effect of various compression
techniques to UAP attacks, including different forms of pruning and
quantization. We test the robustness of compressed models to white-box and
transfer attacks, comparing them with their uncompressed counterparts on
CIFAR-10 and SVHN datasets. Our evaluations reveal clear differences between
pruning methods, including Soft Filter and Post-training Pruning. We observe
that UAP transfer attacks between pruned and full models are limited,
suggesting that the systemic vulnerabilities across these models are different.
This finding has practical implications as using different compression
techniques can blunt the effectiveness of black-box transfer attacks. We show
that, in some scenarios, quantization can produce gradient-masking, giving a
false sense of security. Finally, our results suggest that conclusions about
the robustness of compressed models to UAP attacks is application dependent,
observing different phenomena in the two datasets used in our experiments.",2012.06024v1,cs.LG,2020-12-10 23:40:23+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Alberto G. Matachana'), arxiv.Result.Author('Kenneth T.

1537,Automated Isolation for White-box Test Generation,"Context. White-box test generation is a technique used for automatically
selecting test inputs using only the source or binary code. However, such
techniques encounter challenges when applying them to complex programs. One of
the main challenges is handling the dependencies of the unit under test.
  Objective. Without proper actions, generated tests cannot cover all parts of
the source code, or calling the dependencies may cause unexpected side effects
(e.g., file system or network access). These issues should be tackled while
maintaining the advantages of white-box test generation.
  Method. In this paper, we present an automated source code transformation
approach tackling the dependency issue for white-box test generation. This
technique isolates the test execution by creating a parameterized sandbox
wrapped around the transformed unit. We implemented the approach in a
ready-to-use tool using Microsoft Pex as a test generator, and evaluated it on
10 open-source projects from GitHub having more than 38.000 lines of code in
total.
  Results. The results from the evaluation indicate that if the lack of
isolation hinders white-box test generation, then our approach is able to help:
it increases the code coverage reached by the automatically generated test,
while it reduces unwanted side effects. Also, our results act as a unique
baseline for the test generation performance of Microsoft Pex on open-source
projects.
  Conclusion. Based on the results, our source code transformations might serve
well for alleviating the isolation problem in white-box test generation as it
increases the coverage reached in such situations, while maintaining the
practical applicability of the tests generated on the isolated code.",1910.02513v1,cs.SE,2019-10-06 20:10:13+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Dávid Honfi'), arxiv.Result.Author('Zoltán Micskei')]",Information and Software Technology (2020)

ground truth bounding boxes as clear as possible. However, we observe that
ambiguities are still introduced when labeling the bounding boxes. In this
paper, we propose a novel bounding box regression loss for learning bounding
box transformation and localization variance together. Our loss greatly
improves the localization accuracies of various architectures with nearly no
additional computation. The learned localization variance allows us to merge
neighboring bounding boxes during non-maximum suppression (NMS), which further
improves the localization performance. On MS-COCO, we boost the Average
Precision (AP) of VGG-16 Faster R-CNN from 23.6% to 29.1%. More importantly,
for ResNet-50-FPN Mask R-CNN, our method improves the AP and AP90 by 1.8% and
6.2% respectively, which significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art
bounding box refinement methods. Our code and models are available at:

verification of the black-box model. We present a method that can give a
guarantee of the absence of faults, i.e., the correctness of all test cases of
the black-box model. The black-model allows us to formulate a parametrized

1540,Making Code Voting Secure against Insider Threats using Unconditionally Secure MIX Schemes and Human PSMT Protocols,"Code voting was introduced by Chaum as a solution for using a possibly
infected-by-malware device to cast a vote in an electronic voting application.
Chaum's work on code voting assumed voting codes are physically delivered to
voters using the mail system, implicitly requiring to trust the mail system.
This is not necessarily a valid assumption to make - especially if the mail
system cannot be trusted. When conspiring with the recipient of the cast
ballots, privacy is broken.
  It is clear to the public that when it comes to privacy, computers and
""secure"" communication over the Internet cannot fully be trusted. This
emphasizes the importance of using: (1) Unconditional security for secure
network communication. (2) Reduce reliance on untrusted computers.
  In this paper we explore how to remove the mail system trust assumption in
code voting. We use PSMT protocols (SCN 2012) where with the help of visual
aids, humans can carry out $\mod 10$ addition correctly with a 99\% degree of
accuracy. We introduce an unconditionally secure MIX based on the combinatorics
of set systems.
  Given that end users of our proposed voting scheme construction are humans we
\emph{cannot use} classical Secure Multi Party Computation protocols.
  Our solutions are for both single and multi-seat elections achieving:
\begin{enumerate}[i)]
  \item An anonymous and perfectly secure communication network secure against
a $t$-bounded passive adversary used to deliver voting,
  \item The end step of the protocol can be handled by a human to evade the
threat of malware. \end{enumerate} We do not focus on active adversaries.",1506.04429v1,cs.CR,2015-06-14 19:07:51+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Yvo Desmedt'), arxiv.Result.Author('Stelios Erotokritou')]",

1542,Secure Remote Voting Using Paper Ballots,"Internet voting will probably be one of the most significant achievements of
the future information society. It will have an enormous impact on the election
process making it fast, reliable and inexpensive. Nonetheless, so far remote
voting is considered to be very difficult, as one has to take into account
susceptibility of the voter's PC to various cyber-attacks. As a result, most
the research effort is put into developing protocols and machines for poll-site
electronic voting. Although these solutions yield promising results, they
cannot be directly adopted to Internet voting because of secure platform
problem. However, the cryptographic components they utilize may be very useful.
This paper presents a scheme based on combination of mixnets and homomorphic
encryption borrowed from robust poll-site voting, along with techniques
recommended for remote voting -- code sheets and test ballots. The protocol
tries to minimize the trust put in voter's PC by making the voter responsible
for manual encryption of his vote. To achieve this, the voter obtains a paper
ballot that allows him to scramble the vote by performing simple operations
(lookup in a table). Creation of paper ballots, as well as decryption of votes,
is performed by a group of cooperating trusted servers. As a result, the scheme
is characterized by strong asymmetry -- all computations are carried out on the
server side. In consequence it does not require any additional hardware on the
voter's side, and offers distributed trust, receipt-freeness and verifiability.",0804.2349v1,cs.CR,2008-04-15 10:26:40+00:00,[arxiv.Result.Author('Lukasz Nitschke')],

segmentation based on the Generalized Hough transform. Pixels cast discretized,
probabilistic votes for the likely regions that contain instance centroids. At
the detected peaks that emerge in the voting heatmap, backprojection is applied
to collect pixels and produce instance masks. Unlike a sliding window detector
that densely enumerates object proposals, our method detects instances as a
result of the consensus among pixel-wise votes. We implement vote aggregation
and backprojection using native operators of a convolutional neural network.
The discretization of centroid voting reduces the training of instance
segmentation to pixel labeling, analogous and complementary to FCN-style
semantic segmentation, leading to an efficient and unified architecture that
jointly models things and stuff. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our
pipeline on COCO and Cityscapes Panoptic Segmentation and obtain competitive
results. Code will be open-sourced.",2004.01849v1,cs.CV,2020-04-04 04:33:45+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Haochen Wang'), arxiv.Result.Author('Ruotian Luo'), arxiv.Result.Author('Michael Maire'), arxiv.Result.Author('Greg Shakhnarovich')]",
1544,HoughNet: Integrating near and long-range evidence for bottom-up object detection,"This paper presents HoughNet, a one-stage, anchor-free, voting-based,
bottom-up object detection method. Inspired by the Generalized Hough Transform,
HoughNet determines the presence of an object at a certain location by the sum
of the votes cast on that location. Votes are collected from both near and
long-distance locations based on a log-polar vote field. Thanks to this voting
mechanism, HoughNet is able to integrate both near and long-range,
class-conditional evidence for visual recognition, thereby generalizing and
enhancing current object detection methodology, which typically relies on only
local evidence. On the COCO dataset, HoughNet's best model achieves 46.4 $AP$
(and 65.1 $AP_{50}$), performing on par with the state-of-the-art in bottom-up
object detection and outperforming most major one-stage and two-stage methods.
We further validate the effectiveness of our proposal in another task, namely,
""labels to photo"" image generation by integrating the voting module of HoughNet
to two different GAN models and showing that the accuracy is significantly
improved in both cases. Code is available at

1545,Back-tracing Representative Points for Voting-based 3D Object Detection in Point Clouds,"3D object detection in point clouds is a challenging vision task that
benefits various applications for understanding the 3D visual world. Lots of
recent research focuses on how to exploit end-to-end trainable Hough voting for
generating object proposals. However, the current voting strategy can only
receive partial votes from the surfaces of potential objects together with
severe outlier votes from the cluttered backgrounds, which hampers full
utilization of the information from the input point clouds. Inspired by the
back-tracing strategy in the conventional Hough voting methods, in this work,
we introduce a new 3D object detection method, named as Back-tracing
Representative Points Network (BRNet), which generatively back-traces the
representative points from the vote centers and also revisits complementary
seed points around these generated points, so as to better capture the fine
local structural features surrounding the potential objects from the raw point
clouds. Therefore, this bottom-up and then top-down strategy in our BRNet
enforces mutual consistency between the predicted vote centers and the raw
surface points and thus achieves more reliable and flexible object localization
and class prediction results. Our BRNet is simple but effective, which
significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on two large-scale point
cloud datasets, ScanNet V2 (+7.5% in terms of mAP@0.50) and SUN RGB-D (+4.7% in

are met.
  Voting systems are not restricted to politics, they are ensemble methods for
artificial intelligence, but the context of this article is natural
intelligence. It is important to find a system that is fair (e.g. freedom of
expression on the ballot exists), especially when the outcome of the voting
system has social impact: some voting systems have the unfair inevitability to
trend (over time) towards the same two major candidates (Duverger's law).",2110.07066v1,cs.AI,2021-10-13 22:34:49+00:00,[arxiv.Result.Author('Gabriel-Claudiu Grama')],
1547,Towards end-to-end verifiable online voting: adding verifiability to established voting systems,"Online voting for independent elections is generally supported by trusted
election providers. Typically these providers do not offer any way in which a
voter can verify their vote, so the providers are trusted with ballot privacy
and ensuring correctness. Despite the desire to offer online voting for
political elections, this lack of transparency and verifiability is often seen
as a significant barrier to the large-scale adoption of online elections.
Adding verifiability to an online election increases transparency and
integrity, allowing voters to verify that their vote has been recorded
correctly and included in the tally. However, replacing existing online systems
with those that provide verifiable voting requires new algorithms and code to
be deployed, and this presents a significant business risk to commercial
election providers. In this paper we present the first step in an incremental
approach which minimises the business risk but demonstrates the advantages of
verifiability, by developing an implementation of key elements of a
Selene-based verifiability layer and adding it to an operational online voting
system. Selene is a verifiable voting protocol that uses trackers to enable
voters to confirm that their votes have been captured correctly while
protecting voter anonymity. This results in a system where even the election
authority running the system cannot change the result in an undetectable way,
and gives stronger guarantees on the integrity of the election than were
previously present. We explore the challenges presented by adding a
verifiability layer to an operational system. We describe the results of two
initial trials, which obtained that survey respondents found this form of
verifiability easy to use and that they broadly appreciated it. We conclude by

consecutive layers. In the existing routing procedures, capsules produce
predictions (termed votes) for capsules of the next layer. In a nutshell, the

this paper, we propose non-iterative cluster routing for capsule networks. In
the proposed cluster routing, capsules produce vote clusters instead of
individual votes for next-layer capsules, and each vote cluster sends its
centroid to a next-layer capsule. Generally speaking, the next-layer capsule's
input is a weighted sum over the centroid of each vote cluster it receives. The
centroid that comes from a cluster with a smaller variance is assigned a larger
weight in the weighted sum process. Compared with the state-of-the-art capsule
networks, the proposed capsule networks achieve the best accuracy on the

1556,Vote from the Center: 6 DoF Pose Estimation in RGB-D Images by Radial Keypoint Voting,"We propose a novel keypoint voting scheme based on intersecting spheres, that
is more accurate than existing schemes and allows for fewer, more disperse
keypoints. The scheme is based upon the distance between points, which as a 1D
quantity can be regressed more accurately than the 2D and 3D vector and offset
quantities regressed in previous work, yielding more accurate keypoint
localization. The scheme forms the basis of the proposed RCVPose method for 6
DoF pose estimation of 3D objects in RGB-D data, which is particularly
effective at handling occlusions. A CNN is trained to estimate the distance
between the 3D point corresponding to the depth mode of each RGB pixel, and a
set of 3 disperse keypoints defined in the object frame. At inference, a sphere
centered at each 3D point is generated, of radius equal to this estimated
distance. The surfaces of these spheres vote to increment a 3D accumulator
space, the peaks of which indicate keypoint locations. The proposed radial
voting scheme is more accurate than previous vector or offset schemes, and is
robust to disperse keypoints. Experiments demonstrate RCVPose to be highly
accurate and competitive, achieving state-of-the-art results on the LINEMOD
99.7% and YCB-Video 97.2% datasets, notably scoring +4.9% higher 71.1% than

1561,Space-Efficient Gradual Typing in Coercion-Passing Style,"Herman et al. pointed out that the insertion of run-time checks into a
gradually typed program could hamper tail-call optimization and, as a result,
worsen the space complexity of the program. To address the problem, they
proposed a space-efficient coercion calculus, which was subsequently improved
by Siek et al. The semantics of these calculi involves eager composition of
run-time checks expressed by coercions to prevent the size of a term from
growing. However, it relies also on a nonstandard reduction rule, which does
not seem easy to implement. In fact, no compiler implementation of gradually
typed languages fully supports the space-efficient semantics faithfully.
  In this paper, we study coercion-passing style, which Herman et al. have
already mentioned, as a technique for straightforward space-efficient
implementation of gradually typed languages. A program in coercion-passing
style passes ""the rest of the run-time checks"" around---just like
continuation-passing style (CPS), in which ""the rest of the computation"" is
passed around---and (unlike CPS) composes coercions eagerly. We give a formal
coercion-passing translation from $\lambda$S by Siek et al. to $\lambda$S$_1$,
which is a new calculus of first-class coercions tailored for coercion-passing
style, and prove correctness of the translation. We also implement our
coercion-passing style transformation for the Grift compiler developed by
Kuhlenschmidt et al. An experimental result shows stack overflow can be

restricted in their scope and quite complex.
  In this paper, we therefore propose a new definition of coercion resistance
in a symbolic setting, based on an epistemic approach. Our definition is
relatively simple and intuitive. It allows for a fine-grained formulation of
coercion resistance and can be stated independently of a specific, symbolic
protocol and adversary model. As a proof of concept, we apply our definition to
three voting protocols. In particular, we carry out the first rigorous analysis
of the recently proposed Civitas system. We precisely identify those conditions

resistant. We also analyze protocols proposed by Lee et al. and Okamoto.",0903.0802v2,cs.CR,2009-03-04 16:49:00+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Ralf Kuesters'), arxiv.Result.Author('Tomasz Truderung')]",

coercers. We propose VoteAgain, a scalable voting scheme that relies on the

deterministic ballot padding mechanism to ensure that coercers cannot see
whether a vote has been replaced. This mechanism ensures tallies take
quasilinear time, making VoteAgain the first revoting scheme that can handle

even the most carefully designed systems necessarily leak information via the
announced result. In corner cases, this may be problematic. For example, if all
the votes go to one candidate then all vote privacy evaporates. The mere
possibility of candidates getting no or few votes could have implications for
security in practice: if a coercer demands that a voter cast a vote for such an
unpopular candidate, then the voter may feel obliged to obey, even if she is
confident that the voting system satisfies the standard coercion resistance
definitions. With complex ballots, there may also be a danger of ""Italian""
style (aka ""signature"") attacks: the coercer demands the voter cast a ballot
with a specific, identifying pattern. Here we propose an approach to tallying
end-to-end verifiable schemes that avoids revealing all the votes but still
achieves whatever confidence level in the announced result is desired. Now a
coerced voter can claim that the required vote must be amongst those that
remained shrouded. Our approach is based on the well-established notion of
Risk-Limiting Audits, but here applied to the tally rather than to the audit.
We show that this approach counters coercion threats arising in extreme tallies

voter registration scheme enabling voters to create verifiable and
indistinguishable real and fake credentials using an untrusted kiosk inside a
privacy booth at a supervised location, e.g., the registrar's office. TRIP
ensures the integrity of the voter's real credential while enabling the
creation of fake credentials using interactive zero-knowledge proofs between
the voter as the verifier and the kiosk as the prover, unbeknownst to the
average voter. TRIP ensures that even voters who are under extreme coercion,
and cannot leave the booth with a real credential, can delegate their vote to a
political party, with the caveat that they must then trust the kiosk. TRIP
optimizes the tallying process by limiting the number of credentials a voter
can receive and capping the number of votes that a credential can cast per
election. We conduct a preliminary usability study among 41 participants at a
university and found that 42.5% of participants rated TRIP a B or higher in

properties than simple types, e.g., ""is a natural"" instead of ""is an

  We show how to achieve sound space efficiency for manifest contracts with
strong predicate contracts. The essential trick is breaking the contract
checking down into coercions: structured, blame-annotated lists of checks. By
carefully preventing duplicate coercions from appearing, we can restore space
efficiency while keeping the same observable behavior.
  Along the way, we define a framework for space efficiency, traversing the
design space with three different space-efficient manifest calculi. We examine

implementing optimizations for Eff is overly error-prone because its core
language is implicitly-typed, making code transformations very fragile.
  To remedy this, we present an explicitly-typed polymorphic core calculus for
algebraic effect handlers with a subtyping-based type-and-effect system. It
reifies appeals to subtyping in explicit casts with coercions that witness the
subtyping proof, quickly exposing typing bugs in program transformations.
  Our typing-directed elaboration comes with a constraint-based inference
algorithm that turns an implicitly-typed Eff-like language into our calculus.
Moreover, all coercions and effect information can be erased in a

1575,Chill-Pass: Using Neuro-Physiological Responses to Chill Music to Defeat Coercion Attacks,"Current alphanumeric and biometric authentication systems cannot withstand
situations where a user is coerced into releasing their authentication
materials under hostile circumstances. Existing approaches of coercion
resistant authentication systems (CRAS) propose authentication factors such as
implicit learning tasks, which are non-transferable, but still have the
drawback that an attacker can force the victim (causing stress) to perform the
task in order to gain unauthorized access. Alternatively, there could be cases
where the user could claim that they were coerced into giving up the
authentication materials, whereas in reality they acted as an insider attacker.
Therefore, being able to detect stress during authentication also helps to
achieve non-repudiation in such cases. To address these concerns, we need CRAS
that have both the non-transferable property as well as a mechanism to detect
stress related to coercion. In this paper, we study the feasibility of using
Chill (intensely pleasurable) music as a stimulus to elicit unique
neuro-physiological responses that can be used as an authenticating factor for
CRAS. Chill music and stress are both stimuli for a neuro-chemical called
Dopamine. However, they release the Dopamine at different parts of the brain,
resulting in different neuro-physiological responses, which gives us both the
non-transferable and stress-detection properties necessary for CRAS. We have
experimentally validated our proposed Chill music based CRAS using human
subjects and measuring their neuro-physiological responses on our prototype
system. Based on the 100 samples collected from the subjects, we were able to
successfully authenticate the subjects with an accuracy of over 90\%. Our work

would hope that the performance in a gradually typed language would range
between that of a dynamically typed language and a statically typed language.
Existing implementations of gradually typed languages have not achieved this
goal due to overheads associated with runtime casts. Takikawa et al. (2016)
report up to 100$\times$ slowdowns for partially typed programs. In this paper
we present a compiler, named Grift, for evaluating implementation techniques
for gradual typing. We take a straightforward but surprisingly unexplored
implementation approach for gradual typing, that is, ahead-of-time compilation
to native assembly code with carefully chosen runtime representations and
space-efficient coercions.
  Our experiments show that this approach achieves performance on par with
OCaml on statically typed programs and performance between that of Gambit and
Racket on untyped programs. On partially typed code, the geometric mean ranges
from 0.42$\times$ to 2.36$\times$ that of (untyped) Racket across the
benchmarks. We implement casts using the coercions of Siek, Thiemann, and
Wadler (2015). This technique eliminates all catastrophic slowdowns without
introducing significant overhead. Across the benchmarks, coercions range from
15% slower (fft) to almost 2$\times$ faster (matmult) than regular casts. We
also implement the monotonic references of Siek et al. (2015). Monotonic
references eliminate all overhead in statically typed code, and for partially

1580,Sets of Half-Average Nulls Generate Risk-Limiting Audits: SHANGRLA,"Risk-limiting audits (RLAs) for many social choice functions can be reduced
to testing sets of null hypotheses of the form ""the average of this list is not
greater than 1/2"" for a collection of finite lists of nonnegative numbers. Such
social choice functions include majority, super-majority, plurality,
multi-winner plurality, Instant Runoff Voting (IRV), Borda count, approval
voting, and STAR-Voting, among others. The audit stops without a full hand
count iff all the null hypotheses are rejected. The nulls can be tested in many
ways. Ballot-polling is particularly simple; two new ballot-polling
risk-measuring functions for sampling without replacement are given.
Ballot-level comparison audits transform each null into an equivalent assertion
that the mean of re-scaled tabulation errors is not greater than 1/2. In turn,
that null can then be tested using the same statistical methods used for ballot
polling---but applied to different finite lists of nonnegative numbers.
SHANGRLA comparison audits are more efficient than previous comparison audits
for two reasons: (i) for most social choice functions, the conditions tested
are both necessary and sufficient for the reported outcome to be correct, while
previous methods tested conditions that were sufficient but not necessary, and
(ii) the tests avoid a conservative approximation. The SHANGRLA abstraction
simplifies stratified audits, including audits that combine ballot polling with
ballot-level comparisons, producing sharper audits than the ""SUITE"" approach.
SHANGRLA works with the ""phantoms to evil zombies"" strategy to treat missing
ballot cards and missing or redacted cast vote records. That also facilitates
sampling from ""ballot-style manifests,"" which can dramatically improve

trustworthy record of the votes), but can save labor when reported outcomes are
correct. This efficiency is eroded when sampling cannot be targeted to ballot
cards that contain the contest(s) under audit. If the sample is drawn from all
cast cards, RLA sample sizes scale like the reciprocal of the fraction of
ballot cards that contain the contest(s) under audit. That fraction shrinks as
the number of cards per ballot grows (i.e., when elections contain more
contests) and as the fraction of ballots that contain the contest decreases
(i.e., when a smaller percentage of voters are eligible to vote in the
contest). States that conduct RLAs of contests on multi-card ballots or of
small contests can dramatically reduce sample sizes by using information about
which ballot cards contain which contests -- by keeping track of card-style
data (CSD). For instance, CSD reduces the expected number of draws needed to
audit a single countywide contest on a 4-card ballot by 75%. Similarly, CSD
reduces the expected number of draws by 95% or more for an audit of two
contests with the same margin on a 4-card ballot if one contest is on every
ballot and the other is on 10% of ballots. In realistic examples, the savings
can be several orders of magnitude.",2012.03371v1,cs.CR,2020-12-06 20:35:12+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Amanda K. Glazer'), arxiv.Result.Author('Jacob V. Spertus'), arxiv.Result.Author('Philip B. Stark')]",

that one of the formulae is equal to a certain Kazhdan--Lusztig polynomial. For
a ballot tiling, we establish formulae which are analogues of formulae for Dyck
tilings. Especially, the generating functions have factorized expressions. The
key tool is a planted plane tree and its increasing labellings. We also
introduce a generalized perfect matching which is bijective to an Hermite
history for a ballot tiling. By combining these objects, we obtain various
expressions of a generating function of ballot tilings with a fixed lower path.",1705.06434v1,math-ph,2017-05-18 06:46:09+00:00,[arxiv.Result.Author('Keiichi Shigechi')],
1583,Non(c)esuch Ballot-Level Risk-Limiting Audits for Precinct-Count Voting Systems,"Risk-limiting audits (RLAs) guarantee a high probability of correcting
incorrect reported outcomes before the outcomes are certified. The most
efficient use ballot-level comparison, comparing the voting system's
interpretation of individual ballot cards sampled at random (cast-vote records,
CVRs) from a trustworthy paper trail to a human interpretation of the same
cards. Such comparisons require the voting system to create and export CVRs in
a way that can be linked to the individual ballots the CVRs purport to
represent. Such links can be created by keeping the ballots in the order in
which they are scanned or by printing a unique serial number on each ballot.
But for precinct-count systems (PCOS), these strategies may compromise vote
anonymity: the order in which ballots are cast may identify the voters who cast
them. Printing a unique pseudo-random number (""cryptographic nonce"") on each
ballot card after the voter last touches it could reduce such privacy risks.
But what if the system does not in fact print a unique number on each ballot or
does not accurately report the numbers it printed? This paper gives two ways to
conduct an RLA so that even if the system does not print a genuine nonce on
each ballot or misreports the nonces it used, the audit's risk limit is not
compromised (however, the anonymity of votes might be compromised). One method
allows untrusted technology to be used to imprint and to retrieve ballot cards.
The method is adaptive: if the technology behaves properly, this protection
does not increase the audit workload. But if the imprinting or retrieval system
misbehaves, the sample size the RLA requires to confirm the reported results
when the results are correct is generally larger than if the imprinting and
retrieval were accurate.",2207.01362v1,cs.CR,2022-07-04 12:35:42+00:00,[arxiv.Result.Author('Philip B. Stark')],

justifiably high confidence that the reported results of an election are
consistent with an audit trail (""ballots""), which can be paper or electronic.
SOBA combines three ideas: (1) publishing cast vote records (CVRs) separately
for each contest, so that anyone can verify that each reported contest outcome
is correct, if the CVRs reflect voters' intentions with sufficient accuracy;
(2) shrouding a mapping between ballots and the CVRs for those ballots to
prevent the loss of privacy that could occur otherwise; (3) assessing the
accuracy with which the CVRs reflect voters' intentions for a collection of
contests while simultaneously assessing the integrity of the shrouded mapping
between ballots and CVRs by comparing randomly selected ballots to the CVRs
that purport to represent them. Step (1) is related to work by the Humboldt
County Election Transparency Project, but publishing CVRs separately for
individual contests rather than images of entire ballots preserves privacy.
Step (2) requires a cryptographic commitment from elections officials.
Observers participate in step (3), which relies on the ""super-simple
simultaneous single-ballot risk-limiting audit."" Step (3) is designed to reveal
relatively few ballots if the shrouded mapping is proper and the CVRs
accurately reflect voter intent. But if the reported outcomes of the contests
differ from the outcomes that a full hand count would show, step (3) is
guaranteed to have a large chance of requiring all the ballots to be counted by
hand, thereby limiting the risk that an incorrect outcome will become official

polling and ballot-level comparisons have not been available.

ballot-level comparisons using stratified samples, and methods that combine
ballot-level comparison and variable-size batch comparison audits in a way that
does not require stratified sampling.

1586,Limiting Risk by Turning Manifest Phantoms into Evil Zombies,"Drawing a random sample of ballots to conduct a risk-limiting audit generally
requires knowing how the ballots cast in an election are organized into groups,
for instance, how many containers of ballots there are in all and how many
ballots are in each container. A list of the ballot group identifiers along
with number of ballots in each group is called a ballot manifest. What if the
ballot manifest is not accurate? Surprisingly, even if ballots are known to be
missing from the manifest, it is not necessary to make worst-case assumptions
about those ballots--for instance, to adjust the margin by the number of
missing ballots--to ensure that the audit remains conservative. Rather, it
suffices to make worst-case assumptions about the individual randomly selected
ballots that the audit cannot find. This observation provides a simple
modification to some risk-limiting audit procedures that makes them
automatically become more conservative if the ballot manifest has errors. The
modification--phantoms to evil zombies (~2EZ)--requires only an upper bound on
the total number of ballots cast. ~2EZ makes the audit P-value stochastically
larger than it would be had the manifest been accurate, automatically requiring
more than enough ballots to be audited to offset the manifest errors. This
ensures that the true risk limit remains smaller than the nominal risk limit.
On the other hand, if the manifest is in fact accurate and the upper bound on
the total number of ballots equals the total according to the manifest, ~2EZ
has no effect at all on the number of ballots audited nor on the true risk
limit.",1207.3413v1,stat.AP,2012-07-14 11:26:02+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Jorge H. Banuelos'), arxiv.Result.Author('Philip B. Stark')]",

printed ballot after making their selections on a Ballot Marking Device (BMD).
In this study, we altered votes on a voter's ballot after they had made their
selections on a BMD. We then required them to examine their ballots for any
changes from the slate they used to vote. Overall accuracy was exceptionally
high. Participants saw 1440 total contests, and of those 1440, there were a
total of 4 errors, so total accuracy was 99.8%. Participants were able to
perform with near-perfect accuracy regardless of ballot length, ballot type,
number of altered races, and location of altered races. Detection performance
was extremely robust. We conclude that with proper direction and resources,
voters can be near-perfect detectors of ballot changes on printed paper ballots
after voting with a BMD. This finding has significant implications for the
voting community as BMD use continues to grow. Research should now focus on
identifying administrative and behavioral methods that will prompt and
encourage voters to check their BMD-generated ballots before they drop them in

1590,Risk-Limiting Audits by Stratified Union-Intersection Tests of Elections (SUITE),"Risk-limiting audits (RLAs) offer a statistical guarantee: if a full manual
tally of the paper ballots would show that the reported election outcome is
wrong, an RLA has a known minimum chance of leading to a full manual tally.
RLAs generally rely on random samples. Stratified sampling--partitioning the
population of ballots into disjoint strata and sampling independently from the
strata--may simplify logistics or increase efficiency compared to simpler
sampling designs, but makes risk calculations harder. We present SUITE, a new
method for conducting RLAs using stratified samples. SUITE considers all
possible partitions of outcome-changing error across strata. For each
partition, it combines P-values from stratum-level tests into a combined
P-value; there is no restriction on the tests used in different strata. SUITE
maximizes the combined P-value over all partitions of outcome-changing error.
The audit can stop if that maximum is less than the risk limit. Voting systems
in some Colorado counties (comprising 98.2% of voters) allow auditors to check
how the system interpreted each ballot, which allows ballot-level comparison
RLAs. Other counties use ballot polling, which is less efficient. Extant
approaches to conducting an RLA of a statewide contest would require major
changes to Colorado's procedures and software, or would sacrifice the
efficiency of ballot-level comparison. SUITE does not. It divides ballots into
two strata: those cast in counties that can conduct ballot-level comparisons,
and the rest. Stratum-level P-values are found by methods derived here. The
resulting audit is substantially more efficient than statewide ballot polling.
SUITE is useful in any state with a mix of voting systems or that uses
stratified sampling for other reasons. We provide an open-source reference
implementation and exemplar calculations in Jupyter notebooks.",1809.04235v1,stat.AP,2018-09-12 02:56:22+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Kellie Ottoboni'), arxiv.Result.Author('Philip B. Stark'), arxiv.Result.Author('Mark Lindeman'), arxiv.Result.Author('Neal McBurnett')]",

malevolent adversary trying to buy real ballots. If the citizenry is divided
into subgroups (or districts), the adversary can construct a so-called ""Devil's
Menu"" consisting of several prices. In equilibrium, the adversary can buy the
real ballots of any strict subset of districts at a price corresponding to the
willingness to sell on the part of the citizens holding such ballots. By
contrast, decoy voters are trapped into selling their ballots at a low, or even
negligible, price. Blowing up the adversary's budget by introducing decoy
ballots may thus turn out to be futile. The Devil's Menu can also be applied to

initial exploration of boardroom elections with ballot privacy and voter
verifiability that use only ""low-tech cryptography"" without using computers to
mark or collect ballots. Specifically, we define the problem, introduce several
building blocks, and propose a new protocol that combines these blocks in novel
ways. Our new building blocks include ""foldable ballots"" that can be rotated to
hide the alignment of ballot choices with voting marks, and ""visual secrets""
that are easy to remember and use but hard to describe. Although closely seated
participants in a boardroom election have limited privacy, the protocol ensures
that no one can determine how others voted. Moreover, each voter can verify
that their ballot was correctly cast, collected, and counted, without being
able to prove how they voted, providing assurance against undue influence.
Low-tech cryptography is useful in situations where constituents do not trust
computer technology, and it avoids the complex auditing requirements of
end-to-end cryptographic voting systems such as Pr\^{e}t-\`{a}-Voter. This
paper's building blocks and protocol are meant to be a proof of concept that

actually cast their vote. So far, the combination of ballot stuffing and
participation privacy has been mostly studied for internet voting, where voters
are assumed to own trusted computing devices. Such approaches are inapplicable
to pollsite voting where voters typically vote bare handed. We present an
eligibility audit protocol to detect ballot stuffing in pollsite voting
protocols. This is done while protecting participation privacy from a remote
observer - one who does not physically observe voters during voting. Our
protocol can be instantiated as an additional layer on top of most existing
pollsite E2E-V voting protocols. To achieve our guarantees, we develop an
efficient zero-knowledge proof (ZKP), that, given a value $v$ and a set $\Phi$
of commitments, proves $v$ is committed by some commitment in $\Phi$, without
revealing which one. We call this a ZKP of reverse set membership because of
its relationship to the popular ZKPs of set membership. This ZKP may be of
independent interest.",2210.14833v1,cs.CR,2022-10-26 16:29:23+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Prashant Agrawal'), arxiv.Result.Author('Abhinav Nakarmi'), arxiv.Result.Author('Mahabir Prasad Jhanwar'), arxiv.Result.Author('Subodh Sharma'), arxiv.Result.Author('Subhashis Banerjee')]",
1594,The ATHENA Class of Risk-Limiting Ballot Polling Audits,"The main risk-limiting ballot polling audit in use today, BRAVO, is designed
for use when single ballots are drawn at random and a decision regarding
whether to stop the audit or draw another ballot is taken after each ballot
draw (ballot-by-ballot (B2) audits). On the other hand, real ballot polling
audits draw many ballots in a single round before determining whether to stop
(round-by-round (R2) audits). We show that BRAVO results in significant
inefficiency when directly applied to real R2 audits. We present the ATHENA
class of R2 stopping rules, which we show are risk-limiting if the round
schedule is pre-determined (before the audit begins). We prove that each rule
is at least as efficient as the corresponding BRAVO stopping rule applied at
the end of the round. We have open-source software libraries implementing most
of our results.
  We show that ATHENA halves the number of ballots required, for all state
margins in the 2016 US Presidential election and a first round with $90\%$
stopping probability, when compared to BRAVO (stopping rule applied at the end
of the round). We present simulation results supporting the 90% stopping
probability claims and our claims for the risk accrued in the first round.
Further, ATHENA reduces the number of ballots by more than a quarter for low
margins, when compared to the BRAVO stopping rule applied on ballots in
selection order. This implies that keeping track of the order when drawing
ballots R2 is not beneficial, because ATHENA is more efficient even without
information on selection order. These results are significant because current
approaches to real ballot polling election audits use the B2 BRAVO rules,
requiring about twice as much work on the part of election officials. Applying
the rules in selection order requires fewer ballots, but keeping track of the
order, and entering it into audit software, adds to the effort.",2008.02315v5,cs.CR,2020-08-05 18:47:37+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Filip Zagórski'), arxiv.Result.Author('Grant McClearn'), arxiv.Result.Author('Sarah Morin'), arxiv.Result.Author('Neal McBurnett'), arxiv.Result.Author('Poorvi L.

not require identification numbers on the ballots or counting many ballots per

simply choose not to attempt verification in the first place. In order to
understand this problem, we conducted an experiment in which 108 participants

Equally, we discard any hypothesis that implies altering some machines and not
others, at each electoral precinct, because the variation patterns between
machines at each precinct are normal. However, the statistical evidence is
compatible with the occurrence of fraud that has affected every machine in a
single precinct, but differentially more in some precincts than others. We find
that the deviation pattern between precincts, based on the relationship between
the signatures collected to request the referendum in November 2003 (the
so-called, Reafirmazo), and the YES votes on August 15, is positive and
significantly correlated with the deviation pattern in the relationship between

1602,Conservative statistical post-election audits,"There are many sources of error in counting votes: the apparent winner might
not be the rightful winner. Hand tallies of the votes in a random sample of
precincts can be used to test the hypothesis that a full manual recount would
find a different outcome. This paper develops a conservative sequential test
based on the vote-counting errors found in a hand tally of a simple or
stratified random sample of precincts. The procedure includes a natural
escalation: If the hypothesis that the apparent outcome is incorrect is not
rejected at stage $s$, more precincts are audited. Eventually, either the
hypothesis is rejected--and the apparent outcome is confirmed--or all precincts
have been audited and the true outcome is known. The test uses a priori bounds
on the overstatement of the margin that could result from error in each
precinct. Such bounds can be derived from the reported counts in each precinct
and upper bounds on the number of votes cast in each precinct. The test allows
errors in different precincts to be treated differently to reflect voting
technology or precinct sizes. It is not optimal, but it is conservative: the
chance of erroneously confirming the outcome of a contest if a full manual
recount would show a different outcome is no larger than the nominal
significance level. The approach also gives a conservative $P$-value for the
hypothesis that a full manual recount would find a different outcome, given the
errors found in a fixed size sample. This is illustrated with two contests from

necessary part of some areas of quantitative inference, including in United
States voting rights litigation. Ecological inference suffers from a lack of
identification that, most agree, is best addressed by incorporating
individual-level data into the model. In this paper we test the limits of such
an incorporation by attempting it in the context of drawing inferences about
racial voting patterns using a combination of an exit poll and precinct-level
ecological data; accurate information about racial voting patterns is needed to
assess triggers in voting rights laws that can determine the composition of
United States legislative bodies. Specifically, we extend and study a hybrid
model that addresses two-way tables of arbitrary dimension. We apply the hybrid
model to an exit poll we administered in the City of Boston in 2008. Using the
resulting data as well as simulation, we compare the performance of a pure
ecological estimator, pure survey estimators using various sampling schemes and
our hybrid. We conclude that the hybrid estimator offers substantial benefits

practices in New York City (NYC) using geographic regression discontinuity
designs (GeoRDDs). By focusing on small geographic windows near police precinct
boundaries we can estimate local average treatment effects of precincts on
arrest rates. The standard GeoRDD relies on continuity assumptions of the
potential outcome surface or a local randomization assumption within a window
around the boundary. These assumptions, however, can easily be violated in
realistic applications. We develop a novel and robust approach to testing
whether there are differences in policing outcomes that are caused by
differences in police precincts across NYC. In particular, our test is robust
to violations of the assumptions traditionally made in GeoRDDs and is valid
under much weaker assumptions. We use a unique form of resampling to identify
new geographic boundaries that are known to have no treatment effect, which
provides a valid estimate of our test statistic's null distribution even under
violations of standard assumptions. This procedure gives substantially
different results in the analysis of NYC arrest rates than those that rely on
standard assumptions, thereby providing more robust tests of the effect of
police precincts on arrest rates in NYC.",2106.16124v3,stat.ME,2021-06-30 15:20:46+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Emmett B. Kendall'), arxiv.Result.Author('Brenden Beck'), arxiv.Result.Author('Joseph Antonelli')]",
1607,Mathematically Quantifying Non-responsiveness of the 2021 Georgia Congressional Districting Plan,"To audit political district maps for partisan gerrymandering, one may
determine a baseline for the expected distribution of partisan outcomes by
sampling an ensemble of maps. One approach to sampling is to use redistricting
policy as a guide to precisely codify preferences between maps. Such
preferences give rise to a probability distribution on the space of
redistricting plans, and Metropolis-Hastings methods allow one to sample
ensembles of maps from the specified distribution. Although these approaches
have nice theoretical properties and have successfully detected gerrymandering
in legal settings, sampling from commonly-used policy-driven distributions is
often computationally difficult. As of yet, there is no algorithm that can be
used off-the-shelf for checking maps under generic redistricting criteria. In
this work, we mitigate the computational challenges in a Metropolized-sampling
technique through a parallel tempering method combined with ReCom[12] and, for
the first time, validate that such techniques are effective on these problems
at the scale of statewide precinct graphs for more policy informed measures. We
develop these improvements through the first case study of district plans in
Georgia. Our analysis projects that any election in Georgia will reliably elect
9 Republicans and 5 Democrats under the enacted plan. This result is largely
fixed even as public opinion shifts toward either party and the partisan
outcome of the enacted plan does not respond to the will of the people. Only

Vietoris--Rips or other distance-based simplicial complexes on point clouds
because they are relatively easy to compute. We investigate alternative methods
of constructing these complexes and the effects of making associated choices
during simplicial-complex construction on the output of persistent-homology
algorithms. We present two new methods for constructing simplicial complexes
from two-dimensional geospatial data (such as maps). We apply these methods to
a California precinct-level voting data set, demonstrating that our new
constructions can capture geometric characteristics that are missed by
distance-based constructions. Our new constructions can thus yield more
interpretable persistence modules and barcodes for geospatial data. In
particular, they are able to distinguish short-persistence features that occur
only for a narrow range of distance scales (e.g., voting behaviors in densely
populated cities) from short-persistence noise by incorporating information

1609,Asymmetry in Political Geography and Compactness in Districting: a Computational Analysis of Bias,"We investigate the distribution of partisanship in a cross-section of ten
diverse States to elucidate how votes translate into seats won and other
metrics. Markov chain simulations taking into account partisanship distribution
agree surprisingly well with a simple model covering only equal voting
population-weighted distributions of precinct results containing no spatial
information. We find asymmetries where Democrats win fewer precincts than
Republicans but do so with large marjorities. This skew accounts for persistent
Republican control of State Legislatures and Congressional seats even in some
states with statewide vote majorities for Democrats.
  Despite overall results showing Republican advantages in many states based on
mean results from simulations covering many random scenarios, the simulations
yield a wide range in metrics, suggesting bias can be minimized better by
selecting districting plans with low values for efficiency gap than by
selecting plans with values near the means for the ensemble of random
simulations.
  We examine constraints on county splits to achieve higher compactness and
investigate policies requiring cohesiveness for communities of interest as to
screen out the most obvious gerrymanders. Minimizing county splits does not
necessarily reduce partisan bias, except for Pennsylvania, where limiting

1612,"Bipartisanship breakdown, functional networks and forensic analysis in Spanish 2015 and 2016 national elections","In this paper we present a social network and forensic analysis of the vote
counts of Spanish national elections that took place in December 2015 and their
sequel in June 2016. Vote counts are extracted at the level of municipalities,
yielding an unusually high resolution dataset with over 8000 samples. We
initially consider the phenomenon of Bipartisanship breakdown by analysing
spatial distributions of several Bipartisanship indices. We find that such
breakdown is more prominent close to cosmopolite and largely populated areas
and less important in rural areas where Bipartisanship still prevails, and its
evolution mildly consolidates in the 2016 round, with some evidence of
Bipartisanship reinforcement which we hypothesize to be due to psychological
mechanisms of risk aversion. On a third step we explore to which extent vote
data are faithful by applying forensic techniques to vote statistics. We first
explore the conformance of first digit distributions to Benford's law for each
of the main political parties. The results and interpretations are mixed and
vary across different levels of aggregation, finding a general good
quantitative agreement at the national scale for both municipalities and
precincts but finding systematic nonconformance at the level of individual
precincts. As a complementary metric, we further explore the co-occurring
statistics of voteshare and turnout, finding a mild tendency in the clusters of
the conservative party to smear out towards the area of high turnout and
voteshare, what has been previously interpreted as a possible sign of
incremental fraud. In every case results are qualitatively similar between 2015

1614,Using Deep Learning and Google Street View to Estimate the Demographic Makeup of the US,"The United States spends more than $1B each year on initiatives such as the
American Community Survey (ACS), a labor-intensive door-to-door study that
measures statistics relating to race, gender, education, occupation,
unemployment, and other demographic factors. Although a comprehensive source of
data, the lag between demographic changes and their appearance in the ACS can
exceed half a decade. As digital imagery becomes ubiquitous and machine vision
techniques improve, automated data analysis may provide a cheaper and faster
alternative. Here, we present a method that determines socioeconomic trends
from 50 million images of street scenes, gathered in 200 American cities by
Google Street View cars. Using deep learning-based computer vision techniques,
we determined the make, model, and year of all motor vehicles encountered in
particular neighborhoods. Data from this census of motor vehicles, which
enumerated 22M automobiles in total (8% of all automobiles in the US), was used
to accurately estimate income, race, education, and voting patterns, with
single-precinct resolution. (The average US precinct contains approximately
1000 people.) The resulting associations are surprisingly simple and powerful.
For instance, if the number of sedans encountered during a 15-minute drive
through a city is higher than the number of pickup trucks, the city is likely
to vote for a Democrat during the next Presidential election (88% chance);
otherwise, it is likely to vote Republican (82%). Our results suggest that

1615,Non(c)esuch Ballot-Level Risk-Limiting Audits for Precinct-Count Voting Systems,"Risk-limiting audits (RLAs) guarantee a high probability of correcting
incorrect reported outcomes before the outcomes are certified. The most
efficient use ballot-level comparison, comparing the voting system's
interpretation of individual ballot cards sampled at random (cast-vote records,
CVRs) from a trustworthy paper trail to a human interpretation of the same
cards. Such comparisons require the voting system to create and export CVRs in
a way that can be linked to the individual ballots the CVRs purport to
represent. Such links can be created by keeping the ballots in the order in
which they are scanned or by printing a unique serial number on each ballot.
But for precinct-count systems (PCOS), these strategies may compromise vote
anonymity: the order in which ballots are cast may identify the voters who cast
them. Printing a unique pseudo-random number (""cryptographic nonce"") on each
ballot card after the voter last touches it could reduce such privacy risks.
But what if the system does not in fact print a unique number on each ballot or
does not accurately report the numbers it printed? This paper gives two ways to
conduct an RLA so that even if the system does not print a genuine nonce on
each ballot or misreports the nonces it used, the audit's risk limit is not
compromised (however, the anonymity of votes might be compromised). One method
allows untrusted technology to be used to imprint and to retrieve ballot cards.
The method is adaptive: if the technology behaves properly, this protection
does not increase the audit workload. But if the imprinting or retrieval system
misbehaves, the sample size the RLA requires to confirm the reported results
when the results are correct is generally larger than if the imprinting and
retrieval were accurate.",2207.01362v1,cs.CR,2022-07-04 12:35:42+00:00,[arxiv.Result.Author('Philip B. Stark')],

rates using state-level statistics from the USA. We found that the correlates

1621,Software Variants for Hardware Trojan Detection and Resilience in COTS Processors,"The commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) component based ecosystem provides an
attractive system design paradigm due to the drastic reduction in development

concern of trustworthiness arising from the possibility of embedded malicious

approaches are typically not applicable to COTS hardware due to the absence of
golden models and the lack of observability of internal signals. In this work,
we propose a novel approach for runtime Trojan detection and resilience in
untrusted COTS processors through judicious modifications in software. The
proposed approach does not rely on any hardware redundancy or architectural
modification and hence seamlessly integrates with the COTS-based system design
process. Trojan resilience is achieved through the execution of multiple
functionally equivalent software variants. We have developed and implemented a
solution for compiler-based automatic generation of program variants,
metric-guided selection of variants, and their integration in a single
executable. To evaluate the proposed approach, we first analyzed the
effectiveness of program variants in avoiding the activation of a random pool
of Trojans. By implementing several Trojans in an OpenRISC 1000 processor, we
analyzed the detectability and resilience during Trojan activation in both

1626,Development of COTS ADC SEE Test System for the ATLAS LAr Calorimeter Upgrade,"Radiation-tolerant, high speed, high density and low power commercial
off-the-shelf (COTS) analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) are planned to be used
in the upgrade to the Liquid Argon (LAr) calorimeter front end (FE) trigger
readout electronics. Total ionization dose (TID) and single event effect (SEE)
are two important radiation effects which need to be characterized on COTS
ADCs. In our initial TID test, Texas Instruments (TI) ADS5272 was identified to
be the top performer after screening a total 17 COTS ADCs from different
manufacturers with dynamic range and sampling rate meeting the requirements of
the FE electronics. Another interesting feature of ADS5272 is its 6.5 clock
cycles latency, which is the shortest among the 17 candidates. Based on the TID
performance, we have designed a SEE evaluation system for ADS5272, which allows
us to further assess its radiation tolerance. In this paper, we present a
detailed design of ADS5272 SEE evaluation system and show the effectiveness of
this system while evaluating ADS5272 SEE characteristics in multiple
irradiation tests. According to TID and SEE test results, ADS5272 was chosen to
be implemented in the full-size LAr Trigger Digitizer Board (LTDB)

1627,Experimental Performance Evaluation of Cell-free Massive MIMO Systems Using COTS RRU with OTA Reciprocity Calibration and Phase Synchronization,"Downlink coherent multiuser transmission is an essential technique for
cell-free massive multiple-input multiple output (MIMO) systems, and the
availability of channel state information (CSI) at the transmitter is a basic
requirement. To avoid CSI feedback in a time-division duplex system, the uplink
channel parameters should be calibrated to obtain the downlink CSI due to the
radio frequency circuit mismatch of the transceiver. In this paper, a design of
a reference signal for over-the-air reciprocity calibration is proposed. The
frequency domain generated reference signals can make full use of the flexible
frame structure of the fifth generation (5G) new radio, which can be completely
transparent to commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) remote radio units (RRUs) and
commercial user equipments. To further obtain the calibration of multiple RRUs,
an interleaved RRU grouping with a genetic algorithm is proposed, and an
averaged Argos calibration algorithm is also presented. We develop a cell-free
massive MIMO prototype system with COTS RRUs, demonstrate the statistical
characteristics of the calibration error and the effectiveness of the
calibration algorithm, and evaluate the impact of the calibration delay on the
different cooperative transmission schemes.",2208.14048v1,cs.IT,2022-08-30 08:05:05+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Yang Cao'), arxiv.Result.Author('Pan Wang'), arxiv.Result.Author('Kang Zheng'), arxiv.Result.Author('Xianghu Liang'), arxiv.Result.Author('Dongjie Liu'), arxiv.Result.Author('Mengting Lou'), arxiv.Result.Author('Jing Jin'), arxiv.Result.Author('Qixing Wang'), arxiv.Result.Author('Dongming Wang'), arxiv.Result.Author('Yongming Huang'), arxiv.Result.Author('Xiaohu You'), arxiv.Result.Author('Jiangzhou Wang')]",
1628,Real-time Interference Identification via Supervised Learning: Embedding Coexistence Awareness in IoT Devices,"Energy sampling-based interference detection and identification (IDI) methods
collide with the limitations of commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) IoT hardware.
Moreover, long sensing times, complexity and inability to track concurrent
interference strongly inhibit their applicability in most IoT deployments.
Motivated by the increasing need for on-device IDI for wireless coexistence, we
develop a lightweight and efficient method targeting interference
identification already at the level of single interference bursts. Our method
exploits real-time extraction of envelope and model-aided spectral features,
specifically designed considering the physical properties of signals captured
with COTS hardware. We adopt manifold supervised-learning (SL) classifiers
ensuring suitable performance and complexity trade-off for IoT platforms with
different computational capabilities. The proposed IDI method is capable of
real-time identification of IEEE 802.11b/g/n, 802.15.4, 802.15.1 and Bluetooth
Low Energy wireless standards, enabling isolation and extraction of
standard-specific traffic statistics even in the case of heavy concurrent
interference. We perform an experimental study in real environments with
heterogeneous interference scenarios, showing 90%-97% burst identification

1629,Analog On-Tag Hashing: Towards Selective Reading as Hash Primitives in Gen2 RFID Systems,"Deployment of billions of Commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) RFID tags has drawn
much of the attention of the research community because of the performance gaps
of current systems. In particular, hash-enabled protocol (HEP) is one of the
most thoroughly studied topics in the past decade. HEPs are designed for a wide
spectrum of notable applications (e.g., missing detection) without need to
collect all tags. HEPs assume that each tag contains a hash function, such that
a tag can select a random but predicable time slot to reply with a one-bit
presence signal that shows its existence. However, the hash function has never
been implemented in COTS tags in reality, which makes HEPs a 10-year
untouchable mirage. This work designs and implements a group of analog on-tag
hash primitives (called Tash) for COTS Gen2-compatible RFID systems, which
moves prior HEPs forward from theory to practice. In particular, we design
three types of hash primitives, namely, tash function, tash table function and
tash operator. All of these hash primitives are implemented through selective
reading, which is a fundamental and mandatory functionality specified in Gen2
protocol, without any hardware modification and fabrication. We further apply
our hash primitives in two typical HEP applications (i.e., cardinality
estimation and missing detection) to show the feasibility and effectiveness of
Tash. Results from our prototype, which is composed of one ImpinJ reader and 3,
000 Alien tags, demonstrate that the new design lowers 60% of the communication
overhead in the air. The tash operator can additionally introduce an overhead
drop of 29.7%.",1707.08883v1,cs.NI,2017-07-27 14:31:44+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Lei Yang'), arxiv.Result.Author('Qiongzheng Lin'), arxiv.Result.Author('Chunhui Duan'), arxiv.Result.Author('Zhenlin An')]",
1630,A Touch of Evil: High-Assurance Cryptographic Hardware from Untrusted Components,"The semiconductor industry is fully globalized and integrated circuits (ICs)
are commonly defined, designed and fabricated in different premises across the
world. This reduces production costs, but also exposes ICs to supply chain
attacks, where insiders introduce malicious circuitry into the final products.
Additionally, despite extensive post-fabrication testing, it is not uncommon
for ICs with subtle fabrication errors to make it into production systems.
While many systems may be able to tolerate a few byzantine components, this is
not the case for cryptographic hardware, storing and computing on confidential
data. For this reason, many error and backdoor detection techniques have been
proposed over the years. So far all attempts have been either quickly
circumvented, or come with unrealistically high manufacturing costs and
complexity.
  This paper proposes Myst, a practical high-assurance architecture, that uses
commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) hardware, and provides strong security
guarantees, even in the presence of multiple malicious or faulty components.
The key idea is to combine protective-redundancy with modern threshold
cryptographic techniques to build a system tolerant to hardware trojans and
errors. To evaluate our design, we build a Hardware Security Module that
provides the highest level of assurance possible with COTS components.
Specifically, we employ more than a hundred COTS secure crypto-coprocessors,
verified to FIPS140-2 Level 4 tamper-resistance standards, and use them to
realize high-confidentiality random number generation, key derivation, public
key decryption and signing. Our experiments show a reasonable computational
overhead (less than 1% for both Decryption and Signing) and an exponential

uncertainty of potential software induced failures. Moreover, the lack of
information regarding security vulnerabilities increases the risks of their
usage, since their exploitation might lead to undesired behaviour of the

functions (VNFs) into a forwarding graph (FG) at the logical layer and the
embedding of the FG on the servers need to take into account the
less-than-carrier-grade reliability of COTS components. This work investigates
the trade-off between end-to-end reliability and computational load per server
via the joint design of VNF chain composition (CC) and FG embedding (FGE) under
the assumption of a bipartite FG that consists of controller and regular VNFs.
Evaluating the reliability criterion within a probabilistic model, analytical
insights are first provided for a simplified disconnected FG. Then, a block
coordinate descent method based on mixed-integer linear programming is proposed
to tackle the joint optimization of CC and FGE. Via simulation results, it is
observed that a joint design of CC and FGE leads to substantial performance
gains compared to separate optimization approaches.",1704.06864v1,cs.IT,2017-04-23 00:40:17+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Jinkyu Kang'), arxiv.Result.Author('Osvaldo Simeone'), arxiv.Result.Author('Joonhyuk Kang')]",

numerous applications in quantum algebra. Considered as iterated integrals they
become periods of the motivic fundamental groupoid of
$\mathbb{P}^1\setminus\{0,1,\infty\}$. From there comes a fundamental, yet no
more explicit, system of algebraic relations; it implies the system of
associators.
  We focus here on the combinatorics properties of another system of relations,
the ``double shuffles'', which comes from elementary series and integrals
manipulations. We show that it shares a torsor property with associators and
``motivic'' relations, is implied by the latter and defines a polynomial
algebra over $\mathbb{Q}$ (a result first due to J. Ecalle). We obtain these
results for more general numbers: values of Goncharov's multiple polylogarithms
at roots of unity.

1648,Making Responsible AI the Norm rather than the Exception,"This report prepared by the Montreal AI Ethics Institute provides
recommendations in response to the National Security Commission on Artificial
Intelligence (NSCAI) Key Considerations for Responsible Development and
Fielding of Artificial Intelligence document. The report centres on the idea
that Responsible AI should be made the Norm rather than an Exception. It does
so by utilizing the guiding principles of: (1) alleviating friction in existing
workflows, (2) empowering stakeholders to get buy-in, and (3) conducting an
effective translation of abstract standards into actionable engineering
practices. After providing some overarching comments on the document from the
NSCAI, the report dives into the primary contribution of an actionable
framework to help operationalize the ideas presented in the document from the
NSCAI. The framework consists of: (1) a learning, knowledge, and information
exchange (LKIE), (2) the Three Ways of Responsible AI, (3) an
empirically-driven risk-prioritization matrix, and (4) achieving the right
level of complexity. All components reinforce each other to move from
principles to practice in service of making Responsible AI the norm rather than
the exception.",2101.11832v2,cs.CY,2021-01-28 06:39:01+00:00,[arxiv.Result.Author('Abhishek Gupta')],

many mega-science astronomical projects, for example CTA, DESI, EUCLID, FAST,
GAIA, JWST, LAMOST, LSST, SDSS, SKA, and large scale simulations, astronomy has
become a Big Data science. Astronomical data is not only necessary resource for
scientific research, but also very valuable resource for education and public
outreach (EPO), especially in the era of Internet and Cloud Computing. IAU WG
Data-driven Astronomy Education and Public Outreach is hosted at the IAU
Division B (Facilities, Technologies and Data Science) Commission B2 (Data and
Documentation), and organized jointly with Commission C1 (Astronomy Education
and Development), Commission C2 (Communicating Astronomy with the Public),
Office of Astronomy for Development (OAD), Office for Astronomy Outreach (OAO)
and several other non IAU communities, including IVOA Education Interest Group,
American Astronomical Society Worldwide Telescope Advisory Board, Zooniverse

1652,FETILDA: An Effective Framework For Fin-tuned Embeddings For Long Financial Text Documents,"Unstructured data, especially text, continues to grow rapidly in various
domains. In particular, in the financial sphere, there is a wealth of
accumulated unstructured financial data, such as the textual disclosure
documents that companies submit on a regular basis to regulatory agencies, such
as the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). These documents are typically
very long and tend to contain valuable soft information about a company's
performance. It is therefore of great interest to learn predictive models from
these long textual documents, especially for forecasting numerical key
performance indicators (KPIs). Whereas there has been a great progress in
pre-trained language models (LMs) that learn from tremendously large corpora of
textual data, they still struggle in terms of effective representations for
long documents. Our work fills this critical need, namely how to develop better
models to extract useful information from long textual documents and learn
effective features that can leverage the soft financial and risk information
for text regression (prediction) tasks. In this paper, we propose and implement
a deep learning framework that splits long documents into chunks and utilizes
pre-trained LMs to process and aggregate the chunks into vector
representations, followed by self-attention to extract valuable document-level
features. We evaluate our model on a collection of 10-K public disclosure
reports from US banks, and another dataset of reports submitted by US
companies. Overall, our framework outperforms strong baseline methods for
textual modeling as well as a baseline regression model using only numerical
data. Our work provides better insights into how utilizing pre-trained
domain-specific and fine-tuned long-input LMs in representing long documents
can improve the quality of representation of textual data, and therefore, help
in improving predictive analyses.",2206.06952v1,cs.CL,2022-06-14 16:14:14+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Bolun ""Namir"" Xia'), arxiv.Result.Author('Vipula D. Rawte'), arxiv.Result.Author('Mohammed J. Zaki'), arxiv.Result.Author('Aparna Gupta')]",
1653,The Future of Integrated Digital Governance in the EU: EBSI and GLASS,"In the past, citizen identity has been used within siloed data areas, and
where government agencies have linked citizens across different services. Often
these identifiers were simple alphanumeric strings, and which were assigned by
government agencies. These identifiers are then linked in some way to the
citizen, and where citizens often have to request access to documents that
prove certain aspects of their citizenship. These systems, too, often use
paper-based approaches and have little in the way of real digital trust. But,
in an information age, we now have the ability to provide unique digital
identifiers for each citizen, and then for them to claim access to their
citizenship documents. This might be in the form of their academic
qualifications, their tax status, or even their driver's licence. While, at one
time, these documents were either held by the trusted issuers of the
information, or in a paper form, we now have the opportunity for these
documents to be linked to a citizen wallet. This would allow citizens the
opportunity to request documents once, but use them many times. A core part of
this is the unique private key associated with the citizen, and in the usage of
digital signing by trusted entities. While many countries have struggled to
implement a digital identity scheme, the EU Commission has the ambition to
provide every EU citizen with a digital wallet, and thus moved towards improved
freedom of movement and integration of the countries within the EU. The scale
of this cannot be underestimated, and it could break down the barriers that
have been created by legacy systems. In order to harmonise the integration of
both citizens and trusted signers, the EU Commission proposes the usage of EBSI
(European Blockchain Services Infrastructure).",2212.03218v1,cs.CR,2022-12-06 18:38:36+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('William J Buchanan'), arxiv.Result.Author('Mwarwan Abubakar'), arxiv.Result.Author('Owen Lo'), arxiv.Result.Author('Christos Chrysoulas'), arxiv.Result.Author('Nikolaos Pitropakis'), arxiv.Result.Author('Pavlos Papadopoulos'), arxiv.Result.Author('Sarwar Sayeed'), arxiv.Result.Author('Marc Sel')]",

annotates the texts with the generated meta-information and stores the
meta-information in a database. The system then generates a zoomable and

1664,Identifying Possible Winners in Ranked Choice Voting Elections with Outstanding Ballots,"Several election districts in the US have recently moved to ranked-choice
voting (RCV) to decide the results of local elections. RCV allows voters to
rank their choices, and the results are computed in rounds, eliminating one
candidate at a time. RCV ensures fairer elections and has been shown to
increase elected representation of women and people of color. A main drawback
of RCV is that the round-by-round process requires all the ballots to be
tallied before the results of an election can be calculated. With increasingly
large portions of ballots coming from absentee voters, RCV election outcomes
are not always apparent on election night, and can take several weeks to be
published, leading to a loss of trust in the electoral process from the public.
In this paper, we present an algorithm for efficiently computing possible
winners of RCV elections from partially known ballots and evaluate it on data
from the recent New York City Primary elections. We show that our techniques
allow to significantly narrow down the field of possible election winners, and
in some case identify the winner as soon as election night despite a number of

1669,The Price of Political Uncertainty: Evidence from the 2016 U.S. Presidential Election and the U.S. Stock Markets,"There is bountiful evidence that political uncertainty stemming from
presidential elections or doubt about the direction of future policy make
financial markets significantly volatile, especially in proximity to close
elections or elections that may prompt radical policy changes. Although several
studies have examined the association between presidential elections and stock
returns, very little attention has been given to the impacts of elections and
election induced uncertainty on stock markets. This paper explores, at sectoral
level, the uncertain information hypothesis (UIH) as a means of explaining the
reaction of markets to the arrival of unanticipated information. This
hypothesis postulates that political uncertainty is greater prior to the
elections (relative to pre-election period) but is resolved once the outcome of
the elections is determined (relative to post-election period). To this end, we
adopt an event-study methodology that examines abnormal return behavior around
the election date. We show that collapsing stock returns around the election
result is reversed by positive abnormal return on the next day, except some
cases where we note negative responses following the vote count. Although
Trump's win plunges US into uncertain future, positive reactions of abnormal

peaceful and seamless transfer of power from one leader to another.
Democratically, this is measured in a citizen population's trust in the

documented issues of the 2016 US Presidential election, we conducted an
in-depth analysis of the 2018 US Midterm elections looking specifically for
voter fraud or suppression. The Midterm election occurs in the middle of a 4
year presidential term. For the 2018 midterms, 35 senators and all the 435
seats in the House of Representatives were up for re-election, thus, every
congressional district and practically every state had a federal election. In

1676,Sublinear Bounds for Randomized Leader Election,"This paper concerns {\em randomized} leader election in synchronous
distributed networks. A distributed leader election algorithm is presented for
complete $n$-node networks that runs in O(1) rounds and (with high probability)
uses only $O(\sqrt{n}\log^{3/2} n)$ messages to elect a unique leader (with
high probability). When considering the ""explicit"" variant of leader election
where eventually every node knows the identity of the leader, our algorithm
yields the asymptotically optimal bounds of O(1) rounds and O(n) messages. This
algorithm is then extended to one solving leader election on any connected
non-bipartite $n$-node graph $G$ in $O(\tau(G))$ time and
$O(\tau(G)\sqrt{n}\log^{3/2} n)$ messages, where $\tau(G)$ is the mixing time
of a random walk on $G$. The above result implies highly efficient (sublinear
running time and messages) leader election algorithms for networks with small
mixing times, such as expanders and hypercubes. In contrast, previous leader
election algorithms had at least linear message complexity even in complete
graphs. Moreover, super-linear message lower bounds are known for
time-efficient {\em deterministic} leader election algorithms.
  Finally, we present an almost matching lower bound for randomized leader
election, showing that $\Omega(\sqrt n)$ messages are needed for any leader
election algorithm that succeeds with probability at least $1/e + \eps$, for
any small constant $\eps > 0$.

1679,"Knowledge, Level of Symmetry, and Time of Leader Election","We study the time needed for deterministic leader election in the ${\cal
LOCAL}$ model, where in every round a node can exchange any messages with its
neighbors and perform any local computations. The topology of the network is
unknown and nodes are unlabeled, but ports at each node have arbitrary fixed
labelings which, together with the topology of the network, can create
asymmetries to be exploited in leader election. We consider two versions of the
leader election problem: strong LE in which exactly one leader has to be
elected, if this is possible, while all nodes must terminate declaring that
leader election is impossible otherwise, and weak LE, which differs from strong
LE in that no requirement on the behavior of nodes is imposed, if leader
election is impossible. We show that the time of leader election depends on
three parameters of the network: its diameter $D$, its size $n$, and its level
of symmetry $\lambda$, which, when leader election is feasible, is the smallest
depth at which some node has a unique view of the network. It also depends on

predict the desired geometric transformation to register 3D point clouds. In
this paper, we propose a meta-learning based 3D registration model, named 3D
Meta-Registration, that is capable of rapidly adapting and well generalizing to
new 3D registration tasks for unseen 3D point clouds. Our 3D Meta-Registration
gains a competitive advantage by training over a variety of 3D registration
tasks, which leads to an optimized model for the best performance on the
distribution of registration tasks including potentially unseen tasks.
Specifically, the proposed 3D Meta-Registration model consists of two modules:
3D registration learner and 3D registration meta-learner. During the training,
the 3D registration learner is trained to complete a specific registration task
aiming to determine the desired geometric transformation that aligns the source
point cloud with the target one. In the meantime, the 3D registration
meta-learner is trained to provide the optimal parameters to update the 3D
registration learner based on the learned task distribution. After training,
the 3D registration meta-learner, which is learned with the optimized coverage
of distribution of 3D registration tasks, is able to dynamically update 3D
registration learners with desired parameters to rapidly adapt to new

1682,A Deep Learning Framework for Unsupervised Affine and Deformable Image Registration,"Image registration, the process of aligning two or more images, is the core
technique of many (semi-)automatic medical image analysis tasks. Recent studies
have shown that deep learning methods, notably convolutional neural networks
(ConvNets), can be used for image registration. Thus far training of ConvNets
for registration was supervised using predefined example registrations.
However, obtaining example registrations is not trivial. To circumvent the need
for predefined examples, and thereby to increase convenience of training
ConvNets for image registration, we propose the Deep Learning Image
Registration (DLIR) framework for \textit{unsupervised} affine and deformable
image registration. In the DLIR framework ConvNets are trained for image
registration by exploiting image similarity analogous to conventional
intensity-based image registration. After a ConvNet has been trained with the
DLIR framework, it can be used to register pairs of unseen images in one shot.
We propose flexible ConvNets designs for affine image registration and for
deformable image registration. By stacking multiple of these ConvNets into a
larger architecture, we are able to perform coarse-to-fine image registration.
We show for registration of cardiac cine MRI and registration of chest CT that
performance of the DLIR framework is comparable to conventional image
registration while being several orders of magnitude faster.",1809.06130v2,cs.CV,2018-09-17 11:14:54+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Bob D. de Vos'), arxiv.Result.Author('Floris F.

accuracy with augmented reality during alignment of a holographic 3-dimensional

  Method: 18 participants in various stages of clinical training across two
academic centers registered a 3D CT phantom model onto a CT grid using the
HoloLens 2 augmented reality headset 3 consecutive times. Registration times
and accuracy were compared among different registration methods (hand gesture,
Xbox controller, and automatic registration), levels of clinical experience,
and consecutive attempts. Registration times were also compared with prior
HoloLens 1 data.
  Results: Mean aggregate manual registration times were 27.7, 24.3, and 72.8
seconds for one-handed gesture, two-handed gesture, and Xbox controller,
respectively; mean automatic registration time was 5.3s (ANOVA p<0.0001). No
significant difference in registration times was found among attendings,
residents and fellows, and medical students (p>0.05). Significant improvements
in registration times were detected across consecutive attempts using hand
gestures (p<0.01). Compared with previously reported HoloLens 1 experience,

accuracies were not significantly different across manual registration methods,

1684,Joint segmentation and discontinuity-preserving deformable registration: Application to cardiac cine-MR images,"Medical image registration is a challenging task involving the estimation of
spatial transformations to establish anatomical correspondence between pairs or
groups of images. Recently, deep learning-based image registration methods have
been widely explored, and demonstrated to enable fast and accurate image
registration in a variety of applications. However, most deep learning-based
registration methods assume that the deformation fields are smooth and
continuous everywhere in the image domain, which is not always true, especially
when registering images whose fields of view contain discontinuities at
tissue/organ boundaries. In such scenarios, enforcing smooth, globally
continuous deformation fields leads to incorrect/implausible registration
results. We propose a novel discontinuity-preserving image registration method
to tackle this challenge, which ensures globally discontinuous and locally
smooth deformation fields, leading to more accurate and realistic registration
results. The proposed method leverages the complementary nature of image
segmentation and registration and enables joint segmentation and pair-wise
registration of images. A co-attention block is proposed in the segmentation
component of the network to learn the structural correlations in the input
images, while a discontinuity-preserving registration strategy is employed in
the registration component of the network to ensure plausibility in the
estimated deformation fields at tissue/organ interfaces. We evaluate our method
on the task of intra-subject spatio-temporal image registration using
large-scale cinematic cardiac magnetic resonance image sequences, and
demonstrate that our method achieves significant improvements over the
state-of-the-art for medical image registration, and produces high-quality

1685,Towards Positive Jacobian: Learn to Postprocess Diffeomorphic Image Registration with Matrix Exponential,"We present a postprocessing layer for deformable image registration to make a
registration field more diffeomorphic by encouraging Jacobians of the
transformation to be positive. Diffeomorphic image registration is important
for medical imaging studies because of the properties like invertibility,
smoothness of the transformation, and topology preservation/non-folding of the
grid. Violation of these properties can lead to destruction of the
neighbourhood and the connectivity of anatomical structures during image
registration. Most of the recent deep learning methods do not explicitly
address this folding problem and try to solve it with a smoothness
regularization on the registration field. In this paper, we propose a
differentiable layer, which takes any registration field as its input, computes
exponential of the Jacobian matrices of the input and reconstructs a new
registration field from the exponentiated Jacobian matrices using Poisson
reconstruction. Our proposed Poisson reconstruction loss enforces positive
Jacobians for the final registration field. Thus, our method acts as a
post-processing layer without any learnable parameters of its own and can be
placed at the end of any deep learning pipeline to form an end-to-end learnable
framework. We show the effectiveness of our proposed method for a popular deep
learning registration method Voxelmorph and evaluate it with a dataset
containing 3D brain MRI scans. Our results show that our post-processing can
effectively decrease the number of non-positive Jacobians by a significant
amount without any noticeable deterioration of the registration accuracy, thus
making the registration field more diffeomorphic. Our code is available online

1689,Are Registration Uncertainty and Error Monotonically Associated,"In image-guided neurosurgery, current commercial systems usually provide only
rigid registration, partly because it is harder to predict, validate and
understand non-rigid registration error. For instance, when surgeons see a
discrepancy in aligned image features, they may not be able to distinguish
between registration error and actual tissue deformation caused by tumor
resection. In this case, the spatial distribution of registration error could
help them make more informed decisions, e.g., ignoring the registration where
the estimated error is high. However, error estimates are difficult to acquire.
Probabilistic image registration (PIR) methods provide measures of registration
uncertainty, which could be a surrogate for assessing the registration error.
It is intuitive and believed by many clinicians that high uncertainty indicates
a large error. However, the monotonic association between uncertainty and error
has not been examined in image registration literature. In this pilot study, we
attempt to address this fundamental problem by looking at one PIR method, the
Gaussian process (GP) registration. We systematically investigate the relation
between GP uncertainty and error based on clinical data and show empirically
that there is a weak-to-moderate positive monotonic correlation between

1693,Scale-Invariant Fast Functional Registration,"Functional registration algorithms represent point clouds as functions (e.g.
spacial occupancy field) avoiding unreliable correspondence estimation in
conventional least-squares registration algorithms. However, existing
functional registration algorithms are computationally expensive. Furthermore,
the capability of registration with unknown scale is necessary in tasks such as
CAD model-based object localization, yet no such support exists in functional
registration. In this work, we propose a scale-invariant, linear time
complexity functional registration algorithm. We achieve linear time complexity
through an efficient approximation of L2-distance between functions using
orthonormal basis functions. The use of orthonormal basis functions leads to a
formulation that is compatible with least-squares registration. Benefited from
the least-square formulation, we use the theory of
translation-rotation-invariant measurement to decouple scale estimation and
therefore achieve scale-invariant registration. We evaluate the proposed
algorithm, named FLS (functional least-squares), on standard 3D registration
benchmarks, showing FLS is an order of magnitude faster than state-of-the-art
functional registration algorithm without compromising accuracy and robustness.
FLS also outperforms state-of-the-art correspondence-based least-squares
registration algorithm on accuracy and robustness, with known and unknown
scale. Finally, we demonstrate applying FLS to register point clouds with
varying densities and partial overlaps, point clouds from different objects
within the same category, and point clouds from real world objects with noisy
RGB-D measurements.",2209.12763v1,cs.CV,2022-09-26 15:12:20+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Muchen Sun'), arxiv.Result.Author('Allison Pinosky'), arxiv.Result.Author('Ian Abraham'), arxiv.Result.Author('Todd Murphey')]","International Symposium of Robotics Research, 2022"

one-way permutations, due to Dumais, Mayers and Salvail (EUROCRYPT 2000)) with
pairwise independent hash functions. To construct our non-interactive quantum

1-out-of-2 binding commitment (of a parallel variant); (ii) from the
weakly-hiding and 1-out-of-2 binding commitment to a strongly-hiding and

from any one-way function. While the classical statistically-hiding bit
commitment has large round complexity, our quantum scheme is non-interactive,

Alice, is supposed to commit a long string instead of a single bit, to another
party say Bob. Similar to bit commitment schemes, such schemes are supposed to
be binding, i.e Alice cannot change her choice after committing, and concealing
i.e. Bob cannot find Alice's committed string before Alice reveals it.
  Ideal commitment schemes are known to be impossible. Even if some degrees of

succinct quantum state commitments, which can be seen as an analogue of
collision-resistant hashing for quantum messages. We also show that hiding
quantum state commitments (QSCs) are implied by any commitment scheme for
classical messages. All of our constructions can be based on
quantum-cryptographic assumptions that are implied by but are potentially
weaker than one-way functions.
  Commitments to quantum states open the door to many new cryptographic
possibilities. Our flagship application of a succinct QSC is a
quantum-communication version of Kilian's succinct arguments for any language
that has quantum PCPs with constant error and polylogarithmic locality.
Plugging in the PCP theorem, this yields succinct arguments for NP under

late eighties in the seminal work by Ben-Or et al. As was recently shown by
Cr\'{e}peau et al., the security of known two-prover commitment schemes not
only relies on the explicit assumption that the provers cannot communicate, but
also depends on their information processing capabilities. For instance, there
exist schemes that are secure against classical provers but insecure if the
provers have quantum information processing capabilities, and there are schemes
that resist such quantum attacks but become insecure when considering general
so-called non-signaling provers, which are restricted solely by the requirement
that no communication takes place.
  This poses the natural question whether there exists a two-prover commitment
scheme that is secure under the sole assumption that no communication takes
place; no such scheme is known.
  In this work, we give strong evidence for a negative answer: we show that any
single-round two-prover commitment scheme can be broken by a non-signaling
attack. Our negative result is as bad as it can get: for any candidate scheme
that is (almost) perfectly hiding, there exists a strategy that allows the
dishonest provers to open a commitment to an arbitrary bit (almost) as
successfully as the honest provers can open an honestly prepared commitment,
i.e., with probability (almost) 1 in case of a perfectly sound scheme. In the
case of multi-round schemes, our impossibility result is restricted to
perfectly hiding schemes.
  On the positive side, we show that the impossibility result can be
circumvented by considering three provers instead: there exists a three-prover
commitment scheme that is secure against arbitrary non-signaling attacks.",1505.03040v1,quant-ph,2015-05-12 14:53:03+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Serge Fehr'), arxiv.Result.Author('Max Fillinger')]",

this gap has since been an important and open question.

first show a lower bound of approximately 0.739, improving Kitaev's lower
bound. We then present an optimal quantum bit commitment protocol which has
cheating probability arbitrarily close to 0.739. More precisely, we show how to
use any weak coin flipping protocol with cheating probability 1/2 + eps in

quantum adversaries for a duration limited by the light-speed communication
time between the locations of the agents. We then propose a novel multi-round

Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) type of attack and delaying her measurements. One
might wonder if secure quantum bit commitment protocols exist at all. We answer
this question by showing that the same type of attack by Alice will, in
principle, break any bit commitment scheme. The cheating strategy generally
requires a quantum computer. We emphasize the generality of this ``no-go
theorem'': Unconditionally secure bit commitment schemes based on quantum
mechanics---fully quantum, classical or quantum but with measurements---are all
ruled out by this result. Since bit commitment is a useful primitive for
building up more sophisticated protocols such as zero-knowledge proofs, our
results cast very serious doubt on the security of quantum cryptography in the

In our set-up, the process of learning from others on a network is influenced
by confirmation bias, i.e. the tendency to ignore contrary evidence and
interpret it as consistent with one's own belief. When agents pay enough
attention to themselves, confirmation bias leads to slower learning in any
symmetric network, and it increases polarization in society. We identify a
subset of agents that become more/less influential with confirmation bias. The
socially optimal network structure depends critically on the information
available to the social planner. When she cannot observe agents' beliefs, the
optimal network is symmetric, vertex-transitive and has no self-loops. We
explore the implications of these results for electoral outcomes and media
markets. Confirmation bias increases the likelihood of shock elections, and it

1742,Leader-Contention-Based User Matching for 802.11 Multiuser MIMO Networks,"In multiuser MIMO (MU-MIMO) LANs, the achievable throughput of a client
depends on who are transmitting concurrently with it. Existing MU-MIMO MAC
protocols however enable clients to use the traditional 802.11 contention to
contend for concurrent transmission opportunities on the uplink. Such a
contention-based protocol not only wastes lots of channel time on multiple
rounds of contention, but also fails to maximally deliver the gain of MU-MIMO
because users randomly join concurrent transmissions without considering their
channel characteristics. To address such inefficiency, this paper introduces
MIMOMate, a leader-contention-based MU-MIMO MAC protocol that matches clients
as concurrent transmitters according to their channel characteristics to
maximally deliver the MU-MIMO gain, while ensuring all users to fairly share
concurrent transmission opportunities. Furthermore, MIMOMate elects the leader
of the matched users to contend for transmission opportunities using
traditional 802.11 CSMA/CA. It hence requires only a single contention overhead
for concurrent streams, and can be compatible with legacy 802.11 devices. A
prototype implementation in USRP-N200 shows that MIMOMate achieves an average
throughput gain of 1.42x and 1.52x over the traditional contention-based
protocol for 2-antenna and 3-antenna AP scenarios, respectively, and also
provides fairness for clients.",1404.6041v2,cs.NI,2014-04-24 06:43:52+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Tung-Wei Kuo'), arxiv.Result.Author('Kuang-Che Lee'), arxiv.Result.Author('Kate Ching-Ju Lin'), arxiv.Result.Author('Ming-Jer Tsai')]",

leader in $\mathcal{O}(n)$ rounds under an unfair sequential adversary, where
$n$ is the number of amoebots in the system. We then demonstrate how this

1745,Bicomp: A Bilayer Scalable Nakamoto Consensus Protocol,"Blockchain has received great attention in recent years and motivated
innovations in different scenarios. However, many vital issues which affect its
performance are still open. For example, it is widely convinced that high level
of security and scalability and full decentralization are still impossible to
achieve simultaneously. In this paper, we propose Bicomp, a bilayer scalable
Nakamoto consensus protocol, which is an approach based on high security and
pure decentralized Nakamoto consensus, and with a significant improvement on
scalability. In Bicomp, two kinds of blocks are generated, i.e., microblocks
for concurrent transaction packaging in network, and macroblocks for leadership
competition and chain formation. A leader is elected at beginning of each round
by using a macroblock header from proof-of-work. An elected leader then
receives and packages multiple microblocks mined by different nodes into one
macroblock during its tenure, which results in a bilayer block structure. Such
design limits a leader's power and encourages as many nodes as possible to
participate in the process of packaging transactions, which promotes the
sharding nature of the system. Furthermore, several mechanisms are carefully
designed to reduce transaction overlapping and further limit a leader's power,
among which a novel transaction diversity based metric is proposed as the
second level criteria besides the longest-chain-first principle on selecting a
legitimate chain when fork happens. Security issues and potential attacks to
Bicomp are extensively discussed and experiments for evaluation are performed.
From the experimental results based on 50 nodes all over the world, Bicomp
achieves significant improvement on scalability than that of Bitcoin and
Ethereum, while the security and decentralization merits are still preserved.",1809.01593v1,cs.NI,2018-09-05 16:06:49+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Zhenzhen Jiao'), arxiv.Result.Author('Rui Tian'), arxiv.Result.Author('Dezhong Shang'), arxiv.Result.Author('Hui Ding')]",

performance and robustness against two liveness and performance downgrade
attacks using an implementation running on Amazon EC2 in a wide area network

results show that Baxos offers more robustness to liveness and performance
downgrade attacks than leader-based consensus protocols. Baxos outperforms

candidate at a time. RCV ensures fairer elections and has been shown to
increase elected representation of women and people of color. A main drawback
of RCV is that the round-by-round process requires all the ballots to be
tallied before the results of an election can be calculated. With increasingly
large portions of ballots coming from absentee voters, RCV election outcomes
are not always apparent on election night, and can take several weeks to be
published, leading to a loss of trust in the electoral process from the public.
In this paper, we present an algorithm for efficiently computing possible
winners of RCV elections from partially known ballots and evaluate it on data
from the recent New York City Primary elections. We show that our techniques

replicas apply the same commands in the same order, even in the presence of

distributed consensus or by the use of a leader.
  This paper presents a protocol for linearizable state machine replication of
conflict-free replicated data types (CRDTs) that neither requires consensus nor
a leader. By leveraging the properties of state-based CRDTs - in particular,
the monotonic growth of a join semilattice - synchronization overhead is
greatly reduced. As a result, updates only need a single round trip and modify
the state 'in-place' without the need for a log. Furthermore, the message size
overhead for coordination consists of a single counter per message. For
queries, we guarantee finite writes termination. We show in an experimental
evaluation that more than 99 % of queries can be handled in one to three round
trips under highly concurrent accesses.
  Our protocol achieves high throughput without auxiliary processes such as
command log management or leader election. Thus, it is well suited for
practical scenarios that need linearizable access to CRDT data on a

uncertainty may lead them to make undesirable deviations in their decision

information to uninformed users with the hope of persuading them to take more
preferable actions. In this work, we study public and truthful signalling
mechanisms in the context of Bayesian congestion games on parallel networks. We
provide bounds on the possible benefit a signalling policy can provide with and
without the concurrent use of monetary incentives. We find that though
revealing information can reduce system cost in some settings, it can also be
detrimental and cause worse performance than not signalling at all. However, by
utilizing both signalling and incentive mechanisms, the system operator can
guarantee that revealing information does not worsen performance while offering
similar opportunities for improvement. These findings emerge from the closed
form bounds we derive on the benefit a signalling policy can provide. We
provide a numerical example which illustrates the phenomenon that revealing
more information can degrade performance when incentives are not used and
improves performance when incentives are used.",2204.06046v1,cs.GT,2022-04-12 19:06:24+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Bryce L. Ferguson'), arxiv.Result.Author('Philip N. Brown'), arxiv.Result.Author('Jason R. Marden')]",

1758,The Price of Political Uncertainty: Evidence from the 2016 U.S. Presidential Election and the U.S. Stock Markets,"There is bountiful evidence that political uncertainty stemming from
presidential elections or doubt about the direction of future policy make
financial markets significantly volatile, especially in proximity to close
elections or elections that may prompt radical policy changes. Although several
studies have examined the association between presidential elections and stock
returns, very little attention has been given to the impacts of elections and
election induced uncertainty on stock markets. This paper explores, at sectoral
level, the uncertain information hypothesis (UIH) as a means of explaining the
reaction of markets to the arrival of unanticipated information. This
hypothesis postulates that political uncertainty is greater prior to the
elections (relative to pre-election period) but is resolved once the outcome of
the elections is determined (relative to post-election period). To this end, we
adopt an event-study methodology that examines abnormal return behavior around
the election date. We show that collapsing stock returns around the election
result is reversed by positive abnormal return on the next day, except some
cases where we note negative responses following the vote count. Although
Trump's win plunges US into uncertain future, positive reactions of abnormal
return are found. Therefore, our results do not support the UIH hypothesis.
Besides, the effect of political uncertainty is sector-specific. While some
sectors emerged winners (healthcare, oil and gas, real estate, defense,
financials and consumer goods and services), others took the opposite route
(technology and utilities). The winning industries are generally those that
will benefit from the new administration's focus on rebuilding infrastructure,
renegotiating trade agreements, reforming tax policy and labour laws,
increasing defense funding, easing restrictions on energy production, and
rolling back Obamacare.",1612.06200v2,q-fin.GN,2016-12-19 14:28:59+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Jamal Bouoiyour'), arxiv.Result.Author('Refk Selmi')]",

1760,Sets of Half-Average Nulls Generate Risk-Limiting Audits: SHANGRLA,"Risk-limiting audits (RLAs) for many social choice functions can be reduced
to testing sets of null hypotheses of the form ""the average of this list is not
greater than 1/2"" for a collection of finite lists of nonnegative numbers. Such
social choice functions include majority, super-majority, plurality,
multi-winner plurality, Instant Runoff Voting (IRV), Borda count, approval
voting, and STAR-Voting, among others. The audit stops without a full hand
count iff all the null hypotheses are rejected. The nulls can be tested in many
ways. Ballot-polling is particularly simple; two new ballot-polling
risk-measuring functions for sampling without replacement are given.
Ballot-level comparison audits transform each null into an equivalent assertion
that the mean of re-scaled tabulation errors is not greater than 1/2. In turn,
that null can then be tested using the same statistical methods used for ballot
polling---but applied to different finite lists of nonnegative numbers.
SHANGRLA comparison audits are more efficient than previous comparison audits
for two reasons: (i) for most social choice functions, the conditions tested
are both necessary and sufficient for the reported outcome to be correct, while
previous methods tested conditions that were sufficient but not necessary, and
(ii) the tests avoid a conservative approximation. The SHANGRLA abstraction
simplifies stratified audits, including audits that combine ballot polling with
ballot-level comparisons, producing sharper audits than the ""SUITE"" approach.
SHANGRLA works with the ""phantoms to evil zombies"" strategy to treat missing
ballot cards and missing or redacted cast vote records. That also facilitates
sampling from ""ballot-style manifests,"" which can dramatically improve
efficiency when the audited contests do not appear on every ballot card.

numbering of ballots can be leveraged to weaken the conditions for learning.
Specifically, we define the notion of consecutive ballots and use this to
define Consecutive Quorums. Consecutive Quorums weakens the learning criterion
such that a learner does not need matching $accept$ messages sent in the $same
\; ballot$ from a majority of acceptors to learn a value. We prove that this
modification preserves the original safety and liveness guarantees of Paxos. We
define $Consecutive \; Paxos$ which encapsulates the properties of discrete
consecutive ballots. To establish the correctness of these results, we, in
addition to a paper proof, formally verify the correctness of a State Machine
Replication Library built on top of an optimized version of Multi-Paxos
modified to reflect $Consecutive \; Paxos$.",2006.01885v1,cs.DC,2020-06-02 19:08:46+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Eli Goldweber'), arxiv.Result.Author('Nuda Zhang'), arxiv.Result.Author('Manos Kapritsos')]",

protocols by introducing three conditions that together are sufficient to
guarantee ballot secrecy. There are two main advantages to using our
conditions, compared to existing automated approaches. The first is a
substantial expansion of the class of protocols and threat models that can be
automatically analysed: we can systematically deal with (a) honest authorities
present in different phases, (b) threat models in which no dishonest voters
occur, and (c) protocols whose ballot secrecy depends on fresh data coming from
other phases. The second advantage is that it can significantly improve
verification efficiency, as the individual conditions are often simpler to
verify. E.g., for the LEE protocol, we obtain a speedup of over two orders of
magnitude. We show the scope and effectiveness of our approach using ProVerif
in several case studies, including FOO, LEE, JCJ, and Belenios. In these case
studies, our approach does not yield any false attacks, suggesting that our

1763,Limiting Risk by Turning Manifest Phantoms into Evil Zombies,"Drawing a random sample of ballots to conduct a risk-limiting audit generally
requires knowing how the ballots cast in an election are organized into groups,
for instance, how many containers of ballots there are in all and how many
ballots are in each container. A list of the ballot group identifiers along
with number of ballots in each group is called a ballot manifest. What if the
ballot manifest is not accurate? Surprisingly, even if ballots are known to be
missing from the manifest, it is not necessary to make worst-case assumptions
about those ballots--for instance, to adjust the margin by the number of
missing ballots--to ensure that the audit remains conservative. Rather, it
suffices to make worst-case assumptions about the individual randomly selected
ballots that the audit cannot find. This observation provides a simple
modification to some risk-limiting audit procedures that makes them
automatically become more conservative if the ballot manifest has errors. The
modification--phantoms to evil zombies (~2EZ)--requires only an upper bound on
the total number of ballots cast. ~2EZ makes the audit P-value stochastically
larger than it would be had the manifest been accurate, automatically requiring
more than enough ballots to be audited to offset the manifest errors. This
ensures that the true risk limit remains smaller than the nominal risk limit.
On the other hand, if the manifest is in fact accurate and the upper bound on
the total number of ballots equals the total according to the manifest, ~2EZ
has no effect at all on the number of ballots audited nor on the true risk
limit.",1207.3413v1,stat.AP,2012-07-14 11:26:02+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Jorge H. Banuelos'), arxiv.Result.Author('Philip B. Stark')]",

selections on a BMD. We then required them to examine their ballots for any
changes from the slate they used to vote. Overall accuracy was exceptionally
high. Participants saw 1440 total contests, and of those 1440, there were a
total of 4 errors, so total accuracy was 99.8%. Participants were able to
perform with near-perfect accuracy regardless of ballot length, ballot type,
number of altered races, and location of altered races. Detection performance
was extremely robust. We conclude that with proper direction and resources,
voters can be near-perfect detectors of ballot changes on printed paper ballots
after voting with a BMD. This finding has significant implications for the
voting community as BMD use continues to grow. Research should now focus on
identifying administrative and behavioral methods that will prompt and

fine-grained liquid democracy, meaning that voters are able to designate a
partial coin to a set of election options and delegate the decision on how to
further split this partial coin among those election options to another voter

combined with our aim at fully respecting such delegations -- means that
inconsistencies and cycles can occur, thus we set to find
computationally-efficient ways of resolving voter delegations. To this aim we

Menu"" consisting of several prices. In equilibrium, the adversary can buy the
real ballots of any strict subset of districts at a price corresponding to the
willingness to sell on the part of the citizens holding such ballots. By
contrast, decoy voters are trapped into selling their ballots at a low, or even
negligible, price. Blowing up the adversary's budget by introducing decoy
ballots may thus turn out to be futile. The Devil's Menu can also be applied to

1771,The ATHENA Class of Risk-Limiting Ballot Polling Audits,"The main risk-limiting ballot polling audit in use today, BRAVO, is designed
for use when single ballots are drawn at random and a decision regarding
whether to stop the audit or draw another ballot is taken after each ballot
draw (ballot-by-ballot (B2) audits). On the other hand, real ballot polling
audits draw many ballots in a single round before determining whether to stop
(round-by-round (R2) audits). We show that BRAVO results in significant
inefficiency when directly applied to real R2 audits. We present the ATHENA
class of R2 stopping rules, which we show are risk-limiting if the round
schedule is pre-determined (before the audit begins). We prove that each rule
is at least as efficient as the corresponding BRAVO stopping rule applied at
the end of the round. We have open-source software libraries implementing most
of our results.
  We show that ATHENA halves the number of ballots required, for all state
margins in the 2016 US Presidential election and a first round with $90\%$
stopping probability, when compared to BRAVO (stopping rule applied at the end
of the round). We present simulation results supporting the 90% stopping
probability claims and our claims for the risk accrued in the first round.
Further, ATHENA reduces the number of ballots by more than a quarter for low
margins, when compared to the BRAVO stopping rule applied on ballots in
selection order. This implies that keeping track of the order when drawing
ballots R2 is not beneficial, because ATHENA is more efficient even without
information on selection order. These results are significant because current
approaches to real ballot polling election audits use the B2 BRAVO rules,
requiring about twice as much work on the part of election officials. Applying
the rules in selection order requires fewer ballots, but keeping track of the
order, and entering it into audit software, adds to the effort.",2008.02315v5,cs.CR,2020-08-05 18:47:37+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Filip Zagórski'), arxiv.Result.Author('Grant McClearn'), arxiv.Result.Author('Sarah Morin'), arxiv.Result.Author('Neal McBurnett'), arxiv.Result.Author('Poorvi L.

not require identification numbers on the ballots or counting many ballots per

SOBA combines three ideas: (1) publishing cast vote records (CVRs) separately
for each contest, so that anyone can verify that each reported contest outcome
is correct, if the CVRs reflect voters' intentions with sufficient accuracy;
(2) shrouding a mapping between ballots and the CVRs for those ballots to
prevent the loss of privacy that could occur otherwise; (3) assessing the
accuracy with which the CVRs reflect voters' intentions for a collection of
contests while simultaneously assessing the integrity of the shrouded mapping
between ballots and CVRs by comparing randomly selected ballots to the CVRs
that purport to represent them. Step (1) is related to work by the Humboldt
County Election Transparency Project, but publishing CVRs separately for
individual contests rather than images of entire ballots preserves privacy.
Step (2) requires a cryptographic commitment from elections officials.

of voters being unable to do so accurately or whether this is because voters
simply choose not to attempt verification in the first place. In order to
understand this problem, we conducted an experiment in which 108 participants
participated in a mock election where the BMD displayed the voters' true
choices, but then changed a subset of those choices on the printed ballot. The
design of the printed ballot, the length of the ballot, the number of changes

instructions provided to the voters were manipulated as part of the experiment.

incorrect election results, independent of why the result was incorrect.
Ballot-polling audits select ballots at random and interpret those ballots as
evidence for and against the reported result, continuing this process until
either they support the recorded result, or they fall back to a full manual
recount. For elections with digitised scanning and counting of ballots, a
comparison audit compares randomly selected digital ballots with their paper
versions. Discrepancies are referred to as errors, and are used to build
evidence against or in support of the recorded result. Risk-limiting audits for
first-past-the-post elections are well understood, and used in some US
elections. We define a number of approaches to ballot-polling and comparison
risk-limiting audits for Instant Runoff Voting (IRV) elections. We show that
for almost all real elections we found, we can perform a risk-limiting audit by
looking at only a small fraction of the total ballots (assuming no errors were
made in the tallying and distribution of votes).",1903.08804v2,cs.DS,2019-03-20 06:19:10+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Michelle Blom'), arxiv.Result.Author('Peter J. Stuckey'), arxiv.Result.Author('Vanessa Teague')]",

for the agents, on top of which random noises are added. We focus on
characterizing the smoothed satisfaction of two well-studied voting axioms:
Condorcet criterion and participation. We prove that for any fixed number of
alternatives, when the number of voters $n$ is sufficiently large, the smoothed
satisfaction of the Condorcet criterion under a wide range of voting rules is
$1$, $1-\exp(-\Theta(n))$, $\Theta(n^{-0.5})$, $ \exp(-\Theta(n))$, or being
$\Theta(1)$ and $1-\Theta(1)$ at the same time; and the smoothed satisfaction
of participation is $1-\Theta(n^{-0.5})$. Our results address open questions by

impossibility theorems, and are proved by worst-case analysis. Previous work
has investigated the likelihood for these impossibilities to occur under
certain models, which are often criticized of being unrealistic.
  We strengthen previous work by proving the first set of semi-random
impossibilities for voting rules to satisfy CC and the more general, group
versions of the four desiderata: for any sufficiently large number of voters
$n$, any size of the group $1\le B\le \sqrt n$, any voting rule $r$, and under
a large class of {\em semi-random} models that include Impartial Culture, the
likelihood for $r$ to satisfy CC and Par, CC and HM, CC and MM, or CC and SP is

only rule compatible with democratic principles. Instead, when the candidates
are three or more and the voters rank candidates in order of preference, there
are no univocal criteria for the selection of the winning (consensus) ranking
and the outcome is known to depend sensibly on the adopted rule. Building upon
XVIII century Condorcet theory, whose idea was to maximize total voter
satisfaction, we propose here the addition of a new basic principle (dimension)
to guide the selection: satisfaction should be distributed among voters as
equally as possible. With this new criterion we identify an optimal set of
rankings. They range from the Condorcet solution to the one which is the most
egalitarian with respect to the voters. We show that highly egalitarian
rankings have the important property to be more stable with respect to
fluctuations and that classical consensus rankings (Copeland, Tideman, Schulze)
often turn out to be non optimal. The new dimension we have introduced
provides, when used together with that of Condorcet, a clear classification of
all the possible rankings. By increasing awareness in selecting a consensus
ranking our method may lead to social choices which are more egalitarian
compared to those achieved by presently available voting systems.",1406.7642v2,physics.soc-ph,2014-06-30 09:21:32+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Pierluigi Contucci'), arxiv.Result.Author('Emanuele Panizzi'), arxiv.Result.Author('Federico Ricci-Tersenghi'), arxiv.Result.Author('Alina Sîrbu')]","Quality & Quantity, 50(3), 1185-1200, 2016"

a (possibly weak) majority of voters. The second notion is called local
stability (introduced in this paper): A size-$k$ committee is locally stable in
an election with $n$ voters if there is no candidate $c$ and no group of more
than $\frac{n}{k+1}$ voters such that each voter in this group prefers $c$ to
each committee member. We argue that Gehrlein-stable committees are appropriate
for shortlisting tasks, and that locally stable committees are better suited
for applications that require proportional representation. The goal of this
paper is to analyze these notions in detail, explore their compatibility with
notions of proportionality, and investigate the computational complexity of
related algorithmic tasks.",1701.08023v1,cs.GT,2017-01-27 12:11:12+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Haris Aziz'), arxiv.Result.Author('Edith Elkind'), arxiv.Result.Author('Piotr Faliszewski'), arxiv.Result.Author('Martin Lackner'), arxiv.Result.Author('Piotr Skowron')]",

profiles is the size of the smallest Condorcet winning set they admit. This
smallest size is called the Condorcet dimension of a preference profile. Since
little is known about profiles that have a certain Condorcet dimension, we show
in this paper how the problem of finding a preference profile that has a given
Condorcet dimension can be encoded as a satisfiability problem and solved by a
SAT solver. Initial results include a minimal example of a preference profile

states, and a more general continuous-space setting extending the first one. We
give a general robustness result for cycles not relying on a tie-breaking rule,
showing that they persist under small enough perturbations of the behavior of
voters. Then we give examples in Approval Voting of electorates applying
simple, sincere and consistent heuristics (namely Laslier's Leader Rule or a
modification of it) leading to cycles with bad outcomes, either not electing an
existing Condorcet winner, or possibly electing a candidate ranked last by a
majority of voters. Using the robustness result, it follows that those ""bad
cycles"" persist even if only a (large enough) fraction of the electorate
updates its choice of ballot at each iteration.We complete these results with

1790,Plurality in Spatial Voting Games with constant $β$,"Consider a set of voters $V$, represented by a multiset in a metric space

X$ is called a $\beta$-plurality point for $V$, if for any other choice $q\in
X$ it holds that $|\{v\in V\mid \beta\cdot d(p,v)\le d(q,v)\}|
\ge\frac{|V|}{2}$. In other words, at least half of the voters ""prefer"" $p$
over $q$, when an extra factor of $\beta$ is taken in favor of $p$. For
$\beta=1$, this is equivalent to Condorcet winner, which rarely exists. The
concept of $\beta$-plurality was suggested by Aronov, de Berg, Gudmundsson, and
Horton [SoCG 2020] as a relaxation of the Condorcet criterion.
  Let $\beta^*_{(X,d)}=\sup\{\beta\mid \mbox{every finite multiset $V$ in $X$
admits a $\beta$-plurality point}\}$. The parameter $\beta^*$ determines the
amount of relaxation required in order to reach a stable decision. Aronov et
al. showed that for the Euclidean plane
$\beta^*_{(\mathbb{R}^2,\|\cdot\|_2)}=\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}$, and more generally,
for $d$-dimensional Euclidean space, $\frac{1}{\sqrt{d}}\le

show that $0.557\le \beta^*_{(\mathbb{R}^d,\|\cdot\|_2)}$ for any dimension $d$

1791,Collective decision efficiency and optimal voting mechanisms: A comprehensive overview for multi-classifier models,"A new game-theoretic approach for combining multiple classifiers is proposed.
A short introduction in Game Theory and coalitions illustrate the way any
collective decision scheme can be viewed as a competitive game of coalitions
that are formed naturally when players state their preferences. The winning
conditions and the voting power of each player are studied under the scope of
voting power indices, as well and the collective competence of the group.
Coalitions and power indices are presented in relation to the Condorcet
criterion of optimality in voting systems, and weighted Borda count models are
asserted as a way to implement them in practice. A special case of coalition
games, the weighted majority games (WMG) are presented as a restricted
realization in dichotomy choice situations. As a result, the weighted majority
rules (WMR), an extended version of the simple majority rules, are asserted as
the theoretically optimal and complete solution to this type of coalition
gaming. Subsequently, a generalized version of WMRs is suggested as the means
to design a voting system that is optimal in the sense of both the correct
classification criterion and the Condorcet efficiency criterion. In the scope
of Pattern Recognition, a generalized risk-based approach is proposed as the
framework upon which any classifier combination scheme can be applied. A new
fully adaptive version of WMRs is proposed as a statistically invariant way of
adjusting the design process of the optimal WMR to the arbitrary
non-symmetrical properties of the underlying feature space. SVM theory is
associated with properties and conclusions that emerge from the game-theoretic
approach of the classification in general, while the theoretical and practical
implications of employing SVM experts in WMR combination schemes are briefly
discussed. Finally, a summary of the most important issues for further research

Condorcet consistent in general graphs, we show that Closeness centrality

to be closed in the sense that it contains the majority relation of every
profile with an odd number of individuals whose preferences belong to this
domain.
  We show that every closed Condorcet domain is naturally endowed with the
structure of a median graph and that, conversely, every median graph is
associated with a closed Condorcet domain (which may not be a unique one). The
subclass of those Condorcet domains that correspond to linear graphs (chains)
are exactly the preference domains with the classical single crossing property.
As a corollary, we obtain that the domains with the so-called `representative
voter property' (with the exception of a 4-cycle) are the single crossing
domains.
  Maximality of a Condorcet domain imposes additional restrictions on the
underlying median graph. We prove that among all trees only the chains can
induce maximal Condorcet domains, and we characterize the single crossing
domains that in fact do correspond to maximal Condorcet domains.

other alternative $B$ there are at least $k$ voters who prefer $A$ over $B$).
The notion of Condorcet winners has been studied intensively for many decades,
yet some basic questions remain open. In this paper, we consider a model where
each voter chooses their ranking randomly according to some probability
distribution among all rankings. One may then ask about the probability to have
a Condorcet winner with these randomly chosen rankings (which, of course,
depends on $n$ and $k$, and the underlying probability distribution on the set
of rankings). In the case of the uniform probability distribution over all
rankings, which has received a lot of attention and is often referred to as the
setting of an ""impartial culture"", we asymptotically determine the probability
of having a Condorcet winner for a fixed number $2k-1$ of voters and $n$
alternatives with $n\to \infty$. This question has been open for around fifty
years. While some authors suggested that the impartial culture should exhibit
the lowest possible probability of having a Condorcet winner, in fact the
probability can be much smaller for other distributions. We determine, for all
values of $n$ and $k$, the smallest possible probability of having a Condorcet
winner (and give an example of a probability distribution over all rankings

correct and independent, and a modern Machine Learning concept called ""Strength
of Weak Learnability"" (1990), which describes a method for converting a weak
learning algorithm into one that achieves arbitrarily high accuracy and stands
in the basis of Ensemble Learning. Albeit the intuitive statement of
Condorcet's theorem, we could not find a compact and simple rigorous

Learning nor in published papers. By all means we do not claim to discover or

profiles is the size of the smallest Condorcet winning set they admit. This
smallest size is called the Condorcet dimension of a preference profile. Since
little is known about profiles that have a certain Condorcet dimension, we show

1807,Convergence Voting: From Pairwise Comparisons to Consensus,"An important aspect of AI design and ethics is to create systems that reflect
aggregate preferences of the society. To this end, the techniques of social
choice theory are often utilized. We propose a new social choice function
motivated by the PageRank algorithm. The function ranks voting options based on
the Condorcet graph of pairwise comparisons. To this end, we transform the
Condorcet graph into a Markov chain whose stationary distribution provides the
scores of the options. We show how the values in the stationary distribution
can be interpreted as quantified aggregate support for the voting options, to
which the community of voters converges through an imaginary sequence of
negotiating steps. Because of that, we suggest the name ""convergence voting""
for the new voting scheme, and ""negotiated community support"" for the resulting
stationary allocation of scores.
  Our social choice function can be viewed as a consensus voting method,
sitting somewhere between Copeland and Borda. On the one hand, it does not
necessarily choose the Condorcet winner, as strong support from a part of the
society can outweigh mediocre uniform support. On the other hand, the influence
of unpopular candidates on the outcome is smaller than in the primary technique
of consensus voting, i.e., the Borda count. We achieve that without having to
introduce an ad hoc weighting that some other methods do.",2102.01995v3,cs.MA,2021-02-03 10:50:41+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Gergei Bana'), arxiv.Result.Author('Wojciech Jamroga'), arxiv.Result.Author('David Naccache'), arxiv.Result.Author('Peter Y. A. Ryan')]",
1808,Egalitarianism in the rank aggregation problem: a new dimension for democracy,"Winner selection by majority, in an election between two candidates, is the
only rule compatible with democratic principles. Instead, when the candidates
are three or more and the voters rank candidates in order of preference, there
are no univocal criteria for the selection of the winning (consensus) ranking
and the outcome is known to depend sensibly on the adopted rule. Building upon
XVIII century Condorcet theory, whose idea was to maximize total voter
satisfaction, we propose here the addition of a new basic principle (dimension)
to guide the selection: satisfaction should be distributed among voters as
equally as possible. With this new criterion we identify an optimal set of
rankings. They range from the Condorcet solution to the one which is the most
egalitarian with respect to the voters. We show that highly egalitarian
rankings have the important property to be more stable with respect to
fluctuations and that classical consensus rankings (Copeland, Tideman, Schulze)
often turn out to be non optimal. The new dimension we have introduced
provides, when used together with that of Condorcet, a clear classification of
all the possible rankings. By increasing awareness in selecting a consensus
ranking our method may lead to social choices which are more egalitarian
compared to those achieved by presently available voting systems.",1406.7642v2,physics.soc-ph,2014-06-30 09:21:32+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Pierluigi Contucci'), arxiv.Result.Author('Emanuele Panizzi'), arxiv.Result.Author('Federico Ricci-Tersenghi'), arxiv.Result.Author('Alina Sîrbu')]","Quality & Quantity, 50(3), 1185-1200, 2016"

existing methods are overviewed with special attention to several desirable
properties that are not always met. Particular emphasis is made on certain
rather unknown views of Condorcet about this subject. The proposed procedure
definitely aims for a choice in the spirit of approval voting. However, it
still makes use of the preferential information so as to improve the approval
one. This is done by means of the path scores, in common to Schulze's method
for preferential voting. The resulting method, that we call path-revised

positive and negative results for both neutral and anonymous versions of maxmin

conditions. We also show that Condorcet consistent rules that satisfy a mild

We present a simple proof of a result of May to show the limiting probability
of a Condorcet winner tends to zero as the number of candidates tends to
infinity. We show for the first time that the limiting probability of a
Condorcet winner for any given number of candidates $m$ is monotone decreasing
in $m$ for the equally likely case. This, in turn, settles the conjectures of
Kelly and Buckley and Westen for the case $n \to \infty$. We prove the validity

centrality and its random-walk version, Random-Walk Closeness centrality, are
the only classic centrality measures that are Condorcet consistent on trees,
i.e., if a Condorcet winner exists, they rank it first. While they are not
Condorcet consistent in general graphs, we show that Closeness centrality

to be closed in the sense that it contains the majority relation of every
profile with an odd number of individuals whose preferences belong to this
domain.
  We show that every closed Condorcet domain is naturally endowed with the
structure of a median graph and that, conversely, every median graph is
associated with a closed Condorcet domain (which may not be a unique one). The
subclass of those Condorcet domains that correspond to linear graphs (chains)
are exactly the preference domains with the classical single crossing property.
As a corollary, we obtain that the domains with the so-called `representative
voter property' (with the exception of a 4-cycle) are the single crossing
domains.
  Maximality of a Condorcet domain imposes additional restrictions on the
underlying median graph. We prove that among all trees only the chains can
induce maximal Condorcet domains, and we characterize the single crossing
domains that in fact do correspond to maximal Condorcet domains.

Arrow's Theorem, Adv. in Appl. Math. 29(3) (2002), pp. 412--426], Kalai
investigated the probability of a rational outcome for a generalized social
welfare function (GSWF) on three alternatives, when the individual preferences
are uniform and independent. In this paper we generalize Kalai's results to a
broader class of distributions of the individual preferences, and obtain new
lower bounds on the probability of a rational outcome in several classes of
GSWFs. In particular, we show that if the GSWF is monotone and balanced and the
distribution of the preferences is uniform, then the probability of a rational
outcome is at least 3/4, proving a conjecture raised by Kalai. The tools used
in the paper are analytic: the Fourier-Walsh expansion of Boolean functions on
the discrete cube, properties of the Bonamie-Beckner noise operator, and the

with arbitrary ran k order probabilities, when the voters are independent. We
provide a compact and complete Table for the limiting probability of a
Condorcet winner with three candidates and arbitrary rank order probabilities.
We present a simple proof of a result of May to show the limiting probability
of a Condorcet winner tends to zero as the number of candidates tends to
infinity. We show for the first time that the limiting probability of a
Condorcet winner for any given number of candidates $m$ is monotone decreasing
in $m$ for the equally likely case. This, in turn, settles the conjectures of
Kelly and Buckley and Westen for the case $n \to \infty$. We prove the validity

the only classic centrality measures that are Condorcet consistent on trees,

Condorcet consistent in general graphs, we show that Closeness centrality

1839,"Condorcet Domains, Median Graphs and the Single Crossing Property","Condorcet domains are sets of linear orders with the property that, whenever
the preferences of all voters belong to this set, the majority relation has no
cycles. We observe that, without loss of generality, such domain can be assumed
to be closed in the sense that it contains the majority relation of every
profile with an odd number of individuals whose preferences belong to this
domain.
  We show that every closed Condorcet domain is naturally endowed with the
structure of a median graph and that, conversely, every median graph is
associated with a closed Condorcet domain (which may not be a unique one). The
subclass of those Condorcet domains that correspond to linear graphs (chains)
are exactly the preference domains with the classical single crossing property.
As a corollary, we obtain that the domains with the so-called `representative
voter property' (with the exception of a 4-cycle) are the single crossing
domains.
  Maximality of a Condorcet domain imposes additional restrictions on the
underlying median graph. We prove that among all trees only the chains can
induce maximal Condorcet domains, and we characterize the single crossing
domains that in fact do correspond to maximal Condorcet domains.
  Finally, using Nehring's and Puppe's (2007) characterization of monotone
Arrowian aggregation, our analysis yields a rich class of strategy-proof social

1841,The Crowd Classification Problem: Social Dynamics of Binary Choice Accuracy,"Decades of research suggest that information exchange in groups and
organizations can reliably improve judgment accuracy in tasks such as financial
forecasting, market research, and medical decision-making. However, we show
that improving the accuracy of numeric estimates does not necessarily improve
the accuracy of decisions. For binary choice judgments, also known as
classification tasks--e.g. yes/no or build/buy decisions--social influence is
most likely to grow the majority vote share, regardless of the accuracy of that
opinion. As a result, initially inaccurate groups become increasingly
inaccurate after information exchange even as they signal stronger support. We
term this dynamic the ""crowd classification problem."" Using both a novel
dataset as well as a reanalysis of three previous datasets, we study this
process in two types of information exchange: (1) when people share votes only,
and (2) when people form and exchange numeric estimates prior to voting.
Surprisingly, when people exchange numeric estimates prior to voting, the
binary choice vote can become less accurate even as the average numeric
estimate becomes more accurate. Our findings recommend against voting as a form
of decision-making when groups are optimizing for accuracy. For those cases
where voting is required, we discuss strategies for managing communication to
avoid the crowd classification problem. We close with a discussion of how our
results contribute to a broader contingency theory of collective intelligence.",2104.11300v1,econ.GN,2021-04-22 20:00:52+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Joshua Becker'), arxiv.Result.Author('Douglas Guilbeault'), arxiv.Result.Author('Ned Smith')]",

with different preferences in different states; or predetermined with the same
preference in every state. In this setting, even if every voter is a contingent
voter, agents voting according to their private information need not result in
the adoption of the universally preferred alternative, because the signals can
be systematically biased.
  We present an easy-to-deploy mechanism that elicits and aggregates the
private signals from the voters, and outputs the alternative that is favored by
the majority. In particular, voters truthfully reporting their signals forms a
strong Bayes Nash equilibrium (where no coalition of voters can deviate and
receive a better outcome).",2108.03749v1,cs.GT,2021-08-08 22:20:15+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Grant Schoenebeck'), arxiv.Result.Author('Biaoshuai Tao')]","Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems 2021, Vol. 34,

how contingent allocation of prizes based on relative levels of support affects
equilibrium voting behavior. In addition to standard notions of pivotality,
voters influence the distribution of prizes across groups. Such prize
pivotality supports positive voter turnout even in non-competitive electoral
settings. The analysis shows that competition for a prize awarded to the most
supportive group is only stable when two groups actively support a party.
However, competition among groups to avoid punishment is stable in environments
with any number of groups. We conclude by examining implications for endogenous
group formation and how politicians structure the allocation of rewards and

incorporating respondent's predictions of others' answers, the model infers
latent parameters corresponding to the prior over world states and the
probability of different signals being received in all possible world states,
including counterfactual ones. Unlike other probabilistic models for

there is uncertainty about how others will vote. In this paper, we study
strategic voting when there is uncertainty about the voting method. We
introduce three notions of manipulability for a set of voting methods: sure,
safe, and expected manipulability. With the help of a computer program, we
identify voting scenarios in which uncertainty about the voting method may
reduce or even eliminate a voter's incentive to misrepresent her preferences.
Thus, it may be in the interest of an election designer who wishes to reduce
strategic voting to leave voters uncertain about which of several reasonable

agents since voting is costly. Misbehaving agents always vote. We compare
conventional voting allowing for abstention with vote delegation. Preferences
of voters are private information and a positive outcome is achieved if
well-behaving agents win. We illustrate that vote delegation leads to quite
different outcomes than conventional voting with abstention. In particular, we
obtain three insights: First, if the number of misbehaving voters, denoted by f
, is high, both voting methods fail to deliver a positive outcome. Second, if f
takes an intermediate value, conventional voting delivers a positive outcome,
while vote delegation fails with probability one. Third, if f is low,
delegation delivers a positive outcome with higher probability than
conventional voting. Finally, our results characterize worst-case outcomes that

on the tournament graph (like Copeland) respectively. We argue that with an
elimination style voting rule like single transferable vote, partial voting
does not change the situations where strategic voting is possible. However,
with scoring rules and rules based on the tournament graph, partial voting can
increase the situations where strategic voting is possible. As a consequence,
the computational complexity of computing a strategic vote can change. For
example, with Borda count, the complexity of computing a strategic vote can
decrease or stay the same depending on how we score partial votes.",1405.7714v1,cs.GT,2014-05-28 12:13:52+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Nina Narodytska'), arxiv.Result.Author('Toby Walsh')]",

winning alternative. Selection of a winner is accomplished via a voting rule,

voting rule should be used? In social choice theory, desirable properties of
voting rules are expressed as axioms to be satisfied. This thesis focuses on
axioms concerning strategic manipulation by voters. Sometimes, voters may
intentionally misstate their true preferences in order to alter the outcome for
their own advantage. For example, in plurality rule, if a voter knows that
their top-choice candidate will lose, then they might instead vote for their
second-choice candidate just to avoid an even less desirable result. When no
coalition of voters can strategically manipulate, then the voting rule is said
to satisfy the axiom of Strategy-Proofness. A less restrictive axiom is Weak
Strategy-Proofness (as defined by Dasgupta and Maskin (2019)), which allows for
strategic manipulation by all but the smallest coalitions. Under certain
intuitive conditions, Dasgupta and Maskin (2019) proved that the only voting
rules satisfying Strategy-Proofness are rank-order voting and majority rule. In
my thesis, I generalize their result, by proving that rank-order voting and
majority rule are surprisingly still the only voting rules satisfying Weak

likely to have a changed outcome due to vote corruption, when compared to a
majority vote. In fact, Mossel, O'Donnell and Oleszkiewicz proved in 2005 that
the majority voting method is most stable to this random vote corruption, among
voting methods where each person has a small influence on the election. We
discuss some recent progress on the analogous result for elections between more
than two candidates. In this case, plurality should be most stable to
corruption in votes. We also survey results on adversarial election

in a non-random way), and we briefly discuss ranked choice voting methods

quantum dots, driven by ultrafast lasers, under the effect of a dissipative
environment. In agreement with the standard practice, the environment is
modeled as a thermal bath of oscillators linearly coupled with the excitonic
states of the quantum dot. Standard techniques of quantum dissipation make the
problem amenable to a numerical treatment and allow to determine the fidelity
(the common gate-performance estimator), as a function of all the relevant
physical parameters. As a consequence of our analysis, we show that, by varying
in a suitable way the controllable parameters, the disturbance of the
environment can be (approximately) suppressed, and the performance of the gate
optimized--provided that the thermal bath is purely superhomic. We conclude by
showing that such an optimization it is impossible for ohmic environments.",quant-ph/0510056v3,quant-ph,2005-10-10 09:53:03+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Daniele Parodi'), arxiv.Result.Author('Maura Sassetti'), arxiv.Result.Author('Paolo Solinas'), arxiv.Result.Author('Paolo Zanardi'), arxiv.Result.Author('Nino Zanghi')]","Phys.

path, proves to be good at increasing overall efficiency and decreasing time to
fully deplete an environment, however it only works well when the resources are
of similar quality. The Leaf Cutter method, based on Leaf Cutter Ant behaviour,
assigns all gatherers first to the best resource, and once depleted, uses the
All Site model to spread them out amongst the rest. The Leaf Cutter model is
better at increasing resource influx in the short-term and vastly out-performs
the All Site model in a more varied environments. It is demonstrated that

dynamical systems over a finite time horizon. We formulate the problem as a
multi-step optimization problem under uncertainty seeking to identify a system
design and a control policy that jointly maximize the expected sum of rewards
collected over the time horizon considered. The transition function, the reward
function and the policy are all parametrized, assumed known and differentiable
with respect to their parameters. We then introduce a deep reinforcement
learning algorithm combining policy gradient methods with model-based
optimization techniques to solve this problem. In essence, our algorithm
iteratively approximates the gradient of the expected return via Monte-Carlo
sampling and automatic differentiation and takes projected gradient ascent
steps in the space of environment and policy parameters. This algorithm is
referred to as Direct Environment and Policy Search (DEPS). We assess the
performance of our algorithm in three environments concerned with the design
and control of a mass-spring-damper system, a small-scale off-grid power system
and a drone, respectively. In addition, our algorithm is benchmarked against a
state-of-the-art deep reinforcement learning algorithm used to tackle joint
design and control problems. We show that DEPS performs at least as well or
better in all three environments, consistently yielding solutions with higher
returns in fewer iterations. Finally, solutions produced by our algorithm are
also compared with solutions produced by an algorithm that does not jointly
optimize environment and policy parameters, highlighting the fact that higher
returns can be achieved when joint optimization is performed.",2006.01738v4,cs.LG,2020-06-02 16:08:07+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Adrien Bolland'), arxiv.Result.Author('Ioannis Boukas'), arxiv.Result.Author('Mathias Berger'), arxiv.Result.Author('Damien Ernst')]",Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research 73 (2022) 117-171

1876,Ability of Markovian Master Equations to Model Quantum Computers and Other Systems Under Broadband Control,"Most future quantum devices, including quantum computers, require control
that is broadband, meaning that the rate of change of the time-dependent
Hamiltonian is as fast or faster than the dynamics it generates. In many areas
of quantum physics, including quantum technology, one must include dissipation
and decoherence induced by the environment. While Markovian master equations
provide the only really efficient way to model these effects, these master
equations are derived for constant Hamiltonians (or those with a discrete set
of well-defined frequencies). In 2006, Alicky, Lidar, and Zanardi [Phys. Rev. A
73, 052311 (2006)] provided detailed qualitative arguments that Markovian
master equations could not describe systems under broadband control. Despite
apparently broad acceptance of these arguments, such master equations are
routinely used to model precisely these systems. This odd state of affairs is
likely due to a lack of quantitative results. Here we perform exact simulations
of two- and three-level systems coupled to an oscillator bath to obtain
quantitative results. Although we confirm that in general Markovian master
equations cannot predict the effects of damping under broadband control, we
find that there is a widely applicable regime in which they can. Master
equations are accurate for weak damping if both the Rabi frequencies and
bandwidth of the control are significantly smaller than the system's transition
frequencies. They also remain accurate if the bandwidth of control is as large
as the frequency of the driven transition so long as this bandwidth does not
overlap other transitions. Master equations are thus able to provide accurate
descriptions of many quantum information processing protocols for atomic
systems.",2001.11160v1,quant-ph,2020-01-30 03:12:53+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Gavin McCauley'), arxiv.Result.Author('Benjamin Cruikshank'), arxiv.Result.Author('Siddhartha Santra'), arxiv.Result.Author('Kurt Jacobs')]","Phys. Rev. Research 2, 013049 (2020)"
