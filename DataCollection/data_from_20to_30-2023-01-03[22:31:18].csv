0,Identifying Possible Winners in Ranked Choice Voting Elections with Outstanding Ballots,"Several election districts in the US have recently moved to ranked-choice
voting (RCV) to decide the results of local elections. RCV allows voters to
rank their choices, and the results are computed in rounds, eliminating one
candidate at a time. RCV ensures fairer elections and has been shown to
increase elected representation of women and people of color. A main drawback
of RCV is that the round-by-round process requires all the ballots to be
tallied before the results of an election can be calculated. With increasingly
large portions of ballots coming from absentee voters, RCV election outcomes
are not always apparent on election night, and can take several weeks to be
published, leading to a loss of trust in the electoral process from the public.
In this paper, we present an algorithm for efficiently computing possible
winners of RCV elections from partially known ballots and evaluate it on data
from the recent New York City Primary elections. We show that our techniques
allow to significantly narrow down the field of possible election winners, and
in some case identify the winner as soon as election night despite a number of
yet-unaccounted absentee ballots, providing more transparency in the electoral
process.",2206.12741v1,cs.CY,2022-06-25 22:08:15+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Alborz Jelvani'), arxiv.Result.Author('Amélie Marian')]",
1,On Covering a Solid Sphere with Concentric Spheres in ${\mathbb Z}^3$,"We show that a digital sphere, constructed by the circular sweep of a digital
semicircle (generatrix) around its diameter, consists of some holes
(absentee-voxels), which appear on its spherical surface of revolution. This
incompleteness calls for a proper characterization of the absentee-voxels whose
restoration will yield a complete spherical surface without any holes. In this
paper, we present a characterization of such absentee-voxels using certain
techniques of digital geometry and show that their count varies quadratically
with the radius of the semicircular generatrix. Next, we design an algorithm to
fill these absentee-voxels so as to generate a spherical surface of revolution,
which is more realistic from the viewpoint of visual perception. We further
show that covering a solid sphere by a set of complete spheres also results in
an asymptotically larger count of absentees, which is cubic in the radius of
the sphere. The characterization and generation of complete solid spheres
without any holes can also be accomplished in a similar fashion. We furnish
test results to substantiate our theoretical findings.",1411.1395v1,cs.CG,2014-10-23 05:05:23+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Sahadev Bera'), arxiv.Result.Author('Partha Bhowmick'), arxiv.Result.Author('Bhargab B. Bhattacharya')]",

3,Nurse Staffing under Absenteeism: A Distributionally Robust Optimization Approach,"We study the nurse staffing problem under random nurse demand and
absenteeism. While the demand uncertainty is exogenous (stemming from the
random patient census), the absenteeism uncertainty is \emph{endogenous}, i.e.,
the number of nurses who show up for work partially depends on the nurse
staffing level. For quality of care, many hospitals have developed float pools,
i.e., groups of hospital units, and trained nurses to be able to work in
multiple units (termed cross-training) in response to potential nurse shortage.
In this paper, we propose a distributionally robust nurse staffing (DRNS) model
that considers both exogenous and endogenous uncertainties. We derive a
separation algorithm to solve this model under a general structure of float
pools. In addition, we identify several pool structures that often arise in
practice and recast the corresponding DRNS model as a mixed-integer linear
program, which facilitates off-the-shelf commercial solvers. Furthermore, we
optimize the float pool design to reduce cross-training while achieving
specified target staffing costs. The numerical case studies, based on the data
of a collaborating hospital, suggest that the units with high absenteeism
probability should be pooled together.",1909.09875v2,math.OC,2019-09-21 19:15:54+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Minseok Ryu'), arxiv.Result.Author('Ruiwei Jiang')]",
4,On the Bee-Identification Error Exponent with Absentee Bees,"The ""bee-identification problem"" was formally defined by Tandon, Tan and
Varshney [IEEE Trans. Commun. (2019) [Online early access]], and the error
exponent was studied. This work extends the results for the ""absentee bees""
scenario, where a small fraction of the bees are absent in the beehive image
used for identification. For this setting, we present an exact characterization
of the bee-identification error exponent, and show that independent barcode
decoding is optimal, i.e., joint decoding of the bee barcodes does not result
in a better error exponent relative to independent decoding of each noisy
barcode. This is in contrast to the result without absentee bees, where joint
barcode decoding results in a significantly higher error exponent than
independent barcode decoding. We also define and characterize the ""capacity""
for the bee-identification problem with absentee bees, and prove the strong
converse for the same.",1910.10333v1,cs.IT,2019-10-23 03:57:35+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Anshoo Tandon'), arxiv.Result.Author('Vincent Y. F. Tan'), arxiv.Result.Author('Lav R. Varshney')]",
5,Integration of a machine learning model into a decision support tool to predict absenteeism at work of prospective employees,"Purpose - Inefficient hiring may result in lower productivity and higher
training costs. Productivity losses caused by absenteeism at work cost U.S.
employers billions of dollars each year. Also, employers typically spend a
considerable amount of time managing employees who perform poorly. The purpose
of this study is to develop a decision support tool to predict absenteeism
among potential employees. Design/methodology/approach - We utilized a popular
open-access dataset. In order to categorize absenteeism classes, the data have
been preprocessed, and four methods of machine learning classification have
been applied: Multinomial Logistic Regression (MLR), Support Vector Machines
(SVM), Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), and Random Forests (RF). We selected
the best model, based on several validation scores, and compared its
performance against the existing model; we then integrated the best model into
our proposed web-based for hiring managers. Findings - A web-based decision
tool allows hiring managers to make more informed decisions before hiring a
potential employee, thus reducing time, financial loss and reducing the
probability of economic insolvency. Originality/value - In this paper, we
propose a model that is trained based on attributes that can be collected
during the hiring process. Furthermore, hiring managers may lack experience in
machine learning or do not have the time to spend developing machine learning
algorithms. Thus, we propose a web-based interactive tool that can be used
without prior knowledge of machine learning algorithms.",2202.03577v1,cs.LG,2022-02-02 03:49:01+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Gopal Nath'), arxiv.Result.Author('Antoine Harfouche'), arxiv.Result.Author('Austin Coursey'), arxiv.Result.Author('Krishna K.

6,"Polarization, Abstention, and the Median Voter Theorem","The median voter theorem has long been the default model of voter behavior
and candidate choice. While contemporary work on the distribution of political
opinion has emphasized polarization and an increasing gap between the ""left""
and the ""right"" in democracies, the median voter theorem presents a model of
anti-polarization: competing candidates move to the center of the ideological
distribution to maximize vote share, regardless of the underlying ideological
distribution of voters. These anti-polar results, however, largely depend on
the ""singled-peakedness"" of voter preferences, an assumption that is rapidly
loosing relevance in the age of polarization. This article presents a model of
voter choice that examines three potential mechanisms that can undermine this
finding: a relative cost of voting that deters voters who are sufficiently
indifferent to both candidates, ideologically motivated third-party
alternatives that attract extreme voters, and a bimodal distribution of voter
ideology. Under reasonable sets of conditions and empirically observed voter
opinion distributions, these mechanisms can be sufficient to cause
strategically-minded candidates to fail to converge to the center, or to even
become more polarized than their electorate.",2103.12847v1,physics.soc-ph,2021-03-23 21:14:22+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Matthew I. Jones'), arxiv.Result.Author('Antonio D. Sirianni'), arxiv.Result.Author('Feng Fu')]",
7,A Fault Tolerance Improved Majority Voter for TMR System Architectures,"For digital system designs, triple modular redundancy (TMR), which is a
3-tuple version of N-modular redundancy is widely preferred for many
mission-control and safety-critical applications. The TMR scheme involves
two-times duplication of the simplex system hardware, with a majority voter
ensuring correctness provided at least two out of three copies of the system
remain operational. Thus the majority voter plays a pivotal role in ensuring
the correct operation of the system. The fundamental assumption implicit in the
TMR scheme is that the majority voter does not become faulty, which may not
hold well for implementations based on latest technology nodes with dimensions
of the order of just tens of nanometers. To overcome the drawbacks of the
classical majority voter some new voter designs were put forward in the
literature with the aim of enhancing the fault tolerance. However, these voter
designs generally ensure the correct system operation in the presence of either
a faulty function module or the faulty voter, considered only in isolation.
Since multiple faults may no longer be excluded in the nanoelectronics regime,
simultaneous fault occurrences on both the function module and the voter should
be considered, and the fault tolerance of the voters have to be analyzed under
such a scenario. In this context, this article proposes a new fault-tolerant
majority voter which is found to be more robust to faults than the existing
voters in the presence of faults occurring internally and/or externally to the
voter. Moreover, the proposed voter features less power dissipation, delay, and
area metrics based on the simulation results obtained by using a 32/28nm CMOS
process.",1605.03771v2,cs.AR,2016-05-12 11:54:44+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('P Balasubramanian'), arxiv.Result.Author('K Prasad')]","WSEAS Transactions on Circuits and Systems, vol. 15, Article #14,

8,On the Computational Complexity of Variants of Combinatorial Voter Control in Elections,"Voter control problems model situations in which an external agent tries
toaffect the result of an election by adding or deleting the fewest number of
voters. The goal of the agent is to make a specific candidate either win
(\emph{constructive} control) or lose (\emph{destructive} control) the
election. We study the constructive and destructive voter control problems
whenadding and deleting voters have a \emph{combinatorial flavor}: If we add
(resp.\ delete) a voter~$v$, we also add (resp.\ delete) a bundle~$\kappa(v) $
of voters that are associated with~$v$. While the bundle~$\kappa(v)$ may have
more than one voter, a voter may also be associated with more than one voter.
We analyze the computational complexity of the four voter control problems for
the Plurality rule. We obtain that, in general, making a candidate lose is
computationally easier than making her win. In particular, if the bundling
relation is symmetric (i.e.\ $\forall w\colon w \in \kappa(v) \Leftrightarrow v
\in \kappa(w) $), and if each voter has at most two voters associated with him,
then destructive control is polynomial-time solvable while the constructive
variant remains $\NP$-hard. Even if the bundles are disjoint (i.e.\ $\forall
w\colon w \in \kappa(v) \Leftrightarrow \kappa(v) = \kappa(w) $), the
constructive problem variants remain intractable. Finally, the minimization
variant of constructive control by adding voters does not admit an efficient
approximation algorithm, unless P=NP.",1701.05108v1,cs.MA,2017-01-18 15:36:46+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Leon Kellerhals'), arxiv.Result.Author('Viatcheslav Korenwein'), arxiv.Result.Author('Philipp Zschoche'), arxiv.Result.Author('Robert Bredereck'), arxiv.Result.Author('Jiehua Chen')]",
9,Ranking Swing Voters in Congressional Elections,"We present a model for quantitatively identifying swing voters in
congressional elections. This is achieved by predicting an individual voter's
likelihood to vote and an individual voter's likelihood to vote for a given
party, if he votes. We make a rough prediction of these values. We then update
these predictions by incorporating information on a municipality wide basis via
aggregate data to enhance our estimate under the assumption that nearby voters
have similar behavior, which could be due to social interaction or common
external factors. Finally, we use a ranking scheme on these predictions to
identify two key types of voter: 1) Voters who are likely to vote that we can
convince to vote for a given party; and, 2) Voters who are likely to vote for a
given party, if they vote, that we can convince to actually turn out to vote.
Once these voters have been identified, a political campaign can use this
information to micro-target voters and win more votes.",1405.5111v1,physics.soc-ph,2014-05-19 06:30:42+00:00,[arxiv.Result.Author('Steven Ambadjes')],

Euclidean if both the alternatives and the voters can be placed into a
2-dimensional space such that for each pair of alternatives, every voter
prefers the one which has a shorter Euclidean distance to the voter. We study
how 2-dimensional Euclidean preference profiles depend on the values m and n.
We find that any profile with at most two voters or at most three alternatives
is 2-dimensional Euclidean while for three voters, we can show this property
for up to seven alternatives. The results are tight in terms of Bogomolnaia and
Laslier [2, Proposition 15(1)].",2205.14687v1,cs.GT,2022-05-29 15:06:14+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Laurent Bulteau'), arxiv.Result.Author('Jiehua Chen')]",

12,TRIP: Trustless Coercion-Resistant In-Person Voter Registration,"Most existing remote electronic voting systems are vulnerable to voter
coercion and vote buying. While coercion-resistant voting systems address this
challenge, current schemes assume that the voter has access to an untappable,
incorruptible device during voter registration. We present TRIP, an in-person
voter registration scheme enabling voters to create verifiable and
indistinguishable real and fake credentials using an untrusted kiosk inside a
privacy booth at a supervised location, e.g., the registrar's office. TRIP
ensures the integrity of the voter's real credential while enabling the
creation of fake credentials using interactive zero-knowledge proofs between
the voter as the verifier and the kiosk as the prover, unbeknownst to the
average voter. TRIP ensures that even voters who are under extreme coercion,
and cannot leave the booth with a real credential, can delegate their vote to a
political party, with the caveat that they must then trust the kiosk. TRIP
optimizes the tallying process by limiting the number of credentials a voter
can receive and capping the number of votes that a credential can cast per
election. We conduct a preliminary usability study among 41 participants at a
university and found that 42.5% of participants rated TRIP a B or higher in
usability, a promising result for a voter registration scheme that
substantially reduces trust in the registrar.",2202.06692v1,cs.CR,2022-02-14 13:35:46+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Louis-Henri Merino'), arxiv.Result.Author('Simone Colombo'), arxiv.Result.Author('Jeff Allen'), arxiv.Result.Author('Vero Estrada-Galiñanes'), arxiv.Result.Author('Bryan Ford')]",

initiate the study of combinatorial variants of control by adding voters: In
our setting, when we choose to add a voter~$v$, we also have to add a whole

complexity of this problem for two of the most basic voting rules, namely the

14,A Parameterized Perspective on Protecting Elections,"We study the parameterized complexity of the optimal defense and optimal
attack problems in voting. In both the problems, the input is a set of voter
groups (every voter group is a set of votes) and two integers $k_a$ and $k_d$
corresponding to respectively the number of voter groups the attacker can
attack and the number of voter groups the defender can defend. A voter group
gets removed from the election if it is attacked but not defended. In the
optimal defense problem, we want to know if it is possible for the defender to
commit to a strategy of defending at most $k_d$ voter groups such that, no
matter which $k_a$ voter groups the attacker attacks, the outcome of the
election does not change. In the optimal attack problem, we want to know if it
is possible for the attacker to commit to a strategy of attacking $k_a$ voter
groups such that, no matter which $k_d$ voter groups the defender defends, the
outcome of the election is always different from the original (without any
attack) one.",1905.11838v1,cs.MA,2019-05-28 14:20:33+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Palash Dey'), arxiv.Result.Author('Neeldhara Misra'), arxiv.Result.Author('Swaprava Nath'), arxiv.Result.Author('Garima Shakya')]",
15,Wisdom of the Crowd Voting: Truthful Aggregation of Voter Information and Preferences,"We consider two-alternative elections where voters' preferences depend on a
state variable that is not directly observable. Each voter receives a private
signal that is correlated to the state variable. Voters may be ""contingent""
with different preferences in different states; or predetermined with the same
preference in every state. In this setting, even if every voter is a contingent
voter, agents voting according to their private information need not result in
the adoption of the universally preferred alternative, because the signals can
be systematically biased.
  We present an easy-to-deploy mechanism that elicits and aggregates the
private signals from the voters, and outputs the alternative that is favored by
the majority. In particular, voters truthfully reporting their signals forms a
strong Bayes Nash equilibrium (where no coalition of voters can deviate and
receive a better outcome).",2108.03749v1,cs.GT,2021-08-08 22:20:15+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Grant Schoenebeck'), arxiv.Result.Author('Biaoshuai Tao')]","Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems 2021, Vol. 34,

16,k-Majority Digraphs and the Hardness of Voting with a Constant Number of Voters,"Many hardness results in computational social choice make use of the fact
that every directed graph may be induced as the pairwise majority relation of
some preference profile. However, this fact requires a number of voters that is
almost linear in the number of alternatives. It is therefore unclear whether
these results remain intact when the number of voters is bounded, as is, for
example, typically the case in search engine aggregation settings. In this
paper, we provide a systematic study of majority digraphs for a constant number
of voters resulting in analytical, experimental, and complexity-theoretic
insights. First, we characterize the set of digraphs that can be induced by two
and three voters, respectively, and give sufficient conditions for larger
numbers of voters. Second, we present a surprisingly efficient implementation
via SAT solving for computing the minimal number of voters that is required to
induce a given digraph and experimentally evaluate how many voters are required
to induce the majority digraphs of real-world and generated preference
profiles. Finally, we leverage our sufficient conditions to show that the
winner determination problem of various well-known voting rules remains hard
even when there is only a small constant number of voters. In particular, we
show that Kemeny's rule is hard to evaluate for 7 voters, while previous
methods could only establish such a result for constant even numbers of voters.",1704.06304v1,cs.GT,2017-04-20 19:04:28+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Georg Bachmeier'), arxiv.Result.Author('Felix Brandt'), arxiv.Result.Author('Christian Geist'), arxiv.Result.Author('Paul Harrenstein'), arxiv.Result.Author('Keyvan Kardel'), arxiv.Result.Author('Dominik Peters'), arxiv.Result.Author('Hans Georg Seedig')]",
17,Reputation-Driven Voting Dynamics,"We introduce the reputational voter model (RVM) to account for the
time-varying abilities of individuals to influence their neighbors. To
understand of the RVM, we first discuss the fitness voter model (FVM), in which
each voter has a fixed and distinct fitness. In a voting event where voter $i$
is fitter than voter $j$, only $j$ changes opinion. We show that the dynamics
of the FVM and the voter model are identical. We next discuss the adaptive
voter model (AVM), in which the influencing voter in a voting event increases
its fitness by a fixed amount. The dynamics of the AVM is non-stationary and
slowly crosses over to that of FVM because of the gradual broadening of the
fitness distribution of the population. Finally, we treat the RVM, in which the
voter $i$ is endowed with a reputational rank $r_i$ that ranges from 1 (highest
rank) to $N$ (lowest), where $N$ is the population size. In a voting event in
which voter $i$ outranks $j$, only the opinion of $j$ changes. Concomitantly,
the rank of $i$ increases, while that of $j$ does not change. The rank
distribution remains uniform on the integers $1,2,3,\ldots,N$, leading to
stationary dynamics. For equal number of voters in the two voting states with
these two subpopulations having the same average rand, the time to reach
consensus in the mean-field limit scales as $\exp(\sqrt{N})$. This long
consensus time arises because the average rank of the minority population is
typically higher than that of the majority. Thus whenever consensus is
approached, this highly ranked minority tends to drive the population away from
consensus.",1902.09371v2,physics.soc-ph,2019-02-22 18:19:16+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('D. Bhat'), arxiv.Result.Author('S. Redner')]",J. Stat. Mech. (2019) 063208
18,Slower is faster: Fostering consensus formation by heterogeneous intertia,"We investigate an extension of the voter model in which voters are equipped
with an individual inertia to change their opinion. This inertia depends on the
persistence time of a voter's current opinion (ageing). We focus on the case of
only two different inertia values: zero if a voter just changed towards a new
opinion and $\nu$ otherwise. We are interested in the average time to reach
consensus, i.e. the state in which all voters have adopted the same opinion.
Adding inertia to the system means to slow down the dynamics at the voter's
level, which should presumably lead to a slower consensus formation. As an
unexpected outcome of our inertial voter dynamics, there is a parameter region
of $\nu$ where an increasing inertia leads to a faster consensus formation.
These results rest on the heterogeneity of voters which evolves through the
described ageing. In a control setting of homogeneous inertia values, we only
find monotonously increasing consensus times. In the paper, we present
dynamical equations for the mean-field case which allow for analytical insight
into the observed slower-is-faster effect.",0904.0765v1,physics.soc-ph,2009-04-05 12:22:31+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Hans-Ulrich Stark'), arxiv.Result.Author('Claudio J. Tessone'), arxiv.Result.Author('Frank Schweitzer')]","ACS - Advances in Complex Systems, vol 11, no 4 (2008) pp. 87-116"
19,On the Number of Single-Peaked Narcissistic or Single-Crossing Narcissistic Preference Profiles,"We investigate preference profiles for a set $\mathcal{V}$ of voters, where
each voter $i$ has a preference order $\succ_i$ on a finite set $A$ of
alternatives (that is, a linear order on $A$) such that for each two
alternatives $a,b\in A$, voter $i$ prefers $a$ to $b$ if $a\succ_i b$. Such a
profile is narcissistic if each alternative $a$ is preferred the most by at
least one voter. It is single-peaked if there is a linear order
$\triangleright^{\text{sp}}$ on the alternatives such that each voter's
preferences on the alternatives along the order $\triangleright^{\text{sp}}$
are either strictly increasing, or strictly decreasing, or first strictly
increasing and then strictly decreasing. It is single-crossing if there is a
linear order $\triangleright^{\text{sc}}$ on the voters such that each pair of
alternatives divides the order $\triangleright^{\text{sc}}$ into at most two
suborders, where in each suborder, all voters have the same linear order on
this pair.
  We show that for $n$ voters and $n$ alternatives,the number of single-peaked
narcissistic profiles is $\prod_{i=2}^{n-1} \binom{n-1}{i-1}$ while the number

21,Identifying Possible Winners in Ranked Choice Voting Elections with Outstanding Ballots,"Several election districts in the US have recently moved to ranked-choice
voting (RCV) to decide the results of local elections. RCV allows voters to
rank their choices, and the results are computed in rounds, eliminating one
candidate at a time. RCV ensures fairer elections and has been shown to
increase elected representation of women and people of color. A main drawback
of RCV is that the round-by-round process requires all the ballots to be
tallied before the results of an election can be calculated. With increasingly
large portions of ballots coming from absentee voters, RCV election outcomes
are not always apparent on election night, and can take several weeks to be
published, leading to a loss of trust in the electoral process from the public.
In this paper, we present an algorithm for efficiently computing possible
winners of RCV elections from partially known ballots and evaluate it on data
from the recent New York City Primary elections. We show that our techniques
allow to significantly narrow down the field of possible election winners, and
in some case identify the winner as soon as election night despite a number of

22,Distributed Learning over a Wireless Network with Non-coherent Majority Vote Computation,"In this study, we propose an over-the-air computation (OAC) scheme to
calculate the majority vote (MV) for federated edge learning (FEEL). With the
proposed approach, edge devices (EDs) transmit the signs of local stochastic
gradients, i.e., votes, by activating one of two orthogonal resources. The MVs
at the edge server (ES) are obtained with non-coherent detectors by exploiting
the accumulations on the resources. Hence, the proposed scheme eliminates the
need for channel state information (CSI) at the EDs and ES. In this study, we
analyze various gradient-encoding strategies through the weight functions and
waveform configurations over orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM).
We show that specific weight functions that enable absentee EDs (i.e.,
hard-coded participation with absentees (HPA)) or weighted votes (i.e.,
soft-coded participation (SP)) can substantially reduce the probability of
detecting the incorrect MV. By taking path loss, power control, cell size, and
fading channel into account, we prove the convergence of the distributed
learning for a non-convex function for HPA. Through simulations, we show that
the proposed scheme with HPA and SP can provide high test accuracy even when

severe vulnerabilities that could be leveraged to manipulate votes, violate
ballot privacy, and subvert the verification mechanism. These vulnerabilities
do not seem to have been detected by the election authorities before we
disclosed them, despite a pre-election security review and despite the system
having run in a live state election for five days. One vulnerability, the
result of including analytics software from an insecure external server,
exposed some votes to complete compromise of privacy and integrity. At least
one parliamentary seat was decided by a margin much smaller than the number of
votes taken while the system was vulnerable. We also found protocol flaws,

24,The 2004 Venezuelan Presidential Recall Referendum: Discrepancies Between Two Exit Polls and Official Results,"We present a simulation-based study in which the results of two major exit
polls conducted during the recall referendum that took place in Venezuela on
August 15, 2004, are compared to the official results of the Venezuelan
National Electoral Council ""Consejo Nacional Electoral"" (CNE). The two exit
polls considered here were conducted independently by S\'{u}mate, a
nongovernmental organization, and Primero Justicia, a political party. We find
significant discrepancies between the exit poll data and the official CNE
results in about 60% of the voting centers that were sampled in these polls. We
show that discrepancies between exit polls and official results are not due to
a biased selection of the voting centers or to problems related to the size of
the samples taken at each center. We found discrepancies in all the states
where the polls were conducted. We do not have enough information on the exit
poll data to determine whether the observed discrepancies are the consequence
of systematic biases in the selection of the people interviewed by the
pollsters around the country. Neither do we have information to study the
possibility of a high number of false or nonrespondents. We have limited data
suggesting that the discrepancies are not due to a drastic change in the voting
patterns that occurred after the exit polls were conducted. We notice that the
two exit polls were done independently and had few centers in common, yet their

electronic voting machines and voting centers classified by types of

transmissions and only one type where cellular telephony is employed,
contravening any reasonable electoral normative. Differentiation in data
transmissions arise when comparing number of incoming and outgoing data bytes
per machine against total number of votes per machine reported officially by
the CNE. The respective distributions of electoral variables for each type of
transmission show that the groups classified by it do not correspond to random
sets of the electoral universe. In particular, the distributions for the NO
percentage of votes per machine differ statistically across groups. The
presidential elections of 1998, 2000 and the 2004 Presidential Recall

27,"Quick Anomaly Detection by the Newcomb--Benford Law, with Applications to Electoral Processes Data from the USA, Puerto Rico and Venezuela","A simple and quick general test to screen for numerical anomalies is
presented. It can be applied, for example, to electoral processes, both
electronic and manual. It uses vote counts in officially published voting
units, which are typically widely available and institutionally backed. The
test examines the frequencies of digits on voting counts and rests on the First
(NBL1) and Second Digit Newcomb--Benford Law (NBL2), and in a novel
generalization of the law under restrictions of the maximum number of voters
per unit (RNBL2). We apply the test to the 2004 USA presidential elections, the
Puerto Rico (1996, 2000 and 2004) governor elections, the 2004 Venezuelan
presidential recall referendum (RRP) and the previous 2000 Venezuelan
Presidential election. The NBL2 is compellingly rejected only in the Venezuelan
referendum and only for electronic voting units. Our original suggestion on the
RRP (Pericchi and Torres, 2004) was criticized by The Carter Center report

presented voting models and case studies in favor of NBL2. Further evidence is
presented here. Moreover, under the RNBL2, Mebane's voting models are valid
under wider conditions. The adequacy of the law is assessed through Bayes
Factors (and corrections of $p$-values) instead of significance testing, since
for large sample sizes and fixed $\alpha$ levels the null hypothesis is over
rejected. Our tests are extremely simple and can become a standard screening

28,Cyber-Risks in Paper Voting,"Paper ballot voting with its fully-reviewable paper-trail is usually
considered as more secure than their e-voting counterparts, given the large
number of recent incidents. In this work, we explore the security of paper
voting and show that paper voting, as it is implemented today, is surprisingly
vulnerable to cyber-attacks. In particular, the aggregation methods of
preliminary voting results of various countries rely on insecure communication
channels like telephone, fax or non-secure e-mail. Furthermore, regulations
typically do not mandate the use of secure channels for the transmission of
preliminary results. We illustrate that preliminary results, despite their
temporary nature, may have a severe impact on real-world decisions during the 3
to 30 days window until the final results are declared. An attacker exploiting
this discrepancy can, e.g., benefit from stock market manipulation or call into
question the legitimacy of the elections. This work investigates the
cyber-risks in paper voting in a systematic manner by reviewing procedures in
several countries (Estonia, France, Germany, the United Kingdom, and the United
States of America) and through a comprehensive case-study of Switzerland. We
examine the transmission systems currently in use through inquires from
election officials. Moreover, we illustrate the feasibility of attacks by
analyzing the frequent historical discrepancies between preliminary and final
results. Considering our results and recent reports about easily modifiable
preliminary results in Germany and the Netherlands, we conjecture similar
weaknesses in other countries as well.",1906.07532v3,cs.CR,2019-06-18 12:41:23+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('David M. Sommer'), arxiv.Result.Author('Moritz Schneider'), arxiv.Result.Author('Jannik Gut'), arxiv.Result.Author('Srdjan Capkun')]",

which is more realistic from the viewpoint of visual perception. We further
show that covering a solid sphere by a set of complete spheres also results in
an asymptotically larger count of absentees, which is cubic in the radius of

Referendum celebrated in Venezuela on August 15, 2004. We define fraud as the
difference between the elector's intent, and the official vote tally. Our null
hypothesis is that there was no fraud, and we attempt to search for evidence
that will allow us to reject this hypothesis. We find no evidence that fraud
was committed by applying numerical maximums to machines in some precincts.
Equally, we discard any hypothesis that implies altering some machines and not
others, at each electoral precinct, because the variation patterns between
machines at each precinct are normal. However, the statistical evidence is
compatible with the occurrence of fraud that has affected every machine in a
single precinct, but differentially more in some precincts than others. We find
that the deviation pattern between precincts, based on the relationship between
the signatures collected to request the referendum in November 2003 (the
so-called, Reafirmazo), and the YES votes on August 15, is positive and
significantly correlated with the deviation pattern in the relationship between
exit polls and votes in those same precincts. In other words, those precincts
in which, according to the number of signatures, there are an unusually low
number of YES votes (i.e., votes to impeach the president), is also where,

have practical constraints: time is of the essence, and voting systems need to
be affordable and maintainable, and usable by voters, election officials, and
pollworkers. It is thus not surprising that voting is a rich research area
spanning theory, applied cryptography, practical systems analysis, usable
security, and statistics. Election integrity involves two key concepts:
convincing evidence that outcomes are correct and privacy, which amounts to

successfully implemented electronic voting systems and other countries are at
various piloting stages to address many challenges associated with manual paper
based system such ascosts of physical ballot paper and other overheads,
electoral delays, distribution of electoral materials, and general lack of
confidence in the electoral process. It is in this context that this study
explores how South African can leverage the opportunities that e-voting
presents. Manual voting is often tedious, non-secure, and time-consuming, which
leads us to think about using electronic facilities to make the process more
efficient. This study proposes that the adoption of electronic voting
technologies could perhaps mitigate some of these issues and challengesin the
process improving the electoral process. The study used an on-line
questionnaire which was administered to a broader group of voters and an
in-depth semi-structured interview with the Independent Electoral Commission
officials. The analysis is based on thematic analysis and diffusion of
innovations theory is adopted as a theoretical lens of analysis. The findings
reveal that relative advantage, compatibility and complexity would determine
the intentions of South African voters and the Electoral Management Bodies

several other factorsthat could influence the adoption process. The study is
limited to only voters in Cape Town and these voters were expected to have some

36,Locating ballot drop boxes,"For decades, voting-by-mail and the use of ballot drop boxes has
substantially grown, and in response, many election officials have added new
drop boxes to their voting infrastructure. However, existing guidance for
locating drop boxes is limited. In this paper, we introduce an integer
programming model, the drop box location problem (DBLP), to locate drop boxes.
The DBLP considers criteria of cost, voter access, and risk. The cost of the
drop box system is determined by the fixed cost of adding drop boxes and the
operational cost of a collection tour by a bipartisan team who regularly
collects ballots from selected locations. The DBLP utilizes covering sets to
ensure each voter is in close proximity to a drop box and incorporates a novel
measure of access to measure the ability to use multiple voting pathways to
vote. The DBLP is shown to be NP-Hard, and we introduce a heuristic to generate
a large number of feasible solutions for policy makers to select from a
posteriori. Using a real-world case study of Milwaukee, WI, we study the
benefit of the DBLP. The results demonstrate that the proposed optimization
model identifies drop box locations that perform well across multiple criteria.
The results also demonstrate that the trade-off between cost, access, and risk
is non-trivial, which supports the use of the proposed optimization-based
approach to select drop box locations.",2207.10707v2,math.OC,2022-07-21 18:41:38+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Adam P. Schmidt'), arxiv.Result.Author('Laura A. Albert')]",

campaigning for election over these multiple cycles or rounds of voting. Much
of the work on COMSOC to date has investigated strategic actions in only a
single round. We introduce a novel formal model of \emph{pandering}, or
strategic preference reporting by candidates seeking to be elected, and examine
the resilience of two democratic voting systems to pandering within a single
round and across multiple rounds. The two voting systems we compare are
Representative Democracy (RD) and Flexible Representative Democracy (FRD). For
each voting system, our analysis centers on the types of strategies candidates
employ and how voters update their views of candidates based on how the
candidates have pandered in the past. We provide theoretical results on the
complexity of pandering in our setting for a single cycle, formulate our
problem for multiple cycles as a Markov Decision Process, and use reinforcement
learning to study the effects of pandering by both single candidates and groups

In this paper, we propose a distributionally robust nurse staffing (DRNS) model

41,Identifying Possible Winners in Ranked Choice Voting Elections with Outstanding Ballots,"Several election districts in the US have recently moved to ranked-choice
voting (RCV) to decide the results of local elections. RCV allows voters to
rank their choices, and the results are computed in rounds, eliminating one
candidate at a time. RCV ensures fairer elections and has been shown to
increase elected representation of women and people of color. A main drawback
of RCV is that the round-by-round process requires all the ballots to be
tallied before the results of an election can be calculated. With increasingly
large portions of ballots coming from absentee voters, RCV election outcomes
are not always apparent on election night, and can take several weeks to be
published, leading to a loss of trust in the electoral process from the public.
In this paper, we present an algorithm for efficiently computing possible
winners of RCV elections from partially known ballots and evaluate it on data
from the recent New York City Primary elections. We show that our techniques
allow to significantly narrow down the field of possible election winners, and
in some case identify the winner as soon as election night despite a number of

proposed approach, edge devices (EDs) transmit the signs of local stochastic
gradients, i.e., votes, by activating one of two orthogonal resources. The MVs
at the edge server (ES) are obtained with non-coherent detectors by exploiting
the accumulations on the resources. Hence, the proposed scheme eliminates the
need for channel state information (CSI) at the EDs and ES. In this study, we
analyze various gradient-encoding strategies through the weight functions and
waveform configurations over orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM).
We show that specific weight functions that enable absentee EDs (i.e.,
hard-coded participation with absentees (HPA)) or weighted votes (i.e.,
soft-coded participation (SP)) can substantially reduce the probability of
detecting the incorrect MV. By taking path loss, power control, cell size, and
fading channel into account, we prove the convergence of the distributed
learning for a non-convex function for HPA. Through simulations, we show that
the proposed scheme with HPA and SP can provide high test accuracy even when
the time-synchronization and the power control are not ideal under
heterogeneous data distribution scenarios.",2209.04692v2,cs.IT,2022-09-10 15:25:45+00:00,[arxiv.Result.Author('Alphan Sahin')],

decoding is optimal, i.e., joint decoding of the bee barcodes does not result
in a better error exponent relative to independent decoding of each noisy
barcode. This is in contrast to the result without absentee bees, where joint
barcode decoding results in a significantly higher error exponent than

49,Strategic Voting Under Uncertainty About the Voting Method,"Much of the theoretical work on strategic voting makes strong assumptions
about what voters know about the voting situation. A strategizing voter is
typically assumed to know how other voters will vote and to know the rules of
the voting method. A growing body of literature explores strategic voting when
there is uncertainty about how others will vote. In this paper, we study
strategic voting when there is uncertainty about the voting method. We
introduce three notions of manipulability for a set of voting methods: sure,
safe, and expected manipulability. With the help of a computer program, we
identify voting scenarios in which uncertainty about the voting method may
reduce or even eliminate a voter's incentive to misrepresent her preferences.
Thus, it may be in the interest of an election designer who wishes to reduce
strategic voting to leave voters uncertain about which of several reasonable
voting methods will be used to determine the winners of an election.",1907.09110v1,cs.MA,2019-07-22 03:17:19+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Wesley H. Holliday'), arxiv.Result.Author('Eric Pacuit')]","EPTCS 297, 2019, pp. 252-272"

validation or governance tasks on blockchains. There is a majority of
well-behaving agents, but they may abstain or delegate their vote to other
agents since voting is costly. Misbehaving agents always vote. We compare
conventional voting allowing for abstention with vote delegation. Preferences
of voters are private information and a positive outcome is achieved if
well-behaving agents win. We illustrate that vote delegation leads to quite
different outcomes than conventional voting with abstention. In particular, we
obtain three insights: First, if the number of misbehaving voters, denoted by f
, is high, both voting methods fail to deliver a positive outcome. Second, if f
takes an intermediate value, conventional voting delivers a positive outcome,
while vote delegation fails with probability one. Third, if f is low,
delegation delivers a positive outcome with higher probability than
conventional voting. Finally, our results characterize worst-case outcomes that
can happen in a liquid democracy.",2102.08823v2,cs.GT,2021-02-17 15:32:32+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Hans Gersbach'), arxiv.Result.Author('Akaki Mamageishvili'), arxiv.Result.Author('Manvir Schneider')]",

count), elimination style rules (like single transferable vote) and rules based
on the tournament graph (like Copeland) respectively. We argue that with an
elimination style voting rule like single transferable vote, partial voting
does not change the situations where strategic voting is possible. However,
with scoring rules and rules based on the tournament graph, partial voting can
increase the situations where strategic voting is possible. As a consequence,
the computational complexity of computing a strategic vote can change. For
example, with Borda count, the complexity of computing a strategic vote can
decrease or stay the same depending on how we score partial votes.",1405.7714v1,cs.GT,2014-05-28 12:13:52+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Nina Narodytska'), arxiv.Result.Author('Toby Walsh')]",

electronic voting via electronic voting machines (EVMs) improves fairness by
relying on centralized trust. Homomorphic encryption-based voting protocols
also assure fairness but cannot scale to large scale elections such as

distributing trust to propose a smart contract-based protocol, namely, \proto.
There are many existing protocols for voting using smart contracts. We observe
that these either are not scalable or leak the vote tally during the voting
stage, i.e., do not provide vote concealment. In contrast, we show that FASTEN
preserves voter's privacy ensures vote concealment, immutability, and avoids
double voting. We prove that the probability of privacy breaches is negligibly
small. Further, our cost analysis of executing FASTEN over Ethereum is

55,Exploring Weak Strategy-Proofness in Voting Theory,"Voting is the aggregation of individual preferences in order to select a
winning alternative. Selection of a winner is accomplished via a voting rule,
e.g., rank-order voting, majority rule, plurality rule, approval voting. Which
voting rule should be used? In social choice theory, desirable properties of
voting rules are expressed as axioms to be satisfied. This thesis focuses on
axioms concerning strategic manipulation by voters. Sometimes, voters may
intentionally misstate their true preferences in order to alter the outcome for
their own advantage. For example, in plurality rule, if a voter knows that
their top-choice candidate will lose, then they might instead vote for their
second-choice candidate just to avoid an even less desirable result. When no
coalition of voters can strategically manipulate, then the voting rule is said
to satisfy the axiom of Strategy-Proofness. A less restrictive axiom is Weak
Strategy-Proofness (as defined by Dasgupta and Maskin (2019)), which allows for
strategic manipulation by all but the smallest coalitions. Under certain
intuitive conditions, Dasgupta and Maskin (2019) proved that the only voting
rules satisfying Strategy-Proofness are rank-order voting and majority rule. In
my thesis, I generalize their result, by proving that rank-order voting and
majority rule are surprisingly still the only voting rules satisfying Weak

election between two candidates, and then each vote is randomly changed with a
small probability, independently of the other votes. It is desirable to keep
the outcome of the election the same, regardless of the changes to the votes.
It is well known that the US electoral college system is about 5 times more
likely to have a changed outcome due to vote corruption, when compared to a
majority vote. In fact, Mossel, O'Donnell and Oleszkiewicz proved in 2005 that
the majority voting method is most stable to this random vote corruption, among
voting methods where each person has a small influence on the election. We
discuss some recent progress on the analogous result for elections between more
than two candidates. In this case, plurality should be most stable to
corruption in votes. We also survey results on adversarial election
manipulation (where an adversary can select particular votes to change, perhaps
in a non-random way), and we briefly discuss ranked choice voting methods

techniques of digital geometry and show that their count varies quadratically
with the radius of the semicircular generatrix. Next, we design an algorithm to
fill these absentee-voxels so as to generate a spherical surface of revolution,
which is more realistic from the viewpoint of visual perception. We further
show that covering a solid sphere by a set of complete spheres also results in
an asymptotically larger count of absentees, which is cubic in the radius of

62,Nurse Staffing under Absenteeism: A Distributionally Robust Optimization Approach,"We study the nurse staffing problem under random nurse demand and
absenteeism. While the demand uncertainty is exogenous (stemming from the
random patient census), the absenteeism uncertainty is \emph{endogenous}, i.e.,
the number of nurses who show up for work partially depends on the nurse
staffing level. For quality of care, many hospitals have developed float pools,
i.e., groups of hospital units, and trained nurses to be able to work in
multiple units (termed cross-training) in response to potential nurse shortage.
In this paper, we propose a distributionally robust nurse staffing (DRNS) model
that considers both exogenous and endogenous uncertainties. We derive a
separation algorithm to solve this model under a general structure of float
pools. In addition, we identify several pool structures that often arise in
practice and recast the corresponding DRNS model as a mixed-integer linear
program, which facilitates off-the-shelf commercial solvers. Furthermore, we
optimize the float pool design to reduce cross-training while achieving
specified target staffing costs. The numerical case studies, based on the data

large portions of ballots coming from absentee voters, RCV election outcomes

proposed approach, edge devices (EDs) transmit the signs of local stochastic

at the edge server (ES) are obtained with non-coherent detectors by exploiting
the accumulations on the resources. Hence, the proposed scheme eliminates the
need for channel state information (CSI) at the EDs and ES. In this study, we
analyze various gradient-encoding strategies through the weight functions and
waveform configurations over orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM).
We show that specific weight functions that enable absentee EDs (i.e.,
hard-coded participation with absentees (HPA)) or weighted votes (i.e.,
soft-coded participation (SP)) can substantially reduce the probability of
detecting the incorrect MV. By taking path loss, power control, cell size, and
fading channel into account, we prove the convergence of the distributed
learning for a non-convex function for HPA. Through simulations, we show that
the proposed scheme with HPA and SP can provide high test accuracy even when

74,A Neural Phillips Curve and a Deep Output Gap,"Many problems plague the estimation of Phillips curves. Among them is the
hurdle that the two key components, inflation expectations and the output gap,
are both unobserved. Traditional remedies include creating reasonable proxies
for the notable absentees or extracting them via some form of assumptions-heavy
filtering procedure. I propose an alternative route: a Hemisphere Neural
Network (HNN) whose peculiar architecture yields a final layer where components
can be interpreted as latent states within a Neural Phillips Curve. There are
benefits. First, HNN conducts the supervised estimation of nonlinearities that
arise when translating a high-dimensional set of observed regressors into
latent states. Second, computations are fast. Third, forecasts are economically
interpretable. Fourth, inflation volatility can also be predicted by merely
adding a hemisphere to the model. Among other findings, the contribution of
real activity to inflation appears severely underestimated in traditional
econometric specifications. Also, HNN captures out-of-sample the 2021 upswing
in inflation and attributes it first to an abrupt and sizable disanchoring of
the expectations component, followed by a wildly positive gap starting from
late 2020. HNN's gap unique path comes from dispensing with unemployment and
GDP in favor of an amalgam of nonlinearly processed alternative tightness

changing slowly towards scenarios in which occupants have more choice and

ramping building operations up and down more rapidly and effectively to the

77,Analyzing two-stage experiments in the presence of interference,"Two-stage randomization is a powerful design for estimating treatment effects
in the presence of interference; that is, when one individual's treatment
assignment affects another individual's outcomes. Our motivating example is a
two-stage randomized trial evaluating an intervention to reduce student
absenteeism in the School District of Philadelphia. In that experiment,
households with multiple students were first assigned to treatment or control;
then, in treated households, one student was randomly assigned to treatment.
Using this example, we highlight key considerations for analyzing two-stage
experiments in practice. Our first contribution is to address additional
complexities that arise when household sizes vary; in this case, researchers
must decide between assigning equal weight to households or equal weight to
individuals. We propose unbiased estimators for a broad class of individual-
and household-weighted estimands, with corresponding theoretical and estimated
variances. Our second contribution is to connect two common approaches for
analyzing two-stage designs: linear regression and randomization inference. We
show that, with suitably chosen standard errors, these two approaches yield
identical point and variance estimates, which is somewhat surprising given the
complex randomization scheme. Finally, we explore options for incorporating
covariates to improve precision. We confirm our analytic results via simulation

78,Variance partitioning in multilevel models for count data,"A first step when fitting multilevel models to continuous responses is to
explore the degree of clustering in the data. Researchers fit
variance-component models and then report the proportion of variation in the
response that is due to systematic differences between clusters. Equally they
report the response correlation between units within a cluster. These
statistics are popularly referred to as variance partition coefficients (VPCs)
and intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs). When fitting multilevel models
to categorical (binary, ordinal, or nominal) and count responses, these
statistics prove more challenging to calculate. For categorical response
models, researchers appeal to their latent response formulations and report
VPCs/ICCs in terms of latent continuous responses envisaged to underly the
observed categorical responses. For standard count response models, however,
there are no corresponding latent response formulations. More generally, there
is a paucity of guidance on how to partition the variation. As a result,
applied researchers are likely to avoid or inadequately report and discuss the
substantive importance of clustering and cluster effects in their studies. A
recent article drew attention to a little-known exact algebraic expression for
the VPC/ICC for the special case of the two-level random-intercept Poisson
model. In this article, we make a substantial new contribution. First, we
derive exact VPC/ICC expressions for more flexible negative binomial models
that allows for overdispersion, a phenomenon which often occurs in practice.
Then we derive exact VPC/ICC expressions for three-level and random-coefficient

contact-tracing, and quarantining are important components of a successful
strategy for containing campus outbreaks. High test specificity is critical for
keeping the size of the quarantine population manageable. Moving the largest
classes online is also crucial for controlling both the size of outbreaks and
the number of students in quarantine. Increased residential exposure can
significantly impact the size of an outbreak, but it is likely more important
to control non-residential social exposure among students. Finally, necessarily
high quarantine rates even in controlled outbreaks imply significant

on transmission eigenchannels of light in highly scattering media. In the weak
absorption regime, the spatial profile of a transmission channel remains very
similar to that without absorption, and the effect of inhomogeneous absorption
can be stronger or weaker than homogeneous absorption depending on the spatial
overlap of the localized absorbing region with the field intensity maximum of
the channel. In the strong absorption regime, the high transmission channels
redirect the energy flows to circumvent the absorbing regions to minimize loss.
The attenuation of high transmission channels by inhomogeneous absorption is
lower than that by homogeneous absorption, regardless of the location of the
absorbing region. The statistical distribution of transmission eigenvalues in
the former becomes broader than that in the latter, due to a longer tail at
high transmission. Since the maximum transmission channel is the most efficient
in bypassing the absorbing region, the ratio of its transmittance to the

enhance the integrated absorption. Random hole position can completely change

efficiency is slightly smaller than the optimized ordered nanohole pattern.
Compared to random positioned nanoholes or ordered nanohole, amorphous

Further, the spacing and design of the cells can be modified to form a pixel
array structure that couples the light falling in the air gaps via evanescent

position of the quantum layers within the device is an additional parameter
that can strongly influence resonant absorption. However, this effect has so
far received little attention from the photovoltaic community. In this work, we

wavelength ($\lambda$) and polarization in a deuterium cluster using molecular
dynamics (MD) simulation. For a given laser energy and a pulse duration
$\approx$ 5-fs (fwhm), it is found that maximum laser absorption does not
happen at the welknown static Mie-resonance or linear resonance (LR) wavelength
of $\lambdaM\approx 263$~nm (for deuterium cluster) irrespective of linear
polarization (LP) and circular polarization (CP) state of laser. As the laser
intensity increases, the absorption peak is gradually red-shifted to a higher
$\lambda$ in the marginally over-dense regime of $\lambda\!\! \approx
\!\!(1\!\!-\!\!1.5)\lambdaM$ from the expected static~$\lambdaM$ owing to
gradual outer ionization and cluster expansion; and above an intensity the
resonance absorption peak disappears (sometimes followed by {\em even} a growth
of absorption) when outer ionization saturates at 100\% for both LP and CP.
This disappearance of the resonance absorption peak should not be
misinterpreted as the negligible (or no) role of Mie-resonance. In fact, in
this marginally over-dense band of $\lambda\!\! \approx
\!\!(1\!\!-\!\!1.5)\lambdaM$, some electrons undergo dynamic Mie-resonance
(dynamic LR) and others anharmonic resonance when they are freed. It is also
found that before the absorption peak, laser absorption due to LP and CP lasers
are almost equally efficient (CP case being inappreciably higher than LP) for
all intensities and $\lambda$. However, after the absorption peak, at lower
intensities, absorption due to LP inappreciably dominates absorption due to CP
with increasing~$\lambda$ which gradually reverses at higher intensities. MD
results are also supported by a naive rigid sphere model of cluster.",1812.10046v1,physics.plasm-ph,2018-12-25 06:05:44+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('S. S. Mahalik'), arxiv.Result.Author('M. Kundu')]",

100,Sets of Half-Average Nulls Generate Risk-Limiting Audits: SHANGRLA,"Risk-limiting audits (RLAs) for many social choice functions can be reduced
to testing sets of null hypotheses of the form ""the average of this list is not
greater than 1/2"" for a collection of finite lists of nonnegative numbers. Such
social choice functions include majority, super-majority, plurality,
multi-winner plurality, Instant Runoff Voting (IRV), Borda count, approval
voting, and STAR-Voting, among others. The audit stops without a full hand
count iff all the null hypotheses are rejected. The nulls can be tested in many
ways. Ballot-polling is particularly simple; two new ballot-polling
risk-measuring functions for sampling without replacement are given.
Ballot-level comparison audits transform each null into an equivalent assertion
that the mean of re-scaled tabulation errors is not greater than 1/2. In turn,
that null can then be tested using the same statistical methods used for ballot
polling---but applied to different finite lists of nonnegative numbers.
SHANGRLA comparison audits are more efficient than previous comparison audits
for two reasons: (i) for most social choice functions, the conditions tested
are both necessary and sufficient for the reported outcome to be correct, while
previous methods tested conditions that were sufficient but not necessary, and
(ii) the tests avoid a conservative approximation. The SHANGRLA abstraction
simplifies stratified audits, including audits that combine ballot polling with
ballot-level comparisons, producing sharper audits than the ""SUITE"" approach.
SHANGRLA works with the ""phantoms to evil zombies"" strategy to treat missing
ballot cards and missing or redacted cast vote records. That also facilitates
sampling from ""ballot-style manifests,"" which can dramatically improve
efficiency when the audited contests do not appear on every ballot card.

101,Limiting Risk by Turning Manifest Phantoms into Evil Zombies,"Drawing a random sample of ballots to conduct a risk-limiting audit generally
requires knowing how the ballots cast in an election are organized into groups,
for instance, how many containers of ballots there are in all and how many
ballots are in each container. A list of the ballot group identifiers along
with number of ballots in each group is called a ballot manifest. What if the
ballot manifest is not accurate? Surprisingly, even if ballots are known to be
missing from the manifest, it is not necessary to make worst-case assumptions
about those ballots--for instance, to adjust the margin by the number of
missing ballots--to ensure that the audit remains conservative. Rather, it
suffices to make worst-case assumptions about the individual randomly selected
ballots that the audit cannot find. This observation provides a simple
modification to some risk-limiting audit procedures that makes them
automatically become more conservative if the ballot manifest has errors. The
modification--phantoms to evil zombies (~2EZ)--requires only an upper bound on
the total number of ballots cast. ~2EZ makes the audit P-value stochastically
larger than it would be had the manifest been accurate, automatically requiring
more than enough ballots to be audited to offset the manifest errors. This
ensures that the true risk limit remains smaller than the nominal risk limit.
On the other hand, if the manifest is in fact accurate and the upper bound on
the total number of ballots equals the total according to the manifest, ~2EZ
has no effect at all on the number of ballots audited nor on the true risk
limit.",1207.3413v1,stat.AP,2012-07-14 11:26:02+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Jorge H. Banuelos'), arxiv.Result.Author('Philip B. Stark')]",

In this study, we altered votes on a voter's ballot after they had made their
selections on a BMD. We then required them to examine their ballots for any
changes from the slate they used to vote. Overall accuracy was exceptionally
high. Participants saw 1440 total contests, and of those 1440, there were a
total of 4 errors, so total accuracy was 99.8%. Participants were able to
perform with near-perfect accuracy regardless of ballot length, ballot type,
number of altered races, and location of altered races. Detection performance
was extremely robust. We conclude that with proper direction and resources,
voters can be near-perfect detectors of ballot changes on printed paper ballots
after voting with a BMD. This finding has significant implications for the
voting community as BMD use continues to grow. Research should now focus on
identifying administrative and behavioral methods that will prompt and

real ballots of any strict subset of districts at a price corresponding to the
willingness to sell on the part of the citizens holding such ballots. By
contrast, decoy voters are trapped into selling their ballots at a low, or even
negligible, price. Blowing up the adversary's budget by introducing decoy

106,The ATHENA Class of Risk-Limiting Ballot Polling Audits,"The main risk-limiting ballot polling audit in use today, BRAVO, is designed
for use when single ballots are drawn at random and a decision regarding
whether to stop the audit or draw another ballot is taken after each ballot
draw (ballot-by-ballot (B2) audits). On the other hand, real ballot polling
audits draw many ballots in a single round before determining whether to stop
(round-by-round (R2) audits). We show that BRAVO results in significant
inefficiency when directly applied to real R2 audits. We present the ATHENA
class of R2 stopping rules, which we show are risk-limiting if the round
schedule is pre-determined (before the audit begins). We prove that each rule
is at least as efficient as the corresponding BRAVO stopping rule applied at
the end of the round. We have open-source software libraries implementing most
of our results.
  We show that ATHENA halves the number of ballots required, for all state
margins in the 2016 US Presidential election and a first round with $90\%$
stopping probability, when compared to BRAVO (stopping rule applied at the end
of the round). We present simulation results supporting the 90% stopping
probability claims and our claims for the risk accrued in the first round.
Further, ATHENA reduces the number of ballots by more than a quarter for low
margins, when compared to the BRAVO stopping rule applied on ballots in
selection order. This implies that keeping track of the order when drawing
ballots R2 is not beneficial, because ATHENA is more efficient even without
information on selection order. These results are significant because current
approaches to real ballot polling election audits use the B2 BRAVO rules,
requiring about twice as much work on the part of election officials. Applying
the rules in selection order requires fewer ballots, but keeping track of the
order, and entering it into audit software, adds to the effort.",2008.02315v5,cs.CR,2020-08-05 18:47:37+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Filip Zagórski'), arxiv.Result.Author('Grant McClearn'), arxiv.Result.Author('Sarah Morin'), arxiv.Result.Author('Neal McBurnett'), arxiv.Result.Author('Poorvi L.

of the correspondence between symDTS operation and an Hermite history. Since
ballot tilings form a subset in the set of symmetric Dyck tilings, we construct
an inclusive map from labeled trees for ballot tilings to labeled trees for
symmetric Dyck tilings. By this inclusive map, the results for symmetric Dyck
tilings can be applied to those of ballot tilings. We introduce and study the

it does not require a ballot manifest; (2) it can be conducted independently at
different locations, rather than requiring a central authority to select the
sample from the whole population of cast ballots or requiring stratified
sampling; (3) it can start in polling places on election night, before margins
are known. If the reported margins for the 2016 U.S. Presidential election are
correct, a Bernoulli ballot-polling audit with a risk limit of 5% and a
sampling rate of $p_0 = 1\%$ would have had at least a 99% probability of

Our method involves doing $k$ ""cuts"", each involving moving a random portion of
ballots from the top to the bottom of the stack, and then picking the ballot on
top. Unlike conventional methods of picking a ballot at random, $k$-cut does
not require identification numbers on the ballots or counting many ballots per
draw. We analyze how close the distribution of chosen ballots is to the uniform

Recent studies (e.g., Bernhard, et al. 2020) suggest the verification rate is

of voters being unable to do so accurately or whether this is because voters
simply choose not to attempt verification in the first place. In order to
understand this problem, we conducted an experiment in which 108 participants
participated in a mock election where the BMD displayed the voters' true
choices, but then changed a subset of those choices on the printed ballot. The
design of the printed ballot, the length of the ballot, the number of changes
that were made to the ballot, the location of those changes, and the
instructions provided to the voters were manipulated as part of the experiment.
Results indicated that of those voters who chose to examine the printed ballot,
76% detected anomalies, indicating that voters can reliably detect errors on

justifiably high confidence that the reported results of an election are
consistent with an audit trail (""ballots""), which can be paper or electronic.
SOBA combines three ideas: (1) publishing cast vote records (CVRs) separately
for each contest, so that anyone can verify that each reported contest outcome
is correct, if the CVRs reflect voters' intentions with sufficient accuracy;
(2) shrouding a mapping between ballots and the CVRs for those ballots to
prevent the loss of privacy that could occur otherwise; (3) assessing the
accuracy with which the CVRs reflect voters' intentions for a collection of
contests while simultaneously assessing the integrity of the shrouded mapping
between ballots and CVRs by comparing randomly selected ballots to the CVRs
that purport to represent them. Step (1) is related to work by the Humboldt
County Election Transparency Project, but publishing CVRs separately for
individual contests rather than images of entire ballots preserves privacy.
Step (2) requires a cryptographic commitment from elections officials.
Observers participate in step (3), which relies on the ""super-simple
simultaneous single-ballot risk-limiting audit."" Step (3) is designed to reveal
relatively few ballots if the shrouded mapping is proper and the CVRs
accurately reflect voter intent. But if the reported outcomes of the contests
differ from the outcomes that a full hand count would show, step (3) is

either they support the recorded result, or they fall back to a full manual

comparison audit compares randomly selected digital ballots with their paper

evidence against or in support of the recorded result. Risk-limiting audits for
first-past-the-post elections are well understood, and used in some US
elections. We define a number of approaches to ballot-polling and comparison
risk-limiting audits for Instant Runoff Voting (IRV) elections. We show that

influence the outcome of an election, given fixed voter preferences. We show
that there exist preference profiles over $k$ candidates such that up to $k-1$
different candidates win at different ballot lengths. We derive exact lower
bounds on the number of voters required for such profiles and provide a
construction matching the lower bound for unrestricted voter preferences.
Additionally, we characterize which sequences of winners are possible over
ballot lengths and provide explicit profile constructions achieving any
feasible winner sequence. We also examine how classic preference restrictions
influence our results--for instance, single-peakedness makes $k-1$ different
winners impossible but still allows at least $\Omega(\sqrt k)$. Finally, we
analyze a collection of 168 real-world elections, where we truncate rankings to
simulate shorter ballots. We find that shorter ballots could have changed the

125,Asymptotic Collusion-Proofness of Voting Rules: The Case of Large Number of Candidates,"Classical results in voting theory show that strategic manipulation by voters
is inevitable if a voting rule simultaneously satisfy certain desirable
properties. Motivated by this, we study the relevant question of how often a
voting rule is manipulable. It is well known that elections with a large number
of voters are rarely manipulable under impartial culture (IC) assumption.
However, the manipulability of voting rules when the number of candidates is
large has hardly been addressed in the literature and our paper focuses on this
problem. First, we propose two properties (1) asymptotic strategy-proofness and
(2) asymptotic collusion-proofness, with respect to new voters, which makes the
two notions more relevant from the perspective of computational problem of
manipulation. In addition to IC, we explore a new culture of society where all
score vectors of the candidates are equally likely. This new notion has its
motivation in computational social choice and we call it impartial scores
culture (ISC) assumption. We study asymptotic strategy-proofness and asymptotic
collusion-proofness for plurality, veto, $k$-approval, and Borda voting rules
under IC as well as ISC assumptions. Specifically, we prove bounds for the
fraction of manipulable profiles when the number of candidates is large. Our
results show that the size of the coalition and the tie-breaking rule play a
crucial role in determining whether or not a voting rule satisfies the above
two properties.",1305.5053v2,cs.GT,2013-05-22 08:58:24+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Palash Dey'), arxiv.Result.Author('Y. Narahari')]",

performing that case of control is computationally infeasible. Range Voting is
a natural extension of approval voting, and Normalized Range Voting is a simple
variant which alters each vote to maximize the potential impact of each voter.
We show that Normalized Range Voting has among the largest number of control

127,"Aggregation over Metric Spaces: Proposing and Voting in Elections, Budgeting, and Legislation","We present a unifying framework encompassing many social choice settings.
Viewing each social choice setting as voting in a suitable metric space, we
consider a general model of social choice over metric spaces, in
which---similarly to the spatial model of elections---each voter specifies an
ideal element of the metric space. The ideal element functions as a vote, where
each voter prefers elements that are closer to her ideal element. But it also
functions as a proposal, thus making all participants equal not only as voters
but also as proposers. We consider Condorcet aggregation and a continuum of
solution concepts, ranging from minimizing the sum of distances to minimizing
the maximum distance.
  We study applications of the abstract model to various social choice
settings, including single-winner elections, committee elections, participatory
budgeting, and participatory legislation. For each setting, we compare each
solution concept to known voting rules and study various properties of the
resulting voting rules. Our framework provides expressive aggregation for a
broad range of social choice settings while remaining simple for voters, and
may enable a unified and integrated implementation for all these settings, as
well as unified extensions such as sybil-resiliency, proxy voting, and
deliberative decision making.",1806.06277v4,cs.MA,2018-06-16 18:50:19+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Laurent Bulteau'), arxiv.Result.Author('Gal Shahaf'), arxiv.Result.Author('Ehud Shapiro'), arxiv.Result.Author('Nimrod Talmon')]",
128,Strategic Voting Under Uncertainty About the Voting Method,"Much of the theoretical work on strategic voting makes strong assumptions
about what voters know about the voting situation. A strategizing voter is
typically assumed to know how other voters will vote and to know the rules of
the voting method. A growing body of literature explores strategic voting when
there is uncertainty about how others will vote. In this paper, we study
strategic voting when there is uncertainty about the voting method. We
introduce three notions of manipulability for a set of voting methods: sure,
safe, and expected manipulability. With the help of a computer program, we
identify voting scenarios in which uncertainty about the voting method may
reduce or even eliminate a voter's incentive to misrepresent her preferences.
Thus, it may be in the interest of an election designer who wishes to reduce
strategic voting to leave voters uncertain about which of several reasonable
voting methods will be used to determine the winners of an election.",1907.09110v1,cs.MA,2019-07-22 03:17:19+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Wesley H. Holliday'), arxiv.Result.Author('Eric Pacuit')]","EPTCS 297, 2019, pp. 252-272"

compare it with conventional voting. Typical examples for vote delegation are
validation or governance tasks on blockchains. There is a majority of
well-behaving agents, but they may abstain or delegate their vote to other
agents since voting is costly. Misbehaving agents always vote. We compare
conventional voting allowing for abstention with vote delegation. Preferences
of voters are private information and a positive outcome is achieved if
well-behaving agents win. We illustrate that vote delegation leads to quite
different outcomes than conventional voting with abstention. In particular, we
obtain three insights: First, if the number of misbehaving voters, denoted by f
, is high, both voting methods fail to deliver a positive outcome. Second, if f
takes an intermediate value, conventional voting delivers a positive outcome,
while vote delegation fails with probability one. Third, if f is low,
delegation delivers a positive outcome with higher probability than
conventional voting. Finally, our results characterize worst-case outcomes that
can happen in a liquid democracy.",2102.08823v2,cs.GT,2021-02-17 15:32:32+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Hans Gersbach'), arxiv.Result.Author('Akaki Mamageishvili'), arxiv.Result.Author('Manvir Schneider')]",
130,The Complexity of Online Bribery in Sequential Elections (Extended Abstract),"Prior work on the complexity of bribery assumes that the bribery happens
simultaneously, and that the briber has full knowledge of all voters' votes.
But neither of those assumptions always holds. In many real-world settings,
votes come in sequentially, and the briber may have a use-it-or-lose-it moment
to decide whether to bribe/alter a given vote, and at the time of making that
decision, the briber may not know what votes remaining voters are planning on
casting.
  In this paper, we introduce a model for, and initiate the study of, bribery
in such an online, sequential setting. We show that even for election systems
whose winner-determination problem is polynomial-time computable, an online,
sequential setting may vastly increase the complexity of bribery, in fact
jumping the problem up to completeness for high levels of the polynomial
hierarchy or even PSPACE. On the other hand, we show that for some natural,
important election systems, such a dramatic complexity increase does not occur,
and we pinpoint the complexity of their bribery problems in the online,
sequential setting.",1907.09108v1,cs.GT,2019-07-22 03:16:55+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Edith Hemaspaandra'), arxiv.Result.Author('Lane A. Hemaspaandra'), arxiv.Result.Author('Jörg Rothe')]","EPTCS 297, 2019, pp. 233-251"

implementations have received increasing attention. Unfortunately, existing BFT
consensus protocols that are the backbone of permissioned blockchains, either
scale poorly or offer limited throughput. Most of these algorithms require at
least one process to receive and validate the votes from all other processes
and then broadcast the result, which is inherently non-scalable. Some
algorithms avoid this bottleneck by using aggregation trees to collect and
validate votes. However, to the best of our knowledge, such algorithms offer
limited throughput and degrade quickly in the presence of faults. In this paper
we propose \thesystem, the first BFT communication abstraction that organizes
participants in a tree to perform scalable vote aggregation and that, in faulty
runs, is able to terminate the protocol within an optimal number of
reconfigurations ($f+1$). We define precisely which aggregation trees allow for
optimal reconfiguration and show that, unlike previous protocols, when using
these configurations, \thesystem scales to large number of processes and
outperforms HotStuff's throughput by up to 38x.",2103.12112v1,cs.DC,2021-03-22 18:15:04+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Ray Neiheiser'), arxiv.Result.Author('Miguel Matos'), arxiv.Result.Author('Luís Rodrigues')]",

since the 17th century. However, these mechanisms raise concerns about
fairness, privacy, vote concealment, fair calculations of tally, and proxies

electronic voting via electronic voting machines (EVMs) improves fairness by
relying on centralized trust. Homomorphic encryption-based voting protocols
also assure fairness but cannot scale to large scale elections such as
presidential elections. In this paper, we leverage the blockchain technology of
distributing trust to propose a smart contract-based protocol, namely, \proto.
There are many existing protocols for voting using smart contracts. We observe
that these either are not scalable or leak the vote tally during the voting
stage, i.e., do not provide vote concealment. In contrast, we show that FASTEN
preserves voter's privacy ensures vote concealment, immutability, and avoids
double voting. We prove that the probability of privacy breaches is negligibly
small. Further, our cost analysis of executing FASTEN over Ethereum is

We study three of the most common methods used to modify voting rules to deal
with such partial votes. These methods modify scoring rules (like the Borda
count), elimination style rules (like single transferable vote) and rules based
on the tournament graph (like Copeland) respectively. We argue that with an
elimination style voting rule like single transferable vote, partial voting
does not change the situations where strategic voting is possible. However,
with scoring rules and rules based on the tournament graph, partial voting can
increase the situations where strategic voting is possible. As a consequence,
the computational complexity of computing a strategic vote can change. For
example, with Borda count, the complexity of computing a strategic vote can
decrease or stay the same depending on how we score partial votes.",1405.7714v1,cs.GT,2014-05-28 12:13:52+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Nina Narodytska'), arxiv.Result.Author('Toby Walsh')]",
135,Verification of the Socio-Technical Aspects of Voting: The Case of the Polish Postal Vote 2020,"Voting procedures are designed and implemented by people, for people, and
with significant human involvement. Thus, one should take into account the
human factors in order to comprehensively analyze properties of an election and
detect threats. In particular, it is essential to assess how actions and
strategies of the involved agents (voters, municipal office employees, mail
clerks) can influence the outcome of other agents' actions as well as the
overall outcome of the election. In this paper, we present our first attempt to
capture those aspects in a formal multi-agent model of the Polish presidential
election 2020. The election marked the first time when postal vote was
universally available in Poland. Unfortunately, the voting scheme was prepared
under time pressure and political pressure, and without the involvement of
experts. This might have opened up possibilities for various kinds of ballot
fraud, in-house coercion, etc. We propose a preliminary scalable model of the
procedure in the form of a Multi-Agent Graph, and formalize selected integrity
and security properties by formulas of agent logics. Then, we transform the
models and formulas so that they can be input to the state-of-art model checker
Uppaal. The first series of experiments demonstrates that verification scales
rather badly due to the state-space explosion. However, we show that a recently

136,Reputation-Driven Voting Dynamics,"We introduce the reputational voter model (RVM) to account for the
time-varying abilities of individuals to influence their neighbors. To
understand of the RVM, we first discuss the fitness voter model (FVM), in which
each voter has a fixed and distinct fitness. In a voting event where voter $i$
is fitter than voter $j$, only $j$ changes opinion. We show that the dynamics
of the FVM and the voter model are identical. We next discuss the adaptive
voter model (AVM), in which the influencing voter in a voting event increases
its fitness by a fixed amount. The dynamics of the AVM is non-stationary and
slowly crosses over to that of FVM because of the gradual broadening of the
fitness distribution of the population. Finally, we treat the RVM, in which the
voter $i$ is endowed with a reputational rank $r_i$ that ranges from 1 (highest
rank) to $N$ (lowest), where $N$ is the population size. In a voting event in
which voter $i$ outranks $j$, only the opinion of $j$ changes. Concomitantly,
the rank of $i$ increases, while that of $j$ does not change. The rank
distribution remains uniform on the integers $1,2,3,\ldots,N$, leading to
stationary dynamics. For equal number of voters in the two voting states with
these two subpopulations having the same average rand, the time to reach
consensus in the mean-field limit scales as $\exp(\sqrt{N})$. This long
consensus time arises because the average rank of the minority population is
typically higher than that of the majority. Thus whenever consensus is
approached, this highly ranked minority tends to drive the population away from
consensus.",1902.09371v2,physics.soc-ph,2019-02-22 18:19:16+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('D. Bhat'), arxiv.Result.Author('S. Redner')]",J. Stat. Mech. (2019) 063208
137,Exploring Weak Strategy-Proofness in Voting Theory,"Voting is the aggregation of individual preferences in order to select a
winning alternative. Selection of a winner is accomplished via a voting rule,
e.g., rank-order voting, majority rule, plurality rule, approval voting. Which
voting rule should be used? In social choice theory, desirable properties of
voting rules are expressed as axioms to be satisfied. This thesis focuses on
axioms concerning strategic manipulation by voters. Sometimes, voters may
intentionally misstate their true preferences in order to alter the outcome for
their own advantage. For example, in plurality rule, if a voter knows that
their top-choice candidate will lose, then they might instead vote for their
second-choice candidate just to avoid an even less desirable result. When no
coalition of voters can strategically manipulate, then the voting rule is said
to satisfy the axiom of Strategy-Proofness. A less restrictive axiom is Weak
Strategy-Proofness (as defined by Dasgupta and Maskin (2019)), which allows for
strategic manipulation by all but the smallest coalitions. Under certain
intuitive conditions, Dasgupta and Maskin (2019) proved that the only voting
rules satisfying Strategy-Proofness are rank-order voting and majority rule. In
my thesis, I generalize their result, by proving that rank-order voting and
majority rule are surprisingly still the only voting rules satisfying Weak
Strategy-Proofness.",2005.07521v1,econ.TH,2020-05-13 19:53:08+00:00,[arxiv.Result.Author('Anne Carlstein')],

interference by third parties. For example, suppose votes have been cast in an
election between two candidates, and then each vote is randomly changed with a
small probability, independently of the other votes. It is desirable to keep
the outcome of the election the same, regardless of the changes to the votes.
It is well known that the US electoral college system is about 5 times more
likely to have a changed outcome due to vote corruption, when compared to a
majority vote. In fact, Mossel, O'Donnell and Oleszkiewicz proved in 2005 that
the majority voting method is most stable to this random vote corruption, among
voting methods where each person has a small influence on the election. We
discuss some recent progress on the analogous result for elections between more
than two candidates. In this case, plurality should be most stable to
corruption in votes. We also survey results on adversarial election
manipulation (where an adversary can select particular votes to change, perhaps
in a non-random way), and we briefly discuss ranked choice voting methods

luminosity ranges or having different morphological types are different. These
characteristics or `marks' permit to understand the galaxy catalogs that carry
all this information as realizations of marked point processes. Many attempts
have been presented to quantify the dependence of the clustering of galaxies on
their inner properties. The present paper summarizes methods on spatial marked
statistics used in cosmology to disentangle luminosity, colour or morphological
segregation and introduces a new one in this context, the mark connection
function. The methods used here are the partial correlation functions,
including the cross-correlation function, the normalised mark correlation
function, the mark variogram and the mark connection function. All these
methods are applied to a volume-limited sample drawn from the 2dFGRS, using the
spectral type as the mark. We show the virtues of each method to provide
information about the clustering properties of each population, the dependence
of the clustering on the marks, the similarity of the marks as a function of
the pair distances, and the way to characterise the spatial correlation between
the marks. We demonstrate by means of these statistics that passive galaxies
exhibit stronger spatial correlation than active galaxies at small scales (r
<20 Mpc/h). The mark connection function, introduced here, is particularly
useful for understanding the spatial correlation between the marks.",1001.1294v1,astro-ph.CO,2010-01-08 14:59:39+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Vicent J.

141,Statistical learning of geometric characteristics of wireless networks,"Motivated by the prediction of cell loads in cellular networks, we formulate
the following new, fundamental problem of statistical learning of geometric
marks of point processes: An unknown marking function, depending on the
geometry of point patterns, produces characteristics (marks) of the points. One
aims at learning this function from the examples of marked point patterns in
order to predict the marks of new point patterns. To approximate (interpolate)
the marking function, in our baseline approach, we build a statistical
regression model of the marks with respect some local point distance
representation. In a more advanced approach, we use a global data
representation via the scattering moments of random measures, which build
informative and stable to deformations data representation, already proven
useful in image analysis and related application domains. In this case, the
regression of the scattering moments of the marked point patterns with respect
to the non-marked ones is combined with the numerical solution of the inverse
problem, where the marks are recovered from the estimated scattering moments.
Considering some simple, generic marks, often appearing in the modeling of
wireless networks, such as the shot-noise values, nearest neighbour distance,
and some characteristics of the Voronoi cells, we show that the scattering
moments can capture similar geometry information as the baseline approach, and
can reach even better performance, especially for non-local marking functions.
Our results motivate further development of statistical learning tools for
stochastic geometry and analysis of wireless networks, in particular to predict
cell loads in cellular networks from the locations of base stations and traffic

prerequisite for the creation of maps with high precision, necessary for
autonomous driving, infrastructure monitoring, lane-wise traffic management,
and urban planning. Lane markings are one of the important components of such
maps. Lane markings convey the rules of roads to drivers. While these rules are
learned by humans, an autonomous driving vehicle should be taught to learn them
to localize itself. Therefore, accurate and reliable lane marking semantic
segmentation in the imagery of roads and highways is needed to achieve such
goals. We use airborne imagery which can capture a large area in a short period
of time by introducing an aerial lane marking dataset. In this work, we propose
a Symmetric Fully Convolutional Neural Network enhanced by Wavelet Transform in
order to automatically carry out lane marking segmentation in aerial imagery.
Due to a heavily unbalanced problem in terms of number of lane marking pixels
compared with background pixels, we use a customized loss function as well as a
new type of data augmentation step. We achieve a very high accuracy in
pixel-wise localization of lane markings without using 3rd-party information.

height process to our L\'evy processes with marked jumps. Assuming that the

161,Flexible Attribute-Based Encryption Applicable to Secure E-Healthcare Records,"In e-healthcare record systems (EHRS), attribute-based encryption (ABE)

such a way that all users are associated with specific access policies and only
the ciphertexts matching the users' access policies can be decrypted. An issue
with KP-ABE is that it requires an a priori formulation of access policies
during key generation, which is not always practicable in EHRS because the
policies to access health records are sometimes determined after key
generation. In this paper, we revisit KPABE and propose a dynamic ABE paradigm,
referred to as access policy redefinable ABE (APR-ABE). To address the above
issue, APR-ABE allows users to redefine their access policies and delegate keys
for the redefined ones; hence a priori precise policies are no longer

162,Automated Verification Of Role-Based Access Control Policies Constraints Using Prover9,"Access control policies are used to restrict access to sensitive records for
authorized users only. One approach for specifying policies is using role based
access control (RBAC) where authorization is given to roles instead of users.
Users are assigned to roles such that each user can access all the records that
are allowed to his/her role. RBAC has a great interest because of its
flexibility. One issue in RBAC is dealing with constraints. Usually, policies
should satisfy pre-defined constraints as for example separation of duty (SOD)
which states that users are not allowed to play two conflicting roles.
Verifying the satisfiability of constraints based on policies is time consuming
and may lead to errors. Therefore, an automated verification is essential. In
this paper, we propose a theory for specifying policies and constraints in
first order logic. Furthermore, we present a comprehensive list of constraints.
We identity constraints based on the relation between users and roles, between
roles and permission on records, between users and permission on records, and
between users, roles, and permission on records. Then, we use a general purpose
theorem prover tool called Prover9 for proving the satisfaction of constraints.",1503.07645v1,cs.CR,2015-03-26 08:31:44+00:00,[arxiv.Result.Author('Khair Eddin Sabri')],
163,Explanation-Based Auditing,"To comply with emerging privacy laws and regulations, it has become common
for applications like electronic health records systems (EHRs) to collect
access logs, which record each time a user (e.g., a hospital employee) accesses
a piece of sensitive data (e.g., a patient record). Using the access log, it is
easy to answer simple queries (e.g., Who accessed Alice's medical record?), but
this often does not provide enough information. In addition to learning who
accessed their medical records, patients will likely want to understand why
each access occurred. In this paper, we introduce the problem of generating
explanations for individual records in an access log. The problem is motivated
by user-centric auditing applications, and it also provides a novel approach to
misuse detection. We develop a framework for modeling explanations which is
based on a fundamental observation: For certain classes of databases, including
EHRs, the reason for most data accesses can be inferred from data stored
elsewhere in the database. For example, if Alice has an appointment with Dr.
Dave, this information is stored in the database, and it explains why Dr. Dave
looked at Alice's record. Large numbers of data accesses can be explained using
general forms called explanation templates. Rather than requiring an
administrator to manually specify explanation templates, we propose a set of
algorithms for automatically discovering frequent templates from the database
(i.e., those that explain a large number of accesses). We also propose
techniques for inferring collaborative user groups, which can be used to
enhance the quality of the discovered explanations. Finally, we have evaluated
our proposed techniques using an access log and data from the University of
Michigan Health System. Our results demonstrate that in practice we can provide
explanations for over 94% of data accesses in the log.",1109.6880v1,cs.DB,2011-09-30 16:24:41+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Daniel Fabbri'), arxiv.Result.Author('Kristen LeFevre')]","Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment (PVLDB), Vol. 5, No. 1, pp. 1-12

databases without a common identifier. MINDFIRL (MInimum Necessary Disclosure

tradeoff between utility and privacy in interactive record linkage. Due to the
need to access personally identifiable information (PII) to accurately assess
whether different records refer to the same person in heterogeneous databases,
privacy is a major concern in interactive record linkage. MINDFIRL supports
interactive record linkage while minimizing the privacy risk by (1) using
pseudonyms to separate the identifying information from the sensitive
information, (2) dynamically disclosing only the minimum necessary information
incrementally, as needed on-demand at the point of decision, and (3) quantifies
the risk due to the needed information disclosure to support transparency, the
reasoning, communication, and decisions on the privacy and utility trade off.
In this paper we present an overview of the MINDFIRL system and the

networks. We also propose minibatch averaging to efficiently avoid mode
collapse, and increase the learning efficiency with batch normalization and
shortcut connections. To demonstrate feasibility, we showed that medGAN

173,Are Attribute Inference Attacks Just Imputation?,"Models can expose sensitive information about their training data. In an
attribute inference attack, an adversary has partial knowledge of some training

of attribute inference we call \emph{sensitive value inference}, where the
adversary's goal is to identify with high confidence some records from a
candidate set where the unknown attribute has a particular sensitive value. We
explicitly compare attribute inference with data imputation that captures the
training distribution statistics, under various assumptions about the training
data available to the adversary. Our main conclusions are: (1) previous
attribute inference methods do not reveal more about the training data from the
model than can be inferred by an adversary without access to the trained model,
but with the same knowledge of the underlying distribution as needed to train
the attribute inference attack; (2) black-box attribute inference attacks
rarely learn anything that cannot be learned without the model; but (3)
white-box attacks, which we introduce and evaluate in the paper, can reliably
identify some records with the sensitive value attribute that would not be
predicted without having access to the model. Furthermore, we show that
proposed defenses such as differentially private training and removing
vulnerable records from training do not mitigate this privacy risk. The code

177,StreamBox-HBM: Stream Analytics on High Bandwidth Hybrid Memory,"Stream analytics have an insatiable demand for memory and performance.
Emerging hybrid memories combine commodity DDR4 DRAM with 3D-stacked High
Bandwidth Memory (HBM) DRAM to meet such demands. However, achieving this
promise is challenging because (1) HBM is capacity-limited and (2) HBM boosts
performance best for sequential access and high parallelism workloads. At first
glance, stream analytics appear a particularly poor match for HBM because they
have high capacity demands and data grouping operations, their most demanding
computations, use random access. This paper presents the design and
implementation of StreamBox-HBM, a stream analytics engine that exploits hybrid
memories to achieve scalable high performance. StreamBox-HBM performs data
grouping with sequential access sorting algorithms in HBM, in contrast to
random access hashing algorithms commonly used in DRAM. StreamBox-HBM solely
uses HBM to store Key Pointer Array (KPA) data structures that contain only
partial records (keys and pointers to full records) for grouping operations. It
dynamically creates and manages prodigious data and pipeline parallelism,

178,Providing More Efficient Access To Government Records: A Use Case Involving Application of Machine Learning to Improve FOIA Review for the Deliberative Process Privilege,"At present, the review process for material that is exempt from disclosure
under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) in the United States of America,
and under many similar government transparency regimes worldwide, is entirely
manual. Public access to the records of their government is thus inhibited by
the long backlogs of material awaiting such reviews. This paper studies one
aspect of that problem by first creating a new public test collection with
annotations for one class of exempt material, the deliberative process
privilege, and then by using that test collection to study the ability of
current text classification techniques to identify those materials that are
exempt from release under that privilege. Results show that when the system is
trained and evaluated using annotations from the same reviewer that even
difficult cases can often be reliably detected, but that differences in
reviewer interpretations, differences in record custodians, and that
differences in topics of the records used for training and testing pose
additional challenges.",2011.07203v1,cs.IR,2020-11-14 02:56:49+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Jason R. Baron'), arxiv.Result.Author('Mahmoud F. Sayed'), arxiv.Result.Author('Douglas W. Oard')]",
179,Combining IOTA and Attribute-Based Encryption for Access Control in the Internet of Things,"Unauthorized resource access represents a typical security threat in the
Internet of things (IoT), while distributed ledger technologies (e.g.,
blockchain and IOTA) hold great promise to address this threat. Although
blockchain-based IoT access control schemes have been the most popular ones,
they suffer from several significant limitations, such as high monetary cost
and low throughput of processing access requests. To overcome these
limitations, this paper proposes a novel IoT access control scheme by combining
the fee-less IOTA technology and the Ciphertext-Policy Attribute-Based
Encryption (CP-ABE) technology. To control the access to a resource, a token,
which records access permissions to this resource, is encrypted by the CP-ABE
technology and uploaded to the IOTA Tangle (i.e., the underlying database of
IOTA). Any user can fetch the encrypted token from the Tangle, while only those
who can decrypt this token are authorized to access the resource. In this way,
the proposed scheme enables not only distributed, fee-less and scalable access
control thanks to the IOTA but also fine-grained attribute-based access control
thanks to the CP-ABE. We show the feasibility of our scheme by implementing a
proof-of-concept prototype system and evaluate its performance in terms of
access request processing throughput.",2103.04016v1,cs.CR,2021-03-06 03:19:23+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Ruka Nakanishi'), arxiv.Result.Author('Yuanyu Zhang'), arxiv.Result.Author('Masahiro Sasabe'), arxiv.Result.Author('Shoji Kasahara')]",

A web survey and a web content analysis were conducted as the methods to elicit
data on web accessibility. Factors preventing accessibility were hypothesized
as an initial experiment. Affecting design elements are identified through web
content analysis, the results of which are utilized to develop specific
implications for improving web accessibility. The hypothesis tests show that
there is no significant correlation between accessibility and geographical or

visual and mobility impaired users experience poor accessibility. Poor
readability and less navigable page designs are two observable issues, which
pose threats to accessibility. The lack of conformance to W3C accessibility

189,Throughput of CDM-based Random Access With SINR Capture,"Code division multiplexing (CDM)-based random access is used in many
practical wireless systems. With CDM-based random access, a set of sequences is
reserved for random access. A remote station transmits a random access packet
using a randomly selected sequence among the set. If more than one remote
stations transmit random access packets using the same sequence simultaneously,
performance degrades due to sequence collision. In addition, if more than one
remote stations transmit random access packets using different sequences
simultaneously, performance also degrades due to interference. Therefore, the
performance of CDM-based random access is dependent on both sequence collision
and interference. There has been no previous research to analyze the
performance of CDM-based random access considering both sequence collision and
interference. In this paper, throughput of CDM-based random access is
investigated considering both sequence collision and interference based on a
signal to interference plus noise ratio (SINR) capture model. Analysis and
numerical simulation compare the throughputs of several random access schemes
including conventional and channel-adaptive random access. The results show
that channel-adaptive random access can achieve significantly higher throughput
than conventional random access. In addition, based on the results of this
paper, it is possible to analyze the trade-off between the throughput and
implementation complexity with increased number of sequences.",1910.04941v1,eess.SP,2019-10-11 02:20:14+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Hoesang Choi'), arxiv.Result.Author('Hichan Moon')]",

authorization requests that can be processed or the structure of the
authorization policies that can be specified. In this paper, we develop a
formal characterization of the features of an access control model that imposes
few restrictions of this nature. Our characterization is intended to be a
generic framework for access control, from which we may derive access control
models and reason about the properties of those models. In this paper, we
consider the properties of monotonicity and completeness, the first being
particularly important for attribute-based access control systems. XACML, an
XML-based language and architecture for attribute-based access control, is
neither monotonic nor complete. Using our framework, we define attribute-based

and calculates the trust and reputation score of each participating node to
achieve a self-adaptive and trustworthy access control system. Trust and
reputation are explicitly incorporated in the attribute-based access control
policy, so that different nodes can be assigned to different access right
levels, resulting in dynamic access control policies. We implement our proposed

Station (BS) for power saving, random access procedure is required for devices
to transmit data. If many devices try random access simultaneously, preamble
collision problem occurs, thus causing latency increase. In an environment
where delay-sensitive and delay-tolerant devices coexist, the contention-based
random access procedure cannot satisfy latency requirements of delay-sensitive
devices. Therefore, we propose RAPID, a novel random access procedure, which is
completed through two message exchanges for the delay-sensitive devices. We
also develop Access Pattern Analyzer (APA), which estimates traffic
characteristics of MTC devices. When UEs, performing RAPID and contention-based
random access, coexist, it is important to determine a value which is the
number of preambles for RAPID to reduce random access load. Thus, we analyze
random access load using a Markov chain model to obtain the optimal number of
preambles for RAPID. Simulation results show RAPID achieves 99.999% reliability
with 80.8% shorter uplink latency, and also decreases random access load by

194,Inward and Outward Node Accessibility in Complex Networks as Revealed by Non-Linear Dynamics,"In this work, the outward and inward accessibilities of individual nodes are
defined and their potential for application is illustrated with respect to the
investigation of 6 different types of networks. The outward accessibility
quantifies the potential of an individual node for accessing other nodes
through random walks. The inward accessibility measures the potential of a
given node of being accessed by other nodes. Both the inward and outward
accessibilities are measured with respect to successive time steps along the
walks, providing an interesting means for the characterization of the transient
non-linear dynamics of accessibility. Self-avoiding walks are considered here
because they are more purposive and necessarily finite (unlike traditional
random walks). The results include the identification of the fact that the
inward values tend to be much smaller than the outward values, the tendency of
the inward accessibility to be highly correlated with the node degree while the
outward values are mostly uncorrelated with that measurements, the distinct
behavior of the accessibility in geographical networks, the dominance of hubs
in scale free networks, as well as the enhanced uniformity of the
accessibilities for the path-regular model. Also investigated was the
possibility to predict the accessibility of a given node in terms of its
respective degree. The concepts of inward and outward accessibility, as well as

the many new challenges arising in this setting, the most relevant are: the
fundamental limits of communication from a massive number of bursty devices
transmitting simultaneously with short packets, the design of low complexity
and energy-efficient massive access coding and communication schemes, efficient
methods for the detection of a relatively small number of active users among a
large number of potential user devices with sporadic transmission pattern, and

197,Access Structures Determined by Uniform Polymatroids,"An access structure is said to be multipartite, if the set of participants is
divided into several parts and all participants in the same part play an
equivalent role. The search for ideal secret sharing schemes for some special
interesting families of multipartite access structures, has been carried out by
many authors. In this paper a new concept of study of ideal access structures
is proposed. We do not consider special classes of access structures defined by
imposing certain prescribed assumptions, but we investigate all access
structures obtained from uniform polymatroids using the method developed by
Farr\`as, Mart\'i-Farr\'e and Padr\'o. They satisfy necessary condition to be
ideal, i.e., they are matroid ports. Moreover some objects in this family can
be useful for the applications of secret sharing. The choice of uniform
polymatroids is motivated by the fact that each such polymatroid defines ideal
access structures. The method presented in this article is universal and can be
continued with other classes of polymatroids in further similar studies. Here
we are especially interested in hierarchy of participants determined by the
access structure and we distinguish two main classes: they are compartmented
and hierarchical access structures. The vast majority of papers discussing
hierarchical access structures consider access structures which are compartment
or totally hierarchical. The main results are summarized in Section 4, which
presents situations where partial hierarchy properties may arise. In
particular, hierarchical orders of obtained structures are described. It is
surprising, that the hierarchical orders of access structures obtained from
uniform polymatroids are flat, i.e., every chain has at most 2 elements. The

multiple IP cores have concurrent access to on-chip shared resources. In
security-critical applications, IP cores have different privilege levels for
accessing shared resources, which must be regulated by an access control
system. AKER is a design and verification framework for SoC access control.
AKER builds upon the Access Control Wrapper (ACW) -- a high performance and
easy-to-integrate hardware module that dynamically manages access to shared
resources. To build an SoC access control system, AKER distributes the ACWs
throughout the SoC, wrapping controller IP cores, and configuring the ACWs to
perform local access control. To ensure the access control system is
functioning correctly and securely, AKER provides a property-driven security
verification using MITRE common weakness enumerations. AKER verifies the SoC
access control at the IP level to ensure the absence of bugs in the
functionalities of the ACW module, at the firmware level to confirm the secure
operation of the ACW when integrated with a hardware root-of-trust (HRoT), and
at the system level to evaluate security threats due to the interactions among
shared resources. The performance, resource usage, and security of access
control systems implemented through AKER is experimentally evaluated on a
Xilinx UltraScale+ programmable SoC, it is integrated with the OpenTitan
hardware root-of-trust, and it is used to design an access control system for

providing confidentiality and fine-grained access control in the cloud-based
area. However, due to high computational overhead, common ABE schemes are not
suitable for resource-constrained devices. Moreover, data owners should be able
to update their defined access policies efficiently, and in some cases,
applying hidden access policies is required to preserve the privacy of clients
and data. In this paper, we propose a ciphertext-policy attribute-based access
control scheme which for the first time provides online/offline encryption,
hidden access policy, and access policy update simultaneously. In our scheme,
resource-constrained devices are equipped with online/offline encryption
reducing the encryption overhead significantly. Furthermore, attributes of
access policies are hidden such that the attribute sets satisfying an access
policy cannot be guessed by other parties. Moreover, data owners can update
their defined access policies while outsourcing a major part of the updating
process to the cloud service provider. In particular, we introduce blind access
policies that enable the cloud service provider to update the data owners'
access policies without receiving a new re-encryption key. Besides, our scheme
supports fast decryption such that the decryption algorithm consists of a
constant number of bilinear pairing operations. The proposed scheme is proven
to be secure in the random oracle model and under the hardness of Decisional
Bilinear Diffie-Hellman (DBDH) and Decision Linear (D-Linear) assumptions.
