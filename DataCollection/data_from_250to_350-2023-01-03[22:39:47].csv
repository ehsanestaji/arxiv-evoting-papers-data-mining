reconstruction are discussed: total differential method, extreme values method,
Gauss statistical method, and Monte Carlo simulation method. The methods are

1,New simultaneous methods for finding all zeros of a polynomial,"The purpose of this paper is to present three new methods for finding all
simple zeros of polynomials simultaneously. First, we give a new method for
finding simultaneously all simple zeros of polynomials constructed by applying
the Weierstrass method to the zero in the trapezoidal Newton's method, and
prove the convergence of the method. We also present two modified Newton's
methods combined with the derivative-free method, which are constructed by
applying the derivative-free method to the zero in the trapezoidal Newton's
method and the midpoint Newton's method, respectively. Finally, we give a
numerical comparison between various simultaneous methods for finding zeros of
a polynomial.",1501.05033v1,math.NA,2015-01-21 02:10:04+00:00,[arxiv.Result.Author('Jun-Seop Song')],"Journal of Mathematical Sciences: Advances and Applications 33

2,Counting methods introduced into the bibliometric research literature 1970-2018: A review,"The present review of bibliometric counting methods investigates 1) the
number of unique counting methods in the bibliometric research literature, 2)
to what extent the counting methods can be categorized according to selected
characteristics of the counting methods, 3) methods and elements to assess the
internal validity of the counting methods, and 4) to what extent and with which
characteristics the counting methods are used in research evaluations.
  The review identifies 32 counting methods introduced during the period 1981 -
2018. Two frameworks categorize these counting methods. Framework 1 describes
selected mathematical properties of counting methods, and Framework 2 describes
arguments for choosing a counting method. Twenty of the 32 counting methods are
rank-dependent, fractionalized, and introduced to measure contribution,
participation, etc. of an object of study. Next, three criteria for internal
validity are used to identify five methods that test the adequacy of counting
methods, two elements that test sensitivity, and three elements that test
homogeneity of the counting methods. These methods and elements may be used to
assess the internal validity of counting methods. Finally, a literature search
finds research evaluations that use the counting methods. Only three of the 32
counting methods are used by four research evaluations or more. Of these three
counting methods, two are used with the same characteristics as defined in the
studies that introduced the counting methods.
  The review provides practitioners in research evaluation and researchers in
bibliometrics with a detailed foundation for working with counting methods. At
the same time, many of the findings in the review provide bases for future
investigations of counting methods.",2012.04986v1,cs.DL,2020-12-09 11:29:35+00:00,[arxiv.Result.Author('Marianne Gauffriau')],
3,Numerical Methods for the Stray-Field Calculation: A Comparison of recently developed Algorithms,"Different numerical approaches for the stray-field calculation in the context
of micromagnetic simulations are investigated. We compare finite difference
based fast Fourier transform methods, tensor grid methods and the
finite-element method with shell transformation in terms of computational
complexity, storage requirements and accuracy tested on several benchmark
problems. These methods can be subdivided into integral methods (fast Fourier
transform methods, tensor-grid method) which solve the stray field directly and
in differential equation methods (finite-element method), which compute the
stray field as the solution of a partial differential equation. It turns out
that for cuboid structures the integral methods, which work on cuboid grids
(fast Fourier transform methods and tensor grid methods) outperform the
finite-element method in terms of the ratio of computational effort to
accuracy. Among these three methods the tensor grid method is the fastest.
However, the use of the tensor grid method in the context of full micromagnetic
codes is not well investigated yet. The finite-element method performs best for
computations on curved structures.",1204.4302v1,physics.comp-ph,2012-04-19 10:06:28+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Claas Abert'), arxiv.Result.Author('Lukas Exl'), arxiv.Result.Author('Gunnar Selke'), arxiv.Result.Author('André Drews'), arxiv.Result.Author('Thomas Schrefl')]",
4,The standard forms of the Kaczmarz-Tanabe type methods and their convergence theory,"In this paper, we consider the standard form of two kinds of Kaczmarz-Tanabe
type methods, one derived from the Kaczmarz method and the other derived from
the symmetric Kaczmarz method. As a famous image reconstruction method in
computed tomography, the Kaczmarz method has both advantage and disadvantage.
The advantage are simple and easy to implement, while the disadvantages are
slow convergence speed, and the symmetric Kaczmarz method is the same. For the
standard form of this method, once the iterative matrix is generated, it can be
used continuously in the subsequent iterations. Moreover, the iterative matrix
can be stored in the image reconstructive devices, which makes the Kaczmarz
method and the symmetric Kaczmarz method can be used like the simultaneous
iterative reconstructive techniques (SIRT). Meanwhile, theoretical analysis
shows that the convergence rate of symmetric Kaczmarz method is better than the
Kaczmarz method but is slightly worse than that of two iterations Kaczmarz
method, which is verified numerically. Numerical experiments also show that the
convergence rates of the Kaczmarz method and the symmetric Kaczmarz method are
better than the SIRT methods and slightly worse than CGMN method in some cases.
However, the Kaczmarz Tanabe type methods have better problem adaptability.",2211.00328v1,math.NA,2022-11-01 08:31:08+00:00,[arxiv.Result.Author('Chuan-gang Kang')],

7,Preconditioning Kaczmarz method by sketching,"We propose a new method for preconditioning Kaczmarz method by sketching.
Kaczmarz method is a stochastic method for solving overdetermined linear
systems based on a sampling of matrix rows. The standard approach to speed up
convergence of iterative methods is using preconditioner. As we show the best
possible preconditioner for this method can be constructed from QR
decomposition of the system matrix, but the complexity of this procedure is too
high. Therefore, to reduce this complexity, we use random sketching and compare
it with the Kaczmarz method without preconditioning. The developed method is
applicable for different modifications of classical Kaczmarz method that were
proposed recently. We provide numerical experiments to show the performance of
the developed methods on solving both random and real overdetermined linear
systems.",1903.01806v1,cs.NA,2019-03-05 13:11:08+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Alexandr Katrutsa'), arxiv.Result.Author('Ivan Oseledets')]",
8,A Two-Point Newton Method suitable for non-convergent Cases and with Super-Quadratic Convergence,"An iterative formula based on Newton Method alone is presented for the
iterative solutions of equations that ensures convergence in cases where the
traditional Newton Method may fail to converge to the desired root. In
addition, the method has super quadratic convergence of order 2.414. Newton
method is said to fail in certain cases leading to oscillation, divergence to
increasingly large number or off-shooting away to another root further from the
desired domain or off shooting to an invalid domain where the function may not
be defined. In addition when the derivative at the iteration point is zero,
Newton method stalls. In most of these cases, hybrids of several methods such
as Newton, bisection and secant methods are suggested as substitute methods and
Newton method is essentially blended with other methods or altogether
abandoned. This paper argues that a solution is still possible in most of these
cases by the application of Newton Method alone without resorting to other
methods and with the same computational effort, two functional evaluations per
iteration, like the traditional Newton method. In addition, the proposed
modified formula based on Newton method has better convergence characteristics

20,Bernoulli Ballot Polling: A Manifest Improvement for Risk-Limiting Audits,"We present a method and software for ballot-polling risk-limiting audits

it does not require a ballot manifest; (2) it can be conducted independently at
different locations, rather than requiring a central authority to select the
sample from the whole population of cast ballots or requiring stratified
sampling; (3) it can start in polling places on election night, before margins
are known. If the reported margins for the 2016 U.S. Presidential election are
correct, a Bernoulli ballot-polling audit with a risk limit of 5% and a
sampling rate of $p_0 = 1\%$ would have had at least a 99% probability of
confirming the outcome in 42 states. (The other states were more likely to have
needed to examine additional ballots.) Logistical and security advantages that
auditing in the polling place affords may outweigh the cost of examining more
ballots than some other methods might require.",1812.06361v1,stat.AP,2018-12-15 21:57:23+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Kellie Ottoboni'), arxiv.Result.Author('Matthew Bernhard'), arxiv.Result.Author('J.

21,SOBA: Secrecy-preserving Observable Ballot-level Audit,"SOBA is an approach to election verification that provides observers with
justifiably high confidence that the reported results of an election are
consistent with an audit trail (""ballots""), which can be paper or electronic.
SOBA combines three ideas: (1) publishing cast vote records (CVRs) separately
for each contest, so that anyone can verify that each reported contest outcome
is correct, if the CVRs reflect voters' intentions with sufficient accuracy;
(2) shrouding a mapping between ballots and the CVRs for those ballots to
prevent the loss of privacy that could occur otherwise; (3) assessing the
accuracy with which the CVRs reflect voters' intentions for a collection of
contests while simultaneously assessing the integrity of the shrouded mapping
between ballots and CVRs by comparing randomly selected ballots to the CVRs
that purport to represent them. Step (1) is related to work by the Humboldt
County Election Transparency Project, but publishing CVRs separately for
individual contests rather than images of entire ballots preserves privacy.
Step (2) requires a cryptographic commitment from elections officials.
Observers participate in step (3), which relies on the ""super-simple
simultaneous single-ballot risk-limiting audit."" Step (3) is designed to reveal
relatively few ballots if the shrouded mapping is proper and the CVRs
accurately reflect voter intent. But if the reported outcomes of the contests
differ from the outcomes that a full hand count would show, step (3) is
guaranteed to have a large chance of requiring all the ballots to be counted by
hand, thereby limiting the risk that an incorrect outcome will become official
and final.",1105.5803v2,stat.AP,2011-05-29 17:00:20+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Josh Benaloh'), arxiv.Result.Author('Douglas Jones'), arxiv.Result.Author('Eric Lazarus'), arxiv.Result.Author('Mark Lindeman'), arxiv.Result.Author('Philip B. Stark')]",
22,RAIRE: Risk-Limiting Audits for IRV Elections,"Risk-limiting post election audits guarantee a high probability of correcting
incorrect election results, independent of why the result was incorrect.
Ballot-polling audits select ballots at random and interpret those ballots as
evidence for and against the reported result, continuing this process until
either they support the recorded result, or they fall back to a full manual
recount. For elections with digitised scanning and counting of ballots, a
comparison audit compares randomly selected digital ballots with their paper
versions. Discrepancies are referred to as errors, and are used to build
evidence against or in support of the recorded result. Risk-limiting audits for
first-past-the-post elections are well understood, and used in some US
elections. We define a number of approaches to ballot-polling and comparison
risk-limiting audits for Instant Runoff Voting (IRV) elections. We show that
for almost all real elections we found, we can perform a risk-limiting audit by
looking at only a small fraction of the total ballots (assuming no errors were
made in the tallying and distribution of votes).",1903.08804v2,cs.DS,2019-03-20 06:19:10+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Michelle Blom'), arxiv.Result.Author('Peter J. Stuckey'), arxiv.Result.Author('Vanessa Teague')]",
23,"More style, less work: card-style data decrease risk-limiting audit sample sizes","U.S. elections rely heavily on computers such as voter registration
databases, electronic pollbooks, voting machines, scanners, tabulators, and
results reporting websites. These introduce digital threats to election
outcomes. Risk-limiting audits (RLAs) mitigate threats to some of these systems
by manually inspecting random samples of ballot cards. RLAs have a large chance
of correcting wrong outcomes (by conducting a full manual tabulation of a
trustworthy record of the votes), but can save labor when reported outcomes are
correct. This efficiency is eroded when sampling cannot be targeted to ballot
cards that contain the contest(s) under audit. If the sample is drawn from all
cast cards, RLA sample sizes scale like the reciprocal of the fraction of
ballot cards that contain the contest(s) under audit. That fraction shrinks as
the number of cards per ballot grows (i.e., when elections contain more
contests) and as the fraction of ballots that contain the contest decreases
(i.e., when a smaller percentage of voters are eligible to vote in the
contest). States that conduct RLAs of contests on multi-card ballots or of
small contests can dramatically reduce sample sizes by using information about
which ballot cards contain which contests -- by keeping track of card-style
data (CSD). For instance, CSD reduces the expected number of draws needed to
audit a single countywide contest on a 4-card ballot by 75%. Similarly, CSD
reduces the expected number of draws by 95% or more for an audit of two
contests with the same margin on a 4-card ballot if one contest is on every
ballot and the other is on 10% of ballots. In realistic examples, the savings
can be several orders of magnitude.",2012.03371v1,cs.CR,2020-12-06 20:35:12+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Amanda K. Glazer'), arxiv.Result.Author('Jacob V. Spertus'), arxiv.Result.Author('Philip B. Stark')]",
24,Non(c)esuch Ballot-Level Risk-Limiting Audits for Precinct-Count Voting Systems,"Risk-limiting audits (RLAs) guarantee a high probability of correcting
incorrect reported outcomes before the outcomes are certified. The most
efficient use ballot-level comparison, comparing the voting system's
interpretation of individual ballot cards sampled at random (cast-vote records,
CVRs) from a trustworthy paper trail to a human interpretation of the same
cards. Such comparisons require the voting system to create and export CVRs in
a way that can be linked to the individual ballots the CVRs purport to
represent. Such links can be created by keeping the ballots in the order in
which they are scanned or by printing a unique serial number on each ballot.
But for precinct-count systems (PCOS), these strategies may compromise vote
anonymity: the order in which ballots are cast may identify the voters who cast
them. Printing a unique pseudo-random number (""cryptographic nonce"") on each
ballot card after the voter last touches it could reduce such privacy risks.
But what if the system does not in fact print a unique number on each ballot or
does not accurately report the numbers it printed? This paper gives two ways to
conduct an RLA so that even if the system does not print a genuine nonce on
each ballot or misreports the nonces it used, the audit's risk limit is not
compromised (however, the anonymity of votes might be compromised). One method
allows untrusted technology to be used to imprint and to retrieve ballot cards.
The method is adaptive: if the technology behaves properly, this protection
does not increase the audit workload. But if the imprinting or retrieval system
misbehaves, the sample size the RLA requires to confirm the reported results
when the results are correct is generally larger than if the imprinting and
retrieval were accurate.",2207.01362v1,cs.CR,2022-07-04 12:35:42+00:00,[arxiv.Result.Author('Philip B. Stark')],
25,Adaptive Risk-Limiting Ballot Comparison Audits,"Risk-limiting audits (RLAs) are rigorous statistical procedures meant to
detect invalid election results. RLAs examine paper ballots cast during the
election to statistically assess the possibility of a disagreement between the
winner determined by the ballots and the winner reported by tabulation. The
most ballot efficient approaches proceed by ""ballot comparison."" However,
ballot comparison requires an untrusted declaration of the contents of each
cast ballot, rather than a simple tabulation of vote totals. This ""cast-vote
record table"" (CVR) is then spot-checked against ballots for consistency. In
many practical settings, the cost of generating a suitable CVR dominates the
cost of conducting the audit, preventing widespread adoption of these
sample-efficient techniques.
  We introduce a new RLA procedure: an ""adaptive ballot comparison"" audit. In
this audit, a global CVR is never produced; instead, a three-stage procedure is
iterated:
  1) a batch is selected,
  2) a CVR is produced for that batch, and
  3) a ballot within the batch is sampled, inspected by auditors, and compared
with the CVR.
  We prove that such an audit can achieve risk commensurate with standard
comparison audits while generating a fraction of the CVR. We present three main
contributions:
  1) a formal adversarial model for RLAs;
  2) definition and analysis of an adaptive audit procedure with rigorous risk
limits and an associated correctness analysis accounting for the incidental
errors arising in typical audits; and
  3) an analysis of practical efficiency.
  This method can be organized in rounds (as is typical for comparison audits)
where sampled CVRs are produced in parallel. Using data from Florida's 2020
presidential election with 5% risk and 1% margin, only 22% of the CVR is
generated; at 10% margin, only 2% is generated.",2202.02607v5,cs.CR,2022-02-05 18:04:27+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Benjamin Fuller'), arxiv.Result.Author('Abigail Harrison'), arxiv.Result.Author('Alexander Russell')]",
26,Sets of Half-Average Nulls Generate Risk-Limiting Audits: SHANGRLA,"Risk-limiting audits (RLAs) for many social choice functions can be reduced
to testing sets of null hypotheses of the form ""the average of this list is not
greater than 1/2"" for a collection of finite lists of nonnegative numbers. Such
social choice functions include majority, super-majority, plurality,
multi-winner plurality, Instant Runoff Voting (IRV), Borda count, approval
voting, and STAR-Voting, among others. The audit stops without a full hand
count iff all the null hypotheses are rejected. The nulls can be tested in many
ways. Ballot-polling is particularly simple; two new ballot-polling
risk-measuring functions for sampling without replacement are given.
Ballot-level comparison audits transform each null into an equivalent assertion
that the mean of re-scaled tabulation errors is not greater than 1/2. In turn,
that null can then be tested using the same statistical methods used for ballot
polling---but applied to different finite lists of nonnegative numbers.
SHANGRLA comparison audits are more efficient than previous comparison audits
for two reasons: (i) for most social choice functions, the conditions tested
are both necessary and sufficient for the reported outcome to be correct, while
previous methods tested conditions that were sufficient but not necessary, and
(ii) the tests avoid a conservative approximation. The SHANGRLA abstraction
simplifies stratified audits, including audits that combine ballot polling with
ballot-level comparisons, producing sharper audits than the ""SUITE"" approach.
SHANGRLA works with the ""phantoms to evil zombies"" strategy to treat missing
ballot cards and missing or redacted cast vote records. That also facilitates
sampling from ""ballot-style manifests,"" which can dramatically improve
efficiency when the audited contests do not appear on every ballot card.
Open-source software implementing SHANGRLA ballot-level comparison audits is

modification preserves the original safety and liveness guarantees of Paxos. We

28,Limiting Risk by Turning Manifest Phantoms into Evil Zombies,"Drawing a random sample of ballots to conduct a risk-limiting audit generally
requires knowing how the ballots cast in an election are organized into groups,
for instance, how many containers of ballots there are in all and how many
ballots are in each container. A list of the ballot group identifiers along
with number of ballots in each group is called a ballot manifest. What if the
ballot manifest is not accurate? Surprisingly, even if ballots are known to be
missing from the manifest, it is not necessary to make worst-case assumptions
about those ballots--for instance, to adjust the margin by the number of
missing ballots--to ensure that the audit remains conservative. Rather, it
suffices to make worst-case assumptions about the individual randomly selected
ballots that the audit cannot find. This observation provides a simple
modification to some risk-limiting audit procedures that makes them
automatically become more conservative if the ballot manifest has errors. The
modification--phantoms to evil zombies (~2EZ)--requires only an upper bound on
the total number of ballots cast. ~2EZ makes the audit P-value stochastically
larger than it would be had the manifest been accurate, automatically requiring
more than enough ballots to be audited to offset the manifest errors. This
ensures that the true risk limit remains smaller than the nominal risk limit.
On the other hand, if the manifest is in fact accurate and the upper bound on
the total number of ballots equals the total according to the manifest, ~2EZ
has no effect at all on the number of ballots audited nor on the true risk
limit.",1207.3413v1,stat.AP,2012-07-14 11:26:02+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Jorge H. Banuelos'), arxiv.Result.Author('Philip B. Stark')]",

permutations avoiding $132$ and $312$ with left factors of Dyck paths. In

30,Can Voters Detect Errors on Their Printed Ballots? Absolutely,"There is still debate on whether voters can detect malicious changes in their
printed ballot after making their selections on a Ballot Marking Device (BMD).
In this study, we altered votes on a voter's ballot after they had made their
selections on a BMD. We then required them to examine their ballots for any
changes from the slate they used to vote. Overall accuracy was exceptionally
high. Participants saw 1440 total contests, and of those 1440, there were a
total of 4 errors, so total accuracy was 99.8%. Participants were able to
perform with near-perfect accuracy regardless of ballot length, ballot type,
number of altered races, and location of altered races. Detection performance
was extremely robust. We conclude that with proper direction and resources,
voters can be near-perfect detectors of ballot changes on printed paper ballots
after voting with a BMD. This finding has significant implications for the
voting community as BMD use continues to grow. Research should now focus on
identifying administrative and behavioral methods that will prompt and
encourage voters to check their BMD-generated ballots before they drop them in

malevolent adversary trying to buy real ballots. If the citizenry is divided
into subgroups (or districts), the adversary can construct a so-called ""Devil's
Menu"" consisting of several prices. In equilibrium, the adversary can buy the
real ballots of any strict subset of districts at a price corresponding to the
willingness to sell on the part of the citizens holding such ballots. By
contrast, decoy voters are trapped into selling their ballots at a low, or even
negligible, price. Blowing up the adversary's budget by introducing decoy
ballots may thus turn out to be futile. The Devil's Menu can also be applied to
the well-known ""Lemons Problem"".",1712.05477v1,cs.GT,2017-12-14 23:54:58+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Hans Gersbach'), arxiv.Result.Author('Akaki Mamageishvili'), arxiv.Result.Author('Oriol Tejada')]",
33,The ATHENA Class of Risk-Limiting Ballot Polling Audits,"The main risk-limiting ballot polling audit in use today, BRAVO, is designed
for use when single ballots are drawn at random and a decision regarding
whether to stop the audit or draw another ballot is taken after each ballot
draw (ballot-by-ballot (B2) audits). On the other hand, real ballot polling
audits draw many ballots in a single round before determining whether to stop
(round-by-round (R2) audits). We show that BRAVO results in significant
inefficiency when directly applied to real R2 audits. We present the ATHENA
class of R2 stopping rules, which we show are risk-limiting if the round
schedule is pre-determined (before the audit begins). We prove that each rule
is at least as efficient as the corresponding BRAVO stopping rule applied at
the end of the round. We have open-source software libraries implementing most
of our results.
  We show that ATHENA halves the number of ballots required, for all state
margins in the 2016 US Presidential election and a first round with $90\%$
stopping probability, when compared to BRAVO (stopping rule applied at the end
of the round). We present simulation results supporting the 90% stopping
probability claims and our claims for the risk accrued in the first round.
Further, ATHENA reduces the number of ballots by more than a quarter for low
margins, when compared to the BRAVO stopping rule applied on ballots in
selection order. This implies that keeping track of the order when drawing
ballots R2 is not beneficial, because ATHENA is more efficient even without
information on selection order. These results are significant because current
approaches to real ballot polling election audits use the B2 BRAVO rules,
requiring about twice as much work on the part of election officials. Applying
the rules in selection order requires fewer ballots, but keeping track of the
order, and entering it into audit software, adds to the effort.",2008.02315v5,cs.CR,2020-08-05 18:47:37+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Filip Zagórski'), arxiv.Result.Author('Grant McClearn'), arxiv.Result.Author('Sarah Morin'), arxiv.Result.Author('Neal McBurnett'), arxiv.Result.Author('Poorvi L.

trees for symmetric Dyck tilings: symmetric Dyck tiling strip (symDTS) and
symmetric Dyck tiling ribbon (symDTR). We give two definitions of Hermite
histories for symmetric Dyck tilings, and show that they are equivalent by use
of the correspondence between symDTS operation and an Hermite history. Since
ballot tilings form a subset in the set of symmetric Dyck tilings, we construct
an inclusive map from labeled trees for ballot tilings to labeled trees for
symmetric Dyck tilings. By this inclusive map, the results for symmetric Dyck
tilings can be applied to those of ballot tilings. We introduce and study the

Our method involves doing $k$ ""cuts"", each involving moving a random portion of
ballots from the top to the bottom of the stack, and then picking the ballot on
top. Unlike conventional methods of picking a ballot at random, $k$-cut does
not require identification numbers on the ballots or counting many ballots per

while BAs are based on Bayesian inference. Until recently, the two have been
thought of as fundamentally different.
  We present results that unify and shed light upon 'ballot-polling' RLAs and
BAs (which only require the ability to sample uniformly at random from all cast
ballot cards) for two-candidate plurality contests, which are building blocks
for auditing more complex social choice functions, including some preferential
voting systems. We highlight the connections between the methods and explore
their performance.
  First, building on a previous demonstration of the mathematical equivalence
of classical and Bayesian approaches, we show that BAs, suitably calibrated,
are risk-limiting. Second, we compare the efficiency of the methods across a
wide range of contest sizes and margins, focusing on the distribution of sample
sizes required to attain a given risk limit. Third, we outline several ways to

Recent studies (e.g., Bernhard, et al. 2020) suggest the verification rate is
low. What is not clear from previous research is whether this is more a result
of voters being unable to do so accurately or whether this is because voters
simply choose not to attempt verification in the first place. In order to
understand this problem, we conducted an experiment in which 108 participants
participated in a mock election where the BMD displayed the voters' true
choices, but then changed a subset of those choices on the printed ballot. The
design of the printed ballot, the length of the ballot, the number of changes
that were made to the ballot, the location of those changes, and the
instructions provided to the voters were manipulated as part of the experiment.
Results indicated that of those voters who chose to examine the printed ballot,
76% detected anomalies, indicating that voters can reliably detect errors on
their ballot if they will simply review it. This suggests that administrative

38,ALPHA: Audit that Learns from Previously Hand-Audited Ballots,"BRAVO, the most widely tried method for risk-limiting election audits, cannot
accommodate sampling without replacement or stratified sampling, which can
improve efficiency and may be required by law. It applies only to
ballot-polling audits, which are less efficient than comparison audits. It
applies to plurality, majority, super-majority, proportional representation,
and ranked-choice voting contests, but not to many social choice functions for
which there are RLA methods, such as approval voting, STAR-voting, Borda count,
and general scoring rules. And while BRAVO has the smallest expected sample
size among sequentially valid ballot-polling-with-replacement methods when
reported vote shares are exactly right, it can require arbitrarily large
samples when the reported reported winner(s) really won but reported vote
shares are wrong. ALPHA is a simple generalization of BRAVO that (i) works for
sampling with and without replacement and Bernoulli sampling; (ii) increases
power for stratified audits by avoiding the need to use a $P$-value combining
function or to maximize $P$-values over nuisance parameters within strata, and
allowing adaptive sampling across strata; (iii) works not only for
ballot-polling but also for ballot-level comparison, batch-polling, and
batch-level comparison audits, sampling with or without replacement, uniformly
or with weights proportional to size; (iv) works for all social choice
functions covered by SHANGRLA; and (v) in situations where both ALPHA and BRAVO
apply, requires smaller samples than BRAVO when the reported vote shares are
wrong but the outcome is correct--five orders of magnitude in some examples.
ALPHA includes the family of betting martingale tests in RiLACS, with a
different betting strategy parametrized as an estimator of the population mean

40,Positionality-Weighted Aggregation Methods for Cumulative Voting,"Respecting minority opinions is vital in solving social problems. However,
minority opinions are often ignored in general majority rules. To build
consensus on pluralistic values and make social choices that consider minority
opinions, we propose aggregation methods that give weighting to the minority's
positionality on cardinal cumulative voting. Based on quadratic and linear
voting, we formulated three weighted aggregation methods that differ in the
ratio of votes to cumulative points and the weighting of the minority to all
members, and assuming that the distributions of votes follow normal
distributions, we calculated the frequency distributions of the aggregation
results. We found that minority opinions are more likely to be reflected
proportionately to the average of the distribution in two of the above three
methods. This implies that Sen and Gotoh's idea of considering the social
position of unfortunate people on ordinal ranking in the welfare economics, was
illustrated by weighting the minority's positionality on cardinal voting. In
addition, it is possible to visualize the number and positionality of the
minority from the analysis of the aggregation results. These results will be
useful to promote mutual understanding between the majority and minority by
interactively visualizing the contents of the proposed aggregation methods in
the consensus-building process. With the further development of information
technology, the consensus building based on big data will be necessary. We
recommend the use of our proposed aggregation methods to make social choices

41,Exact Scale Invariance in Mixing of Binary Candidates in Voting Model,"We introduce a voting model and discuss the scale invariance in the mixing of
candidates. The Candidates are classified into two categories $\mu\in \{0,1\}$
and are called as `binary' candidates. There are in total $N=N_{0}+N_{1}$
candidates, and voters vote for them one by one. The probability that a
candidate gets a vote is proportional to the number of votes. The initial
number of votes (`seed') of a candidate $\mu$ is set to be $s_{\mu}$. After
infinite counts of voting, the probability function of the share of votes of
the candidate $\mu$ obeys gamma distributions with the shape exponent $s_{\mu}$
in the thermodynamic limit $Z_{0}=N_{1}s_{1}+N_{0}s_{0}\to \infty$. Between the
cumulative functions $\{x_{\mu}\}$ of binary candidates, the power-law relation
$1-x_{1} \sim (1-x_{0})^{\alpha}$ with the critical exponent
$\alpha=s_{1}/s_{0}$ holds in the region $1-x_{0},1-x_{1}<<1$. In the double
scaling limit $(s_{1},s_{0})\to (0,0)$ and $Z_{0} \to \infty$ with
$s_{1}/s_{0}=\alpha$ fixed, the relation $1-x_{1}=(1-x_{0})^{\alpha}$ holds

racehorses are mixed on the win bet fraction axis. We see the emergence of a
scale invariant relation between the cumulative distribution function of the
winning horse $x_{1}$ and that of the losing horse $x_{0}$. $x_{1}\propto
x_{0}^{\alpha}$ holds in the small win bet fraction region. We also see the
efficiency of the market as the vote proceeds. However, the convergence to the
efficient state is not monotonic. The time change of the distribution of a vote
is complicated. Votes resume concentration on popular horses, after the
distribution spreads to a certain extent. In order to explain scale invariance,
we introduce a simple voting model. In a `double' scaling limit, we show that
the exact scale invariance relation $x_{1}=x_{0}^{\alpha}$ holds over the

52,Strategic Voting Under Uncertainty About the Voting Method,"Much of the theoretical work on strategic voting makes strong assumptions
about what voters know about the voting situation. A strategizing voter is
typically assumed to know how other voters will vote and to know the rules of
the voting method. A growing body of literature explores strategic voting when
there is uncertainty about how others will vote. In this paper, we study
strategic voting when there is uncertainty about the voting method. We
introduce three notions of manipulability for a set of voting methods: sure,
safe, and expected manipulability. With the help of a computer program, we
identify voting scenarios in which uncertainty about the voting method may
reduce or even eliminate a voter's incentive to misrepresent her preferences.
Thus, it may be in the interest of an election designer who wishes to reduce
strategic voting to leave voters uncertain about which of several reasonable
voting methods will be used to determine the winners of an election.",1907.09110v1,cs.MA,2019-07-22 03:17:19+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Wesley H. Holliday'), arxiv.Result.Author('Eric Pacuit')]","EPTCS 297, 2019, pp. 252-272"

compare it with conventional voting. Typical examples for vote delegation are
validation or governance tasks on blockchains. There is a majority of
well-behaving agents, but they may abstain or delegate their vote to other
agents since voting is costly. Misbehaving agents always vote. We compare
conventional voting allowing for abstention with vote delegation. Preferences
of voters are private information and a positive outcome is achieved if
well-behaving agents win. We illustrate that vote delegation leads to quite
different outcomes than conventional voting with abstention. In particular, we
obtain three insights: First, if the number of misbehaving voters, denoted by f
, is high, both voting methods fail to deliver a positive outcome. Second, if f
takes an intermediate value, conventional voting delivers a positive outcome,
while vote delegation fails with probability one. Third, if f is low,
delegation delivers a positive outcome with higher probability than
conventional voting. Finally, our results characterize worst-case outcomes that
can happen in a liquid democracy.",2102.08823v2,cs.GT,2021-02-17 15:32:32+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Hans Gersbach'), arxiv.Result.Author('Akaki Mamageishvili'), arxiv.Result.Author('Manvir Schneider')]",

count), elimination style rules (like single transferable vote) and rules based
on the tournament graph (like Copeland) respectively. We argue that with an
elimination style voting rule like single transferable vote, partial voting
does not change the situations where strategic voting is possible. However,
with scoring rules and rules based on the tournament graph, partial voting can
increase the situations where strategic voting is possible. As a consequence,
the computational complexity of computing a strategic vote can change. For
example, with Borda count, the complexity of computing a strategic vote can
decrease or stay the same depending on how we score partial votes.",1405.7714v1,cs.GT,2014-05-28 12:13:52+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Nina Narodytska'), arxiv.Result.Author('Toby Walsh')]",

distributing trust to propose a smart contract-based protocol, namely, \proto.
There are many existing protocols for voting using smart contracts. We observe
that these either are not scalable or leak the vote tally during the voting
stage, i.e., do not provide vote concealment. In contrast, we show that FASTEN
preserves voter's privacy ensures vote concealment, immutability, and avoids
double voting. We prove that the probability of privacy breaches is negligibly

winning alternative. Selection of a winner is accomplished via a voting rule,

voting rule should be used? In social choice theory, desirable properties of
voting rules are expressed as axioms to be satisfied. This thesis focuses on
axioms concerning strategic manipulation by voters. Sometimes, voters may
intentionally misstate their true preferences in order to alter the outcome for
their own advantage. For example, in plurality rule, if a voter knows that
their top-choice candidate will lose, then they might instead vote for their
second-choice candidate just to avoid an even less desirable result. When no
coalition of voters can strategically manipulate, then the voting rule is said
to satisfy the axiom of Strategy-Proofness. A less restrictive axiom is Weak
Strategy-Proofness (as defined by Dasgupta and Maskin (2019)), which allows for
strategic manipulation by all but the smallest coalitions. Under certain
intuitive conditions, Dasgupta and Maskin (2019) proved that the only voting
rules satisfying Strategy-Proofness are rank-order voting and majority rule. In
my thesis, I generalize their result, by proving that rank-order voting and
majority rule are surprisingly still the only voting rules satisfying Weak

It is well known that the US electoral college system is about 5 times more

prediction at intersections. Given some prior knowledge of the curbside
geometry, the presented framework can accurately predict pedestrian
trajectories, even in new intersections that it has not been trained on. This
is achieved by making use of the contravariant components of trajectories in
the curbside coordinate system, which ensures that the transformation of
trajectories across intersections is affine, regardless of the curbside
geometry. Our method is based on the Augmented Semi Nonnegative Sparse Coding
(ASNSC) formulation and we use that as a baseline to show improvement in
prediction performance on real pedestrian datasets collected at two
intersections in Cambridge, with distinctly different curbside and crosswalk
geometries. We demonstrate a 7.2% improvement in prediction accuracy in the
case of same train and test intersections. Furthermore, we show a comparable
prediction performance of TASNSC when trained and tested in different

meeting a city's diverse needs, performance-based pricing schemes have received
a significant amount of attention. However, several recent studies suggest
location, time-of-day, and awareness of policies are the primary factors that
drive parking decisions. In light of this, we provide an extensive data-driven
study of the spatio-temporal characteristics of curbside parking. This work
advances the understanding of where and when to set pricing policies, as well
as where to target information and incentives to drivers looking to park.
Harnessing data provided by the Seattle Department of Transportation, we
develop a Gaussian mixture model based technique to identify zones with similar
spatial parking demand as quantified by spatial autocorrelation. In support of
this technique, we introduce a metric based on the repeatability of our
Gaussian mixture model to investigate temporal consistency.",1712.01263v1,stat.AP,2017-12-02 21:09:56+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Tanner Fiez'), arxiv.Result.Author('Lillian Ratliff')]",

parking meters, paid curbside parking can be advantageously modeled as a
network of interdependent queues. In this article we introduce methods for
analyzing a special class of networks of finite capacity queues, where tasks
arrive from an exogenous source, join the queue if there is an available server
or are rejected and move to another queue in search of service according to the
network topology. Such networks can be useful for modeling curbside parking
since queues in the network perform the same function and drivers searching for
an available server are under combinatorial constraints and jockeying is not
instantaneous. Further, we provide a motivating example for such networks of
finite capacity queues in the context of drivers searching for parking in the
neighborhood of Belltown in Seattle, Washington, USA. Lastly, since the
stationary distribution of such networks used to model parking are difficult to
satisfactorily characterize, we also introduce a simulation tool for the
purpose of testing the assumptions made to estimate interesting performance
metrics. Our results suggest that a Markovian relaxation of the problem when
solving for the mean rate metrics is comparable to deterministic service times
reflective of a driver's tendency to park for the maximum allowable time.",1702.06156v3,cs.CY,2017-02-20 19:56:58+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Chase Dowling'), arxiv.Result.Author('Tanner Fiez'), arxiv.Result.Author('Lillian Ratliff'), arxiv.Result.Author('Baosen Zhang')]",
63,Optimization of bus scheduling and bus-berth matching at curbside stops under connected vehicle environment,"It is commonly seen that buses are blocked by the ones in front serving
passengers and have to queue outside a curbside bus stop although there are
vacant berths at the stop. The resultant bus delays degrade the service level
of urban public transportation. A potential solution is to reschedule the
arrivals of the buses at the stop for full utilization of the berths with the
aid of connected vehicle technologies. This study proposes a mixed-integer
linear programming model to optimize the scheduling of bus arrivals and the
bus-berth matching at a curbside stop under connected vehicle environment. The
objective is the minimization of the bus delays weighted by the number of
passengers on the buses. Bus arrival times at the stop and the assignment of
berths are optimized together with bus departure times from the stop. Bus
punctuality is also taken into consideration. The proposed model could be
applied dynamically to cater to time-varying traffic conditions. Numerical
studies validate the advantages of the proposed model over the
first-come-first-service strategy and the relaxed model without bus punctuality
in terms of weighted bus delays and bus punctuality. Sensitivity analyses show
that: 1) the proposed model is robust to the fluctuation of bus service time;
and 2) a smaller number of berths may be preferred on condition that the bus
demand does not exceed the stop capacity.",2106.11551v2,math.OC,2021-06-22 05:37:11+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Wanjing Ma'), arxiv.Result.Author('Shiqi Ou'), arxiv.Result.Author('Chunhui Yu')]",

customer rejection due to the lack of available servers. We provide conditions
for such networks to be stable, a computationally tractable ""single node"" view

of such queues, and subject to constraints on the allowable congestion between
queues searching for an available server, is a convex optimization problem. We

programming. In the second method, we employ Dantzig-Wolfe decomposition to

77,"Voting power and Qualified Majority Voting with a ""no vote"" option","In recent years, enlargement of the European Union has led to increased
interest in the allocation of voting weights to member states with hugely
differing population numbers. While the eventually agreed voting scheme lacks
any strict mathematical basis, the Polish government suggested a voting scheme
based on the Penrose definition of voting power, leading to an allocation of
voting weights proportional to the square root of the population (the
""Jagiellonian Compromise""). The Penrose definition of voting power is derived
from the citizens' freedom to vote either ""yes"" or ""no"". This paper defines a

78,Transparent Voting Platform Based on Permissioned Blockchain,"Since 2004, different research was handling the challenges in the centralized
voting systems, e-voting protocols and recently the decentralized voting. So
electronic voting puts forward some difficulties regarding the voter anonymity,
the secure casting of the votes and to prevent the voting process from
frauding. The Decentralized property of the technology called ""blockchain""
could have the solution for many of the challenges in voting research area and
brings a new secure mechanism of safe and transparent voting. In this paper, a
broad comparison between ongoing voting systems has studied by analyzing their
structure and the drawbacks that should consider in future to improve the whole
election process from keeping the privacy of the voter, casting a vote with the
possibility to check if it was counted correctly to publishing the results. The
result of the paper will give a new approach to extend the target of the
election from small scale to large scale despite the fact of Ethereum
limitation which can cast on the blockchain just five votes per minute. The
primary challenge is to find an answer for this question: ""How to balance
between voter privacy and transparency without breaking the important rule

79,Distributed Voting/Ranking with Optimal Number of States per Node,"Considering a network with $n$ nodes, where each node initially votes for one
(or more) choices out of $K$ possible choices, we present a Distributed
Multi-choice Voting/Ranking (DMVR) algorithm to determine either the choice
with maximum vote (the voting problem) or to rank all the choices in terms of
their acquired votes (the ranking problem). The algorithm consolidates node
votes across the network by updating the states of interacting nodes using two
key operations, the union and the intersection. The proposed algorithm is
simple, independent from network size, and easily scalable in terms of the
number of choices $K$, using only $K\times 2^{K-1}$ nodal states for voting,
and $K\times K!$ nodal states for ranking. We prove the number of states to be
optimal in the ranking case, this optimality is conjectured to also apply to
the voting case. The time complexity of the algorithm is analyzed in complete
graphs. We show that the time complexity for both ranking and voting is
$O(\log(n))$ for given vote percentages, and is inversely proportional to the
minimum of the vote percentage differences among various choices.",1703.08838v1,cs.DC,2017-03-26 16:19:31+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Saber Salehkaleybar'), arxiv.Result.Author('Arsalan Sharif-Nassab'), arxiv.Result.Author('S. Jamaloddin Golestani')]",

number of unique counting methods in the bibliometric research literature, 2)
to what extent the counting methods can be categorized according to selected
characteristics of the counting methods, 3) methods and elements to assess the
internal validity of the counting methods, and 4) to what extent and with which
characteristics the counting methods are used in research evaluations.
  The review identifies 32 counting methods introduced during the period 1981 -
2018. Two frameworks categorize these counting methods. Framework 1 describes
selected mathematical properties of counting methods, and Framework 2 describes
arguments for choosing a counting method. Twenty of the 32 counting methods are
rank-dependent, fractionalized, and introduced to measure contribution,
participation, etc. of an object of study. Next, three criteria for internal
validity are used to identify five methods that test the adequacy of counting
methods, two elements that test sensitivity, and three elements that test
homogeneity of the counting methods. These methods and elements may be used to
assess the internal validity of counting methods. Finally, a literature search
finds research evaluations that use the counting methods. Only three of the 32
counting methods are used by four research evaluations or more. Of these three
counting methods, two are used with the same characteristics as defined in the
studies that introduced the counting methods.
  The review provides practitioners in research evaluation and researchers in
bibliometrics with a detailed foundation for working with counting methods. At
the same time, many of the findings in the review provide bases for future

problems. These methods can be subdivided into integral methods (fast Fourier
transform methods, tensor-grid method) which solve the stray field directly and
in differential equation methods (finite-element method), which compute the
stray field as the solution of a partial differential equation. It turns out
that for cuboid structures the integral methods, which work on cuboid grids

finite-element method in terms of the ratio of computational effort to
accuracy. Among these three methods the tensor grid method is the fastest.

type methods, one derived from the Kaczmarz method and the other derived from

The advantage are simple and easy to implement, while the disadvantages are
slow convergence speed, and the symmetric Kaczmarz method is the same. For the
standard form of this method, once the iterative matrix is generated, it can be
used continuously in the subsequent iterations. Moreover, the iterative matrix
can be stored in the image reconstructive devices, which makes the Kaczmarz
method and the symmetric Kaczmarz method can be used like the simultaneous
iterative reconstructive techniques (SIRT). Meanwhile, theoretical analysis
shows that the convergence rate of symmetric Kaczmarz method is better than the
Kaczmarz method but is slightly worse than that of two iterations Kaczmarz
method, which is verified numerically. Numerical experiments also show that the

convergence of iterative methods is using preconditioner. As we show the best
possible preconditioner for this method can be constructed from QR
decomposition of the system matrix, but the complexity of this procedure is too
high. Therefore, to reduce this complexity, we use random sketching and compare

iterative solutions of equations that ensures convergence in cases where the

addition, the method has super quadratic convergence of order 2.414. Newton

increasingly large number or off-shooting away to another root further from the
desired domain or off shooting to an invalid domain where the function may not
be defined. In addition when the derivative at the iteration point is zero,
Newton method stalls. In most of these cases, hybrids of several methods such
as Newton, bisection and secant methods are suggested as substitute methods and
Newton method is essentially blended with other methods or altogether
abandoned. This paper argues that a solution is still possible in most of these

100,Limiting Risk by Turning Manifest Phantoms into Evil Zombies,"Drawing a random sample of ballots to conduct a risk-limiting audit generally
requires knowing how the ballots cast in an election are organized into groups,
for instance, how many containers of ballots there are in all and how many
ballots are in each container. A list of the ballot group identifiers along
with number of ballots in each group is called a ballot manifest. What if the
ballot manifest is not accurate? Surprisingly, even if ballots are known to be
missing from the manifest, it is not necessary to make worst-case assumptions
about those ballots--for instance, to adjust the margin by the number of
missing ballots--to ensure that the audit remains conservative. Rather, it
suffices to make worst-case assumptions about the individual randomly selected
ballots that the audit cannot find. This observation provides a simple
modification to some risk-limiting audit procedures that makes them
automatically become more conservative if the ballot manifest has errors. The
modification--phantoms to evil zombies (~2EZ)--requires only an upper bound on
the total number of ballots cast. ~2EZ makes the audit P-value stochastically
larger than it would be had the manifest been accurate, automatically requiring
more than enough ballots to be audited to offset the manifest errors. This
ensures that the true risk limit remains smaller than the nominal risk limit.
On the other hand, if the manifest is in fact accurate and the upper bound on
the total number of ballots equals the total according to the manifest, ~2EZ
has no effect at all on the number of ballots audited nor on the true risk
limit.",1207.3413v1,stat.AP,2012-07-14 11:26:02+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Jorge H. Banuelos'), arxiv.Result.Author('Philip B. Stark')]",

Menu"" consisting of several prices. In equilibrium, the adversary can buy the
real ballots of any strict subset of districts at a price corresponding to the
willingness to sell on the part of the citizens holding such ballots. By
contrast, decoy voters are trapped into selling their ballots at a low, or even
negligible, price. Blowing up the adversary's budget by introducing decoy

105,The ATHENA Class of Risk-Limiting Ballot Polling Audits,"The main risk-limiting ballot polling audit in use today, BRAVO, is designed
for use when single ballots are drawn at random and a decision regarding
whether to stop the audit or draw another ballot is taken after each ballot
draw (ballot-by-ballot (B2) audits). On the other hand, real ballot polling
audits draw many ballots in a single round before determining whether to stop
(round-by-round (R2) audits). We show that BRAVO results in significant
inefficiency when directly applied to real R2 audits. We present the ATHENA
class of R2 stopping rules, which we show are risk-limiting if the round
schedule is pre-determined (before the audit begins). We prove that each rule
is at least as efficient as the corresponding BRAVO stopping rule applied at
the end of the round. We have open-source software libraries implementing most
of our results.
  We show that ATHENA halves the number of ballots required, for all state
margins in the 2016 US Presidential election and a first round with $90\%$
stopping probability, when compared to BRAVO (stopping rule applied at the end
of the round). We present simulation results supporting the 90% stopping
probability claims and our claims for the risk accrued in the first round.
Further, ATHENA reduces the number of ballots by more than a quarter for low
margins, when compared to the BRAVO stopping rule applied on ballots in
selection order. This implies that keeping track of the order when drawing
ballots R2 is not beneficial, because ATHENA is more efficient even without
information on selection order. These results are significant because current
approaches to real ballot polling election audits use the B2 BRAVO rules,
requiring about twice as much work on the part of election officials. Applying
the rules in selection order requires fewer ballots, but keeping track of the
order, and entering it into audit software, adds to the effort.",2008.02315v5,cs.CR,2020-08-05 18:47:37+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Filip Zagórski'), arxiv.Result.Author('Grant McClearn'), arxiv.Result.Author('Sarah Morin'), arxiv.Result.Author('Neal McBurnett'), arxiv.Result.Author('Poorvi L.

Our method involves doing $k$ ""cuts"", each involving moving a random portion of
ballots from the top to the bottom of the stack, and then picking the ballot on
top. Unlike conventional methods of picking a ballot at random, $k$-cut does
not require identification numbers on the ballots or counting many ballots per
draw. We analyze how close the distribution of chosen ballots is to the uniform
distribution, and design different mitigation procedures. We show that $k=6$

it does not require a ballot manifest; (2) it can be conducted independently at
different locations, rather than requiring a central authority to select the
sample from the whole population of cast ballots or requiring stratified
sampling; (3) it can start in polling places on election night, before margins
are known. If the reported margins for the 2016 U.S. Presidential election are

108,"Symmetric Dyck tilings, ballot tableaux and tree-like tableaux of shifted shapes","Symmetric Dyck tilings and ballot tilings are certain tilings in the region
surrounded by two ballot paths. We study the relations of combinatorial objects
which are bijective to symmetric Dyck tilings such as labeled trees, Hermite
histories, and perfect matchings. We also introduce two operations on labeled
trees for symmetric Dyck tilings: symmetric Dyck tiling strip (symDTS) and
symmetric Dyck tiling ribbon (symDTR). We give two definitions of Hermite
histories for symmetric Dyck tilings, and show that they are equivalent by use
of the correspondence between symDTS operation and an Hermite history. Since
ballot tilings form a subset in the set of symmetric Dyck tilings, we construct
an inclusive map from labeled trees for ballot tilings to labeled trees for
symmetric Dyck tilings. By this inclusive map, the results for symmetric Dyck
tilings can be applied to those of ballot tilings. We introduce and study the
notions of ballot tableaux and tree-like tableaux of shifted shapes, which are

109,SOBA: Secrecy-preserving Observable Ballot-level Audit,"SOBA is an approach to election verification that provides observers with
justifiably high confidence that the reported results of an election are
consistent with an audit trail (""ballots""), which can be paper or electronic.
SOBA combines three ideas: (1) publishing cast vote records (CVRs) separately
for each contest, so that anyone can verify that each reported contest outcome
is correct, if the CVRs reflect voters' intentions with sufficient accuracy;
(2) shrouding a mapping between ballots and the CVRs for those ballots to
prevent the loss of privacy that could occur otherwise; (3) assessing the
accuracy with which the CVRs reflect voters' intentions for a collection of
contests while simultaneously assessing the integrity of the shrouded mapping
between ballots and CVRs by comparing randomly selected ballots to the CVRs
that purport to represent them. Step (1) is related to work by the Humboldt
County Election Transparency Project, but publishing CVRs separately for
individual contests rather than images of entire ballots preserves privacy.
Step (2) requires a cryptographic commitment from elections officials.
Observers participate in step (3), which relies on the ""super-simple
simultaneous single-ballot risk-limiting audit."" Step (3) is designed to reveal
relatively few ballots if the shrouded mapping is proper and the CVRs
accurately reflect voter intent. But if the reported outcomes of the contests
differ from the outcomes that a full hand count would show, step (3) is
guaranteed to have a large chance of requiring all the ballots to be counted by
hand, thereby limiting the risk that an incorrect outcome will become official

110,"Voter Verification of BMD Ballots Is a Two-Part Question: Can They? Mostly, They Can. Do They? Mostly, They Don't","The question of whether or not voters actually verify ballots produced by
ballot marking devices (BMDs) is presently the subject of some controversy.
Recent studies (e.g., Bernhard, et al. 2020) suggest the verification rate is
low. What is not clear from previous research is whether this is more a result
of voters being unable to do so accurately or whether this is because voters
simply choose not to attempt verification in the first place. In order to
understand this problem, we conducted an experiment in which 108 participants
participated in a mock election where the BMD displayed the voters' true
choices, but then changed a subset of those choices on the printed ballot. The
design of the printed ballot, the length of the ballot, the number of changes
that were made to the ballot, the location of those changes, and the
instructions provided to the voters were manipulated as part of the experiment.
Results indicated that of those voters who chose to examine the printed ballot,
76% detected anomalies, indicating that voters can reliably detect errors on
their ballot if they will simply review it. This suggests that administrative
remedies, rather than attempts to alter fundamental human perceptual
capabilities, could be employed to encourage voters to check their ballots,

traditional plurality voting in which voters submit rankings over the
candidates rather than single votes. In practice, elections using IRV often
restrict the ballot length, the number of candidates a voter is allowed to rank
on their ballot. We theoretically and empirically analyze how ballot length can
influence the outcome of an election, given fixed voter preferences. We show
that there exist preference profiles over $k$ candidates such that up to $k-1$
different candidates win at different ballot lengths. We derive exact lower
bounds on the number of voters required for such profiles and provide a
construction matching the lower bound for unrestricted voter preferences.
Additionally, we characterize which sequences of winners are possible over
ballot lengths and provide explicit profile constructions achieving any
feasible winner sequence. We also examine how classic preference restrictions
influence our results--for instance, single-peakedness makes $k-1$ different
winners impossible but still allows at least $\Omega(\sqrt k)$. Finally, we
analyze a collection of 168 real-world elections, where we truncate rankings to
simulate shorter ballots. We find that shorter ballots could have changed the
outcome in one quarter of these elections. Our results highlight ballot length

state-of-the-art decentralized SLAM components into a new, complete

co-optimization, existing decentralized visual SLAM systems regularly exchange
the full map data between all robots, incurring large data transfers at a
complexity that scales quadratically with the robot count. In contrast, our
method performs efficient data association in two stages: in the first stage a
compact full-image descriptor is deterministically sent to only one robot. In
the second stage, which is only executed if the first stage succeeded, the data
required for relative pose estimation is sent, again to only one robot. Thus,
data association scales linearly with the robot count and uses highly compact
place representations. For optimization, a state-of-the-art decentralized

122,Graph Analysis in Decentralized Online Social Networks with Fine-Grained Privacy Protection,"Graph analysts cannot directly obtain the global structure in decentralized
social networks, and analyzing such a network requires collecting local views
of the social graph from individual users. Since the edges between users may
reveal sensitive social interactions in the local view, applying differential
privacy in the data collection process is often desirable, which provides
strong and rigorous privacy guarantees. In practical decentralized social
graphs, different edges have different privacy requirements due to the distinct
sensitivity levels. However, the existing differentially private analysis of
social graphs provide the same protection for all edges. To address this issue,
this work proposes a fine-grained privacy notion as well as novel algorithms
for private graph analysis. We first design a fine-grained relationship
differential privacy (FGR-DP) notion for social graph analysis, which enforces
different protections for the edges with distinct privacy requirements. Then,
we design algorithms for triangle counting and k-stars counting, respectively,
which can accurately estimate subgraph counts given fine-grained protection for
social edges. We also analyze upper bounds on the estimation error, including
k-stars and triangle counts, and show their superior performance compared with
the state-of-the-arts. Finally, we perform extensive experiments on two real
social graph datasets and demonstrate that the proposed mechanisms satisfying
FGR-DP have better utility than the state-of-the-art mechanisms due to the
finer-grained protection.",2212.05253v1,cs.CR,2022-12-10 10:02:04+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Lele Zheng'), arxiv.Result.Author('Bowen Deng'), arxiv.Result.Author('Tao Zhang'), arxiv.Result.Author('Yulong Shen'), arxiv.Result.Author('Yang Cao')]",

(in fact, a continuum of equilibria) of the formation control system, and hence
there are solutions of the system which converge to some equilibria other than

this, it is possible to reduce bandwidth by up to a factor of n, the robot
count, by casting visual place recognition to a key-value lookup problem. In
[1], we exploited this for the bag-of-words method [3], [4]. Our method of
casting bag-of-words, however, results in a complex decentralized system, which
has inherently worse recall than its centralized counterpart. In this paper, we
instead start from the recent full-image description method NetVLAD [5]. As we
show, casting this to a key-value lookup problem can be achieved with k-means
clustering, and results in a much simpler system than [1]. The resulting system

126,Evaluating Generalization and Transfer Capacity of Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning Across Variable Number of Agents,"Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) problems often require cooperation
among agents in order to solve a task. Centralization and decentralization are
two approaches used for cooperation in MARL. While fully decentralized methods
are prone to converge to suboptimal solutions due to partial observability and
nonstationarity, the methods involving centralization suffer from scalability
limitations and lazy agent problem. Centralized training decentralized
execution paradigm brings out the best of these two approaches; however,
centralized training still has an upper limit of scalability not only for
acquired coordination performance but also for model size and training time. In
this work, we adopt the centralized training with decentralized execution
paradigm and investigate the generalization and transfer capacity of the
trained models across variable number of agents. This capacity is assessed by
training variable number of agents in a specific MARL problem and then
performing greedy evaluations with variable number of agents for each training
configuration. Thus, we analyze the evaluation performance for each combination
of agent count for training versus evaluation. We perform experimental
evaluations on predator prey and traffic junction environments and demonstrate
that it is possible to obtain similar or higher evaluation performance by
training with less agents. We conclude that optimal number of agents to perform
training may differ from the target number of agents and argue that transfer
across large number of agents can be a more efficient solution to scaling up

fundamental topics in many areas. In this paper, we consider discrete-event
systems (DESs) modeled by finite-state automata (FSAs). There exist results for
decentralized versions of the latter problem but there is almost no result for
a decentralized version of the former problem. We propose a decentralized
version of strong detectability called co-detectability which implies that once
a system satisfies this property, for each generated infinite-length event
sequence, at least one local observer can determine the current and subsequent
states after a common observation time delay. We prove that the problem of
verifying co-detectability of FSAs is coNP-hard. Moreover, we use a unified
concurrent-composition method to give PSPACE verification algorithms for
co-detectability, co-diagnosability, and co-predictability of FSAs, without any
assumption or modifying the FSAs under consideration, where co-diagnosability
is firstly studied by [Debouk & Lafortune & Teneketzis 2000], while
co-predictability is firstly studied by [Kumar \& Takai 2010]. By our proposed
unified method, one can see that in order to verify co-detectability, more
technical difficulties will be met compared to verifying the other two
properties, because in co-detectability, generated outputs are counted, but in
the latter two properties, only occurrences of events are counted. For example,
when one output was generated, any number of unobservable events could have
occurred. The PSPACE-hardness of verifying co-diagnosability is already known
in the literature. In this paper, we prove the PSPACE-hardness of verifying
co-predictability.",2001.04729v5,math.OC,2020-01-14 12:01:59+00:00,[arxiv.Result.Author('Kuize Zhang')],

counts. To solve the problem, an iterative algorithm is proposed. After that, a

132,BotNet: A Simulator for Studying the Effects of Accurate Communication Models on Multi-agent and Swarm Control,"Decentralized control in multi-robot systems is dependent on accurate and
reliable communication between agents. Important communication factors, such as
latency and packet delivery ratio, are strong functions of the number of agents
in the network. Findings from studies of mobile and high node-count
radio-frequency (RF) mesh networks have only been transferred to the domain of
multi-robot systems to a limited extent, and typical multi-agent robotic
simulators often depend on simple propagation models that do not reflect the
behavior of realistic RF networks. In this paper, we present a new open source
swarm robotics simulator, BotNet, with an embedded standards-compliant
time-synchronized channel hopping (6TiSCH) RF mesh network simulator. Using
this simulator we show how more accurate communications models can limit even
simple multi-robot control tasks such as flocking and formation control, with
agent counts ranging from 10 up to 2500 agents. The experimental results are
used to motivate changes to the inter-robot communication propagation models

large amounts of their personal data as part of their search queries, among

trusted execution environments (TEEs) as provided by Intel SGX. Further,
CYCLOSA proposes a novel adaptive privacy protection solution that reduces the
risk of user re- identification. CYCLOSA sends fake queries to the search
engine and dynamically adapts their count according to the sensitivity of the
user query. In addition, CYCLOSA meets scalability as it is fully

  In this work we present HiveMind, a centralized coordination control platform

edge devices to reduce network traffic. HiveMind employs an event-driven
serverless framework to run tasks on the cluster, guarantees fault tolerance
both in the edge devices and serverless functions, and handles straggler tasks

drones on two scenarios; searching for given items, and counting unique people

that: 1) MakerDao and Compound are more decentralized in the transactions than
Aave and Liquity. 2) Although decentralized banking transactions are supposed
to be decentralized, the data show that four banks have primary external
transaction core addresses such as Huobi, Coinbase, Binance, etc. We also

142,Towards Fully Declarative Program Analysis via Source Code Transformation,"Advances in logic programming and increasing industrial uptake of
Datalog-inspired approaches demonstrate the emerging need to express powerful
code analyses more easily. Declarative program analysis frameworks (e.g., using
logic programming like Datalog) significantly ease defining analyses compared
to imperative implementations. However, the declarative benefits of these
frameworks only materialize after parsing and translating source code to
generate facts. Fact generation remains a non-declarative precursor to analysis
where imperative implementations first parse and interpret program structures
(e.g., abstract syntax trees and control-flow graphs). The procedure of fact
generation thus remains opaque and difficult for non-experts to understand or
modify. We present a new perspective on this analysis workflow by proposing
declarative fact generation to ease specification and exploration of
lightweight declarative analyses. Our approach demonstrates the first venture
towards fully declarative analysis specification across multiple languages. The
key idea is to translate source code directly to Datalog facts in the analysis
domain using declarative syntax transformation. We then reuse existing Datalog
analyses over generated facts, yielding an end-to-end declarative pipeline. As
a first approximation we pursue a syntax-driven approach and demonstrate the
feasibility of generating and using lightweight versions of liveness and call
graph reachability properties. We then discuss the workability of extending
declarative fact generation to also incorporate semantic information.",2112.12398v1,cs.SE,2021-12-23 07:49:05+00:00,[arxiv.Result.Author('Rijnard van Tonder')],

processes that arise in, but are not limited to, the social sciences. These
areas include business process analysis, healthcare workflow analysis and
policy process analysis. This method is quite general and applicable to any
situation in which declarative-type constraints of a modal and/or temporal
nature play a part.
  A declarative process is a process in which activities may freely happen
while respecting a set of constraints. For such a process, anything may happen
so long as it is not explicitly forbidden. Declarative processes have been used
and studied as models of business and healthcare workflows by several authors.
In considering a declarative process as a model of some system it is natural to
consider how the process behaves with respect to stakeholders. We derive a
measure for stakeholder utility that can be applied in a very general setting.
This derivation is achieved by listing a collection a properties which we argue
such a stakeholder utility function ought to satisfy, and then using these to
show a very specific form must hold for such a utility. The utility measure
depends on the set of unique traces of the declarative process, and calculating
this set requires a combinatorial analysis of the declarative graph that
represents the process.
  This builds on previous work of the author wherein the combinatorial
diversity metrics for declarative processes were derived for use in policy
process analysis. The collection of stakeholder utilities can themselves then
be used to form a metric with which we can compare different declarative
processes to one another. These are illustrated using several examples of
declarative processes that already exist in the literature.",2202.03520v1,cs.AI,2022-02-07 21:11:13+00:00,[arxiv.Result.Author('Mark Dukes')],

expressions one can formalize high-level mathematical computations on models
that would be difficult or impossible to perform directly on a lower-level
simulation program, in a general-purpose programming language. Examples of such
computations on models include model analysis, relatively general-purpose
model-reduction maps, and the initial phases of model implementation, all of
which should preserve or approximate the mathematical semantics of a complex
biological model. The potential advantages are particularly relevant in the
case of developmental modeling, wherein complex spatial structures exhibit
dynamics at molecular, cellular, and organogenic levels to relate genotype to
multicellular phenotype. Multiscale modeling can benefit from both the
expressive power of declarative modeling languages and the application of model
reduction methods to link models across scale. Based on previous work, here we
define declarative modeling of complex biological systems by defining the
operator algebra semantics of an increasingly powerful series of declarative
modeling languages including reaction-like dynamics of parameterized and
extended objects; we define semantics-preserving implementation and

analytics systems through its support for specifying and integrating machine
learning and interactive visualization methods. As data analysis methods based
on machine learning and artificial intelligence continue to advance, a visual
analytics solution can leverage these methods for better exploiting large and
complex data. However, integrating machine learning methods with interactive
visual analysis is challenging. Existing declarative programming libraries and
toolkits for visualization lack support for coupling machine learning methods.
By providing a declarative language for visual analytics, P6 can empower more
developers to create visual analytics applications that combine machine
learning and visualization methods for data analysis and problem solving.

160,A Restrained Paillier Cryptosystem and Its Applications for Access Control of Common Secret,"The modified Paillier cryptosystem has become extremely popular and applied
in many fields, owning to its additive homomorphism. This cryptosystem provides
weak private keys and a strong private key. A weak private key only can decrypt
ciphertexts under the corresponding public key. The strong private key can
decrypt all ciphertexts even under different public keys. When the modified
Paillier cryptosystem is applied in a system, the member, often the system
administrator, has the strong private key and can decrypt all ciphertexts. If
this system administrator is attacked or compromised, the security of the
application system absolutely break down. Thus, it is important to stop the
decryption of the strong private key. To address this issue, we propose an
restrained version of the modified Paillier cryptosystem (Restrained-Paillier),
by endowing the multiplicative homomorphism. We perform the additive encryption
on the multiplicative ciphertext and generate the mixed ciphertext, which can
not be decrypted by the strong private key. Based on this Restrained-Paillier,
we develop two applications. Firstly, we realize access control of common
secret of two owners. In our scheme, only one owner cannot access secret.
Secondly, we present three protocols for identity distribution and key
management, identity authentication and private key recovery. Security analysis
shows that the Restrained-Paillier cryptosystem can resist the chosen plaintext
attack. The experimental results illustrate the utility and efficiency of the
proposed protocols.",1912.09034v1,cs.CR,2019-12-19 06:50:53+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Xiaojuan Dong'), arxiv.Result.Author('Weiming Zhang'), arxiv.Result.Author('Mohsin Shah'), arxiv.Result.Author('Bei Wang'), arxiv.Result.Author('Nenghai Yu')]",

decryption server without revealing information about the plaintext message.
Such schemes are useful, for example, for the implementation of privacy
preserving encrypted file storages and payment systems. In terms of
functionality, blind decryption is close to oblivious transfer. For noiseless
channels, information-theoretically secure oblivious transfer is impossible.
However, in this paper we show that this is not the case for blind decryption.
We formulate a definition of perfect secrecy of symmetric blind decryption for
the following setting: at most one of the scheme participants is a malicious
observer. We also devise a symmetric blind decryption scheme based on modular
arithmetic on a ring $\mathbb{Z}_{p^2}$, where $p$ is a prime, and show that it

on the decision boundaries of the trained model, and although such methods
successfully hide the contents of images from the entity in charge of federated
learning, they provide crucial information to that entity about the decision
boundaries of the trained model. Once the entity has exact samples on the
decision boundaries of the model, they may use it for effective adversarial
attacks on the model during training and/or afterwards. If we have to hide our
images from that entity, how can we trust them with the decision boundaries of
our model? As a remedy, we propose a method to encrypt the images, and have a
decryption module hidden inside the model. The entity in charge of federated
learning will only have access to a set of complex-valued coefficients, but the
model will first decrypt the images and then put them through the convolutional

combining SISO convolutional decoding and decrypting of cryptographic check
values to improve the correction of errors in themselves. If Soft Input
Decryption is successful, i.e. all wrong bit of a cryptographic check value are
corrected, these bit are sent as feedback information to the channel decoder
for a next iteration. The bit of the next iteration are corrected by channel
decoding followed by another Soft Input Decryption. Iterative Soft Input
Decryption uses interleaved blocks. If one block can be corrected by Soft Input
Decryption, the decoding of the interleaved block is improved (serial scheme).
If Soft Input Decryption is applied on both blocks and one of the blocks can be
corrected, the corrected block is used for an improved decoding of the other

178,"Passive, Transparent, and Selective TLS Decryption for Network Security Monitoring","Internet traffic is increasingly encrypted. While this protects the
confidentiality and integrity of communication, it prevents network monitoring
systems (NMS) and intrusion detection systems (IDSs) from effectively analyzing
the now encrypted payloads. Therefore, many enterprise networks have deployed
man-in-the-middle (MitM) proxies that intercept TLS connections at the network
border to examine packet payloads and thus retain some visibility. However,
recent studies have shown that TLS interception often reduces connection
security and potentially introduces additional attack vectors to the network.
In this paper, we present a cooperative approach in which end-hosts as
cryptographic endpoints selectively provide TLS key material to NMS for
decryption. This enables endpoints to control who can decrypt which content and
lets users retain privacy for chosen connections. We implement a prototype
based on the Zeek NMS that is able to receive key material from hosts, decrypt
TLS connections and perform analyzes on the cleartext. The patch is freely
available and we plan to upstream our changes to Zeek once they are mature
enough. In our evaluation, we discuss how our approach conceptually requires
significantly less computational resources compared to the commonly deployed
MitM proxies. Our experimental results indicate, that TLS decryption increases
a runtime overhead of about 2.5 times of the original runtime on cleartext.
Additionally, we show that the latency for transmitting keys between hosts and

perform an analytical study of $SO(10)$-inspired models and leptogenesis with
hierarchical right-handed (RH) neutrino spectrum. Under the approximation of
negligible misalignment between the neutrino Yukawa basis and the charged
lepton basis, we find an analytical expression for the final asymmetry directly
in terms of the low energy neutrino parameters that fully reproduces previous
numerical results. This expression also shows that is possible to identify an
effective leptogenesis phase for these models. When we also impose the wash-out
of a large pre-existing asymmetry $N^{\rm p,i}_{B-L}$, the strong thermal (ST)
condition, we derive analytically all those constraints on the low energy
neutrino parameters that characterise the {\rm ST}-$SO(10)$-inspired
leptogenesis solution, confirming previous numerical results. In particular we
show why, though neutrino masses have to be necessarily normally ordered, the
solution implies an analytical lower bound on the effective neutrino-less
double beta decay neutrino mass, $m_{ee} \gtrsim 8\,{\rm meV}$, for $N^{\rm
p,i}_{B-L}=10^{-3}$, testable with next generation experiments. This, in
combination with an upper bound on the atmospheric mixing angle, necessarily in
the first octant, forces the lightest neutrino mass within a narrow range $m_1
\simeq (10$-$30)\,{\rm meV}$ (corresponding to $\sum_i \, m_i \simeq
(75$-$125)\,{\rm meV}$). We also show why the solution could correctly predict
a non-vanishing reactor neutrino mixing angle and requires the Dirac phase to
be in the fourth quadrant, implying $\sin\delta $ (and $J_{CP}$) negative as
hinted by current global analyses. Many of the analytical results presented

requires knowing how the ballots cast in an election are organized into groups,
for instance, how many containers of ballots there are in all and how many
ballots are in each container. A list of the ballot group identifiers along
with number of ballots in each group is called a ballot manifest. What if the
ballot manifest is not accurate? Surprisingly, even if ballots are known to be
missing from the manifest, it is not necessary to make worst-case assumptions
about those ballots--for instance, to adjust the margin by the number of
missing ballots--to ensure that the audit remains conservative. Rather, it
suffices to make worst-case assumptions about the individual randomly selected
ballots that the audit cannot find. This observation provides a simple
modification to some risk-limiting audit procedures that makes them
automatically become more conservative if the ballot manifest has errors. The
modification--phantoms to evil zombies (~2EZ)--requires only an upper bound on
the total number of ballots cast. ~2EZ makes the audit P-value stochastically
larger than it would be had the manifest been accurate, automatically requiring
more than enough ballots to be audited to offset the manifest errors. This
ensures that the true risk limit remains smaller than the nominal risk limit.
On the other hand, if the manifest is in fact accurate and the upper bound on
the total number of ballots equals the total according to the manifest, ~2EZ

a cyberwar fought by committed civilians and volunteer 'hacktivists' linked to
cybercrime groups is misleading. We collected 281k web defacement attacks, 1.7M
reflected DDoS attacks, and 441 announcements (with 58k replies) of a volunteer
hacking discussion group for two months before and four months after the

significantly caught the attention of the low-level cybercrime community, with
notable shifts in the geographical distribution of both defacement and DDoS
attacks. However, the role of these players in so-called cyberwarfare is minor,
and they do not resemble the 'hacktivists' imagined in popular criminological
accounts. Initial waves of interest led to more defacers participating in
attack campaigns, but rather than targeting critical infrastructure, there were
mass attacks against random websites within '.ru' and '.ua'. We can find no
evidence of high-profile actions of the kind hypothesised by the prevalent
narrative. The much-vaunted role of the 'IT Army of Ukraine' co-ordination
group is mixed; the targets they promoted were seldom defaced although they
were often subjected to DDoS attacks. Our main finding is that there was a
clear loss of interest in carrying out defacements and DDoS attacks after just
a few weeks. Contrary to some expert predictions, the involvement of civilian
and volunteer `hacktivists' in the conflict appears to have been minor and
short-lived; it is unlikely to escalate further.",2208.10629v3,cs.CR,2022-08-22 22:11:04+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Anh V. Vu'), arxiv.Result.Author('Daniel R.

justifiably high confidence that the reported results of an election are
consistent with an audit trail (""ballots""), which can be paper or electronic.
SOBA combines three ideas: (1) publishing cast vote records (CVRs) separately
for each contest, so that anyone can verify that each reported contest outcome
is correct, if the CVRs reflect voters' intentions with sufficient accuracy;
(2) shrouding a mapping between ballots and the CVRs for those ballots to
prevent the loss of privacy that could occur otherwise; (3) assessing the
accuracy with which the CVRs reflect voters' intentions for a collection of
contests while simultaneously assessing the integrity of the shrouded mapping
between ballots and CVRs by comparing randomly selected ballots to the CVRs
that purport to represent them. Step (1) is related to work by the Humboldt
County Election Transparency Project, but publishing CVRs separately for
individual contests rather than images of entire ballots preserves privacy.
Step (2) requires a cryptographic commitment from elections officials.
Observers participate in step (3), which relies on the ""super-simple
simultaneous single-ballot risk-limiting audit."" Step (3) is designed to reveal
relatively few ballots if the shrouded mapping is proper and the CVRs
accurately reflect voter intent. But if the reported outcomes of the contests

Recent studies (e.g., Bernhard, et al. 2020) suggest the verification rate is

of voters being unable to do so accurately or whether this is because voters
simply choose not to attempt verification in the first place. In order to
understand this problem, we conducted an experiment in which 108 participants
participated in a mock election where the BMD displayed the voters' true
choices, but then changed a subset of those choices on the printed ballot. The
design of the printed ballot, the length of the ballot, the number of changes
that were made to the ballot, the location of those changes, and the
instructions provided to the voters were manipulated as part of the experiment.
Results indicated that of those voters who chose to examine the printed ballot,
76% detected anomalies, indicating that voters can reliably detect errors on
their ballot if they will simply review it. This suggests that administrative

on their ballot. We theoretically and empirically analyze how ballot length can
influence the outcome of an election, given fixed voter preferences. We show
that there exist preference profiles over $k$ candidates such that up to $k-1$
different candidates win at different ballot lengths. We derive exact lower
bounds on the number of voters required for such profiles and provide a
construction matching the lower bound for unrestricted voter preferences.
Additionally, we characterize which sequences of winners are possible over
ballot lengths and provide explicit profile constructions achieving any
feasible winner sequence. We also examine how classic preference restrictions
influence our results--for instance, single-peakedness makes $k-1$ different
winners impossible but still allows at least $\Omega(\sqrt k)$. Finally, we
analyze a collection of 168 real-world elections, where we truncate rankings to
simulate shorter ballots. We find that shorter ballots could have changed the
outcome in one quarter of these elections. Our results highlight ballot length

200,Limiting Risk by Turning Manifest Phantoms into Evil Zombies,"Drawing a random sample of ballots to conduct a risk-limiting audit generally
requires knowing how the ballots cast in an election are organized into groups,
for instance, how many containers of ballots there are in all and how many
ballots are in each container. A list of the ballot group identifiers along
with number of ballots in each group is called a ballot manifest. What if the
ballot manifest is not accurate? Surprisingly, even if ballots are known to be
missing from the manifest, it is not necessary to make worst-case assumptions
about those ballots--for instance, to adjust the margin by the number of
missing ballots--to ensure that the audit remains conservative. Rather, it
suffices to make worst-case assumptions about the individual randomly selected
ballots that the audit cannot find. This observation provides a simple
modification to some risk-limiting audit procedures that makes them
automatically become more conservative if the ballot manifest has errors. The
modification--phantoms to evil zombies (~2EZ)--requires only an upper bound on
the total number of ballots cast. ~2EZ makes the audit P-value stochastically
larger than it would be had the manifest been accurate, automatically requiring
more than enough ballots to be audited to offset the manifest errors. This
ensures that the true risk limit remains smaller than the nominal risk limit.
On the other hand, if the manifest is in fact accurate and the upper bound on
the total number of ballots equals the total according to the manifest, ~2EZ
has no effect at all on the number of ballots audited nor on the true risk
limit.",1207.3413v1,stat.AP,2012-07-14 11:26:02+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Jorge H. Banuelos'), arxiv.Result.Author('Philip B. Stark')]",

206,$k$-Cut: A Simple Approximately-Uniform Method for Sampling Ballots in Post-Election Audits,"We present an approximate sampling framework and discuss how risk-limiting
audits can compensate for these approximations, while maintaining their
""risk-limiting"" properties. Our framework is general and can compensate for
counting mistakes made during audits.
  Moreover, we present and analyze a simple approximate sampling
method,""$k$-cut"", for picking a ballot randomly from a stack, without counting.
Our method involves doing $k$ ""cuts"", each involving moving a random portion of
ballots from the top to the bottom of the stack, and then picking the ballot on
top. Unlike conventional methods of picking a ballot at random, $k$-cut does
not require identification numbers on the ballots or counting many ballots per
draw. We analyze how close the distribution of chosen ballots is to the uniform
distribution, and design different mitigation procedures. We show that $k=6$
cuts is enough for an risk-limiting election audit, based on empirical data,

it does not require a ballot manifest; (2) it can be conducted independently at

justifiably high confidence that the reported results of an election are
consistent with an audit trail (""ballots""), which can be paper or electronic.
SOBA combines three ideas: (1) publishing cast vote records (CVRs) separately
for each contest, so that anyone can verify that each reported contest outcome
is correct, if the CVRs reflect voters' intentions with sufficient accuracy;
(2) shrouding a mapping between ballots and the CVRs for those ballots to
prevent the loss of privacy that could occur otherwise; (3) assessing the
accuracy with which the CVRs reflect voters' intentions for a collection of
contests while simultaneously assessing the integrity of the shrouded mapping
between ballots and CVRs by comparing randomly selected ballots to the CVRs
that purport to represent them. Step (1) is related to work by the Humboldt
County Election Transparency Project, but publishing CVRs separately for
individual contests rather than images of entire ballots preserves privacy.
Step (2) requires a cryptographic commitment from elections officials.
Observers participate in step (3), which relies on the ""super-simple
simultaneous single-ballot risk-limiting audit."" Step (3) is designed to reveal
relatively few ballots if the shrouded mapping is proper and the CVRs
accurately reflect voter intent. But if the reported outcomes of the contests
differ from the outcomes that a full hand count would show, step (3) is

Recent studies (e.g., Bernhard, et al. 2020) suggest the verification rate is
low. What is not clear from previous research is whether this is more a result
of voters being unable to do so accurately or whether this is because voters
simply choose not to attempt verification in the first place. In order to
understand this problem, we conducted an experiment in which 108 participants
participated in a mock election where the BMD displayed the voters' true
choices, but then changed a subset of those choices on the printed ballot. The
design of the printed ballot, the length of the ballot, the number of changes
that were made to the ballot, the location of those changes, and the
instructions provided to the voters were manipulated as part of the experiment.
Results indicated that of those voters who chose to examine the printed ballot,
76% detected anomalies, indicating that voters can reliably detect errors on
their ballot if they will simply review it. This suggests that administrative

traditional plurality voting in which voters submit rankings over the
candidates rather than single votes. In practice, elections using IRV often
restrict the ballot length, the number of candidates a voter is allowed to rank
on their ballot. We theoretically and empirically analyze how ballot length can
influence the outcome of an election, given fixed voter preferences. We show
that there exist preference profiles over $k$ candidates such that up to $k-1$
different candidates win at different ballot lengths. We derive exact lower
bounds on the number of voters required for such profiles and provide a
construction matching the lower bound for unrestricted voter preferences.
Additionally, we characterize which sequences of winners are possible over
ballot lengths and provide explicit profile constructions achieving any
feasible winner sequence. We also examine how classic preference restrictions
influence our results--for instance, single-peakedness makes $k-1$ different
winners impossible but still allows at least $\Omega(\sqrt k)$. Finally, we
analyze a collection of 168 real-world elections, where we truncate rankings to
simulate shorter ballots. We find that shorter ballots could have changed the
outcome in one quarter of these elections. Our results highlight ballot length

unused delegations, it has been suggested that each voter should declare a
personal ranking over voters she trusts. In this paper, we show that even if
personal rankings over voters are declared, the standard delegation method of
liquid democracy remains problematic. More specifically, we show that when
personal rankings over voters are declared, it could be undesirable to receive
delegated voting rights, which is contrary to what liquid democracy

of possible delegation paths and enables higher participation rates because
fewer votes are lost due to delegation cycles or abstaining agents. In order to
implement this generalization of liquid democracy, we need to find a principled
way of choosing between multiple delegation paths. In this paper, we provide a
thorough axiomatic analysis of the space of delegation rules, i.e., functions
assigning a feasible delegation path to each delegating agent. In particular,
we prove axiomatic characterizations as well as an impossibility result for
delegation rules. We also analyze requirements on delegation rules that have
been suggested by practitioners, and introduce novel rules with attractive
properties. By performing an extensive experimental analysis on synthetic as

complete a particular task, so they delegate the task to an untrusted agent
whose interests may differ from their own. Given any family of such problems
and space of mechanisms for the principal to choose from, the delegation gap is
the worst-case ratio of the principal's optimal utility when they delegate
versus their optimal utility when solving the problem on their own. In this
work, we consider the delegation gap of the generalized Pandora's box problem,
a search problem in which searching for solutions incurs known costs and
solutions are restricted by some downward-closed constraint. First, we show
that there is a special case when all random variables have binary support for
which there exist constant-factor delegation gaps for matroid constraints.
However, there is no constant-factor delegation gap for even simple non-binary
instances of the problem. Getting around this impossibility, we consider two
variants: the free-agent model, in which the agent doesn't pay the cost of
probing elements, and discounted-cost approximations, in which we discount all
costs and aim for a bicriteria approximation of the discount factor and
delegation gap. We show that there are constant-factor delegation gaps in the
free-agent model with discounted-cost approximations for certain downward
closed constraints and constant discount factors. However, constant delegation
gaps can not be achieved under either variant alone. Finally, we consider
another variant called the shared-cost model, in which the principal can choose
how costs will be shared between them and the agent before delegating the
search problem. We show that the shared-cost model exhibits a constant-factor

number of voters whose votes a voter gives enable the system designer restrict
the power of any individual voter. The Resolve Delegation problem is already

agents since voting is costly. Misbehaving agents always vote. We compare
conventional voting allowing for abstention with vote delegation. Preferences
of voters are private information and a positive outcome is achieved if
well-behaving agents win. We illustrate that vote delegation leads to quite
different outcomes than conventional voting with abstention. In particular, we
obtain three insights: First, if the number of misbehaving voters, denoted by f
, is high, both voting methods fail to deliver a positive outcome. Second, if f
takes an intermediate value, conventional voting delivers a positive outcome,
while vote delegation fails with probability one. Third, if f is low,
delegation delivers a positive outcome with higher probability than
conventional voting. Finally, our results characterize worst-case outcomes that
can happen in a liquid democracy.",2102.08823v2,cs.GT,2021-02-17 15:32:32+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Hans Gersbach'), arxiv.Result.Author('Akaki Mamageishvili'), arxiv.Result.Author('Manvir Schneider')]",

many situations the task may be delegated onwards, and this process can repeat
until it is eventually, successfully or unsuccessfully, performed. We consider

interactions are possible. These policies, based on quitting games and
multi-armed bandits, were empirically tested for effectiveness. Our results
indicate that the quitting game based policies outperform those which do not

234,Characterizing Properties and Trade-offs of Centralized Delegation Mechanisms in Liquid Democracy,"Liquid democracy is a form of transitive delegative democracy that has
received a flurry of scholarly attention from the computer science community in
recent years. In its simplest form, every agent starts with one vote and may
have other votes assigned to them via delegation from other agents. They can
choose to delegate all votes assigned to them to another agent or vote directly
with all votes assigned to them. However, many proposed realizations of liquid
democracy allow for agents to express their delegation/voting preferences in
more complex ways (e.g., a ranked list of potential delegates) and employ a
centralized delegation mechanism to compute the final vote tally. In doing so,
centralized delegation mechanisms can make decisions that affect the outcome of
a vote and where/whether agents are able to delegate their votes. Much of the
analysis thus far has focused on the ability of these mechanisms to make a
correct choice. We extend this analysis by introducing and formalizing other
important properties of a centralized delegation mechanism in liquid democracy
with respect to crucial features such as accountability, transparency,
explainability, fairness, and user agency. In addition, we evaluate existing
methods in terms of these properties, show how some prior work can be augmented
to achieve desirable properties, prove impossibility results for achieving
certain sets of properties simultaneously, and highlight directions for future
work.",2206.05339v1,cs.MA,2022-06-10 20:11:35+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Brian Brubach'), arxiv.Result.Author('Audrey Ballarin'), arxiv.Result.Author('Heeba Nazeer')]",

considered as a part of the administration mechanism. Thus, a complete access
control must provide a flexible administration model to manage delegation.
Unfortunately, to our best knowledge, there is no complete model for describing
all delegation requirements for role-based access control. Therefore, proposed
models are often extended to consider new delegation characteristics, which is
a complex task to manage and necessitate the redefinition of these models. In
this paper we describe a new delegation approach for extended role-based access
control models. We show that our approach is flexible and is sufficient to
manage all delegation requirements.",1012.2720v1,cs.CR,2010-12-13 13:10:12+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Meriam Ben Ghorbel-Talbi'), arxiv.Result.Author('Frederic Cuppens'), arxiv.Result.Author('Nora Cuppens-Boulahia'), arxiv.Result.Author('Adel Bouhoula')]","Proceedings of the 15th International Conference on Advanced

Preferences are single peaked. Proposer is uncertain about Vetoer's ideal
point. We study Proposer's optimal mechanism without transfers. Vetoer is given
a menu, or a delegation set, to choose from. The optimal delegation set
balances the extent of Proposer's compromise with the risk of a veto. Under
reasonable conditions, ""full delegation"" is optimal: Vetoer can choose any
action between the status quo and Proposer's ideal action. This outcome largely
nullifies Proposer's bargaining power; Vetoer frequently obtains her ideal
point, and there is Pareto efficiency despite asymmetric information. More
generally, we identify when ""interval delegation"" is optimal. Optimal interval
delegation can be a Pareto improvement over cheap talk. We derive comparative
statics. Vetoer receives less discretion when preferences are more likely to be
aligned, by contrast to expertise-based delegation. Methodologically, our
analysis handles stochastic mechanisms.",2006.06773v3,econ.TH,2020-06-11 19:50:47+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Navin Kartik'), arxiv.Result.Author('Andreas Kleiner'), arxiv.Result.Author('Richard Van Weelden')]","American Economic Review, December 2021"

voting and abstains under conventional voting or can delegate its votes to the
other group (voters) who decide between two alternatives. We show that free
delegation favors minorities, that is, alternatives that have a lower chance of
winning ex-ante. The same occurs if the number of voting rights that actual
voters can have is capped. When the number of delegators increases, the
probability that the ex-ante minority wins under free and capped delegation
converges to the one under conventional voting--albeit non-monotonically. Our
results are obtained in a private value setting but can be readily translated
into an information aggregation setting when voters receive a signal about the
''correct"" alternative with some probability.",2102.08835v3,cs.GT,2021-02-17 15:44:38+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Hans Gersbach'), arxiv.Result.Author('Akaki Mamageishvili'), arxiv.Result.Author('Manvir Schneider')]",

use the votes of multiple other agents to determine their own -- for instance,
an agent's vote may correspond to the majority outcome of the votes of a
trusted group of agents; second, agents can submit a ranking over multiple
delegations, so that a backup delegation can be used when their preferred
delegations are involved in cycles. The main focus of this paper is the study
of unravelling procedures that transform the delegation ballots received from
the agents into a profile of direct votes, from which a winning alternative can
then be determined by using a standard voting rule. We propose and study six
such unravelling procedures, two based on optimisation and four using a greedy
approach. We study both algorithmic and axiomatic properties, as well as
related computational complexity problems of our unravelling procedures for
different restrictions on the types of ballots that the agents can submit.",2111.13145v1,cs.AI,2021-11-25 15:58:39+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Rachael Colley'), arxiv.Result.Author('Umberto Grandi'), arxiv.Result.Author('Arianna Novaro')]",

been developed to assess election accuracy by manually inspecting randomly
selected physical ballots. Two 'principled' methods are risk-limiting audits
(RLAs) and Bayesian audits (BAs). RLAs use frequentist statistical inference
while BAs are based on Bayesian inference. Until recently, the two have been
thought of as fundamentally different.
  We present results that unify and shed light upon 'ballot-polling' RLAs and
BAs (which only require the ability to sample uniformly at random from all cast
ballot cards) for two-candidate plurality contests, which are building blocks
for auditing more complex social choice functions, including some preferential
voting systems. We highlight the connections between the methods and explore
their performance.
  First, building on a previous demonstration of the mathematical equivalence
of classical and Bayesian approaches, we show that BAs, suitably calibrated,
are risk-limiting. Second, we compare the efficiency of the methods across a
wide range of contest sizes and margins, focusing on the distribution of sample

(""single-vote"") ballot sequences in the case of SYT, and ""multi-vote"" ballot
sequences--where the voter may choose any number of candidates--in the case of
SSYT) to aid in the inductive argument. Next, we establish an identity which
allows us to prove a formula that counts multi-vote ballot sequences. We
demonstrate that, in the non-degenerate case (when this formula counts SSYTs)
it coincides with the HCF. To do the latter, we borrow parts of a technique
outlined by Wilson and Van Lint in their proof of the HLF. We then establish an
identity, which is really a special case of the equation mentioned above, and
show that the HLF follows from it. (Wilson and Van Lint prove this identity
directly, and use it to prove the HLF in a similar manner.) We then note the
appearance of an expression resembling the Weyl dimension formula and conclude
with a combinatorial result.",1310.5919v2,math.CO,2013-10-19 16:09:06+00:00,[arxiv.Result.Author('Graham Hawkes')],
246,Limiting Risk by Turning Manifest Phantoms into Evil Zombies,"Drawing a random sample of ballots to conduct a risk-limiting audit generally
requires knowing how the ballots cast in an election are organized into groups,
for instance, how many containers of ballots there are in all and how many
ballots are in each container. A list of the ballot group identifiers along
with number of ballots in each group is called a ballot manifest. What if the
ballot manifest is not accurate? Surprisingly, even if ballots are known to be
missing from the manifest, it is not necessary to make worst-case assumptions
about those ballots--for instance, to adjust the margin by the number of
missing ballots--to ensure that the audit remains conservative. Rather, it
suffices to make worst-case assumptions about the individual randomly selected
ballots that the audit cannot find. This observation provides a simple
modification to some risk-limiting audit procedures that makes them
automatically become more conservative if the ballot manifest has errors. The
modification--phantoms to evil zombies (~2EZ)--requires only an upper bound on
the total number of ballots cast. ~2EZ makes the audit P-value stochastically
larger than it would be had the manifest been accurate, automatically requiring
more than enough ballots to be audited to offset the manifest errors. This
ensures that the true risk limit remains smaller than the nominal risk limit.
On the other hand, if the manifest is in fact accurate and the upper bound on
the total number of ballots equals the total according to the manifest, ~2EZ
has no effect at all on the number of ballots audited nor on the true risk
limit.",1207.3413v1,stat.AP,2012-07-14 11:26:02+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Jorge H. Banuelos'), arxiv.Result.Author('Philip B. Stark')]",

printed ballot after making their selections on a Ballot Marking Device (BMD).
In this study, we altered votes on a voter's ballot after they had made their
selections on a BMD. We then required them to examine their ballots for any
changes from the slate they used to vote. Overall accuracy was exceptionally
high. Participants saw 1440 total contests, and of those 1440, there were a
total of 4 errors, so total accuracy was 99.8%. Participants were able to
perform with near-perfect accuracy regardless of ballot length, ballot type,
number of altered races, and location of altered races. Detection performance
was extremely robust. We conclude that with proper direction and resources,
voters can be near-perfect detectors of ballot changes on printed paper ballots
after voting with a BMD. This finding has significant implications for the
voting community as BMD use continues to grow. Research should now focus on
identifying administrative and behavioral methods that will prompt and

substantially grown, and in response, many election officials have added new
drop boxes to their voting infrastructure. However, existing guidance for
locating drop boxes is limited. In this paper, we introduce an integer
programming model, the drop box location problem (DBLP), to locate drop boxes.
The DBLP considers criteria of cost, voter access, and risk. The cost of the
drop box system is determined by the fixed cost of adding drop boxes and the
operational cost of a collection tour by a bipartisan team who regularly
collects ballots from selected locations. The DBLP utilizes covering sets to
ensure each voter is in close proximity to a drop box and incorporates a novel
measure of access to measure the ability to use multiple voting pathways to
vote. The DBLP is shown to be NP-Hard, and we introduce a heuristic to generate
a large number of feasible solutions for policy makers to select from a
posteriori. Using a real-world case study of Milwaukee, WI, we study the
benefit of the DBLP. The results demonstrate that the proposed optimization
model identifies drop box locations that perform well across multiple criteria.
The results also demonstrate that the trade-off between cost, access, and risk
is non-trivial, which supports the use of the proposed optimization-based
approach to select drop box locations.",2207.10707v2,math.OC,2022-07-21 18:41:38+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Adam P. Schmidt'), arxiv.Result.Author('Laura A. Albert')]",

approval-based multiwinner elections, where approval ballots range over
individual candidates instead of parties. Using techniques from both

D'Hondt apportionment method and that satisfy strong axioms which are
generalizations of properties commonly studied in the apportionment literature.
In fact, the rules we discuss provide representation guarantees that are

real ballots of any strict subset of districts at a price corresponding to the
willingness to sell on the part of the citizens holding such ballots. By
contrast, decoy voters are trapped into selling their ballots at a low, or even
negligible, price. Blowing up the adversary's budget by introducing decoy
ballots may thus turn out to be futile. The Devil's Menu can also be applied to

254,The ATHENA Class of Risk-Limiting Ballot Polling Audits,"The main risk-limiting ballot polling audit in use today, BRAVO, is designed
for use when single ballots are drawn at random and a decision regarding
whether to stop the audit or draw another ballot is taken after each ballot
draw (ballot-by-ballot (B2) audits). On the other hand, real ballot polling
audits draw many ballots in a single round before determining whether to stop
(round-by-round (R2) audits). We show that BRAVO results in significant
inefficiency when directly applied to real R2 audits. We present the ATHENA
class of R2 stopping rules, which we show are risk-limiting if the round
schedule is pre-determined (before the audit begins). We prove that each rule
is at least as efficient as the corresponding BRAVO stopping rule applied at
the end of the round. We have open-source software libraries implementing most
of our results.
  We show that ATHENA halves the number of ballots required, for all state
margins in the 2016 US Presidential election and a first round with $90\%$
stopping probability, when compared to BRAVO (stopping rule applied at the end
of the round). We present simulation results supporting the 90% stopping
probability claims and our claims for the risk accrued in the first round.
Further, ATHENA reduces the number of ballots by more than a quarter for low
margins, when compared to the BRAVO stopping rule applied on ballots in
selection order. This implies that keeping track of the order when drawing
ballots R2 is not beneficial, because ATHENA is more efficient even without
information on selection order. These results are significant because current
approaches to real ballot polling election audits use the B2 BRAVO rules,
requiring about twice as much work on the part of election officials. Applying
the rules in selection order requires fewer ballots, but keeping track of the
order, and entering it into audit software, adds to the effort.",2008.02315v5,cs.CR,2020-08-05 18:47:37+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Filip Zagórski'), arxiv.Result.Author('Grant McClearn'), arxiv.Result.Author('Sarah Morin'), arxiv.Result.Author('Neal McBurnett'), arxiv.Result.Author('Poorvi L.

not require identification numbers on the ballots or counting many ballots per

surrounded by two ballot paths. We study the relations of combinatorial objects
which are bijective to symmetric Dyck tilings such as labeled trees, Hermite
histories, and perfect matchings. We also introduce two operations on labeled
trees for symmetric Dyck tilings: symmetric Dyck tiling strip (symDTS) and
symmetric Dyck tiling ribbon (symDTR). We give two definitions of Hermite
histories for symmetric Dyck tilings, and show that they are equivalent by use
of the correspondence between symDTS operation and an Hermite history. Since
ballot tilings form a subset in the set of symmetric Dyck tilings, we construct
an inclusive map from labeled trees for ballot tilings to labeled trees for
symmetric Dyck tilings. By this inclusive map, the results for symmetric Dyck
tilings can be applied to those of ballot tilings. We introduce and study the

258,SOBA: Secrecy-preserving Observable Ballot-level Audit,"SOBA is an approach to election verification that provides observers with
justifiably high confidence that the reported results of an election are
consistent with an audit trail (""ballots""), which can be paper or electronic.
SOBA combines three ideas: (1) publishing cast vote records (CVRs) separately
for each contest, so that anyone can verify that each reported contest outcome
is correct, if the CVRs reflect voters' intentions with sufficient accuracy;
(2) shrouding a mapping between ballots and the CVRs for those ballots to
prevent the loss of privacy that could occur otherwise; (3) assessing the
accuracy with which the CVRs reflect voters' intentions for a collection of
contests while simultaneously assessing the integrity of the shrouded mapping
between ballots and CVRs by comparing randomly selected ballots to the CVRs
that purport to represent them. Step (1) is related to work by the Humboldt
County Election Transparency Project, but publishing CVRs separately for
individual contests rather than images of entire ballots preserves privacy.
Step (2) requires a cryptographic commitment from elections officials.
Observers participate in step (3), which relies on the ""super-simple
simultaneous single-ballot risk-limiting audit."" Step (3) is designed to reveal
relatively few ballots if the shrouded mapping is proper and the CVRs
accurately reflect voter intent. But if the reported outcomes of the contests
differ from the outcomes that a full hand count would show, step (3) is
guaranteed to have a large chance of requiring all the ballots to be counted by
hand, thereby limiting the risk that an incorrect outcome will become official
and final.",1105.5803v2,stat.AP,2011-05-29 17:00:20+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Josh Benaloh'), arxiv.Result.Author('Douglas Jones'), arxiv.Result.Author('Eric Lazarus'), arxiv.Result.Author('Mark Lindeman'), arxiv.Result.Author('Philip B. Stark')]",
259,"Voter Verification of BMD Ballots Is a Two-Part Question: Can They? Mostly, They Can. Do They? Mostly, They Don't","The question of whether or not voters actually verify ballots produced by
ballot marking devices (BMDs) is presently the subject of some controversy.
Recent studies (e.g., Bernhard, et al. 2020) suggest the verification rate is
low. What is not clear from previous research is whether this is more a result
of voters being unable to do so accurately or whether this is because voters
simply choose not to attempt verification in the first place. In order to
understand this problem, we conducted an experiment in which 108 participants
participated in a mock election where the BMD displayed the voters' true
choices, but then changed a subset of those choices on the printed ballot. The
design of the printed ballot, the length of the ballot, the number of changes
that were made to the ballot, the location of those changes, and the
instructions provided to the voters were manipulated as part of the experiment.
Results indicated that of those voters who chose to examine the printed ballot,
76% detected anomalies, indicating that voters can reliably detect errors on
their ballot if they will simply review it. This suggests that administrative
remedies, rather than attempts to alter fundamental human perceptual
capabilities, could be employed to encourage voters to check their ballots,
which could prove as an effective countermeasure.",2003.04997v1,cs.HC,2020-03-10 21:06:42+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Philip Kortum'), arxiv.Result.Author('Michael D. Byrne'), arxiv.Result.Author('Julie Whitmore')]",
260,Robust Lane Marking Detection Algorithm Using Drivable Area Segmentation and Extended SLT,"In this paper, a robust lane detection algorithm is proposed, where the
vertical road profile of the road is estimated using dynamic programming from
the v-disparity map and, based on the estimated profile, the road area is
segmented. Since the lane markings are on the road area and any feature point
above the ground will be a noise source for the lane detection, a mask is
created for the road area to remove some of the noise for lane detection. The
estimated mask is multiplied by the lane feature map in a bird's eye view
(BEV). The lane feature points are extracted by using an extended version of
symmetrical local threshold (SLT), which not only considers dark light dark
transition (DLD) of the lane markings, like (SLT), but also considers
parallelism on the lane marking borders. The segmentation then uses only the
feature points that are on the road area. A maximum of two linear lane markings
are detected using an efficient 1D Hough transform. Then, the detected linear
lane markings are used to create a region of interest (ROI) for parabolic lane
detection. Finally, based on the estimated region of interest, parabolic lane
models are fitted using robust fitting. Due to the robust lane feature
extraction and road area segmentation, the proposed algorithm robustly detects
lane markings and achieves lane marking detection with an accuracy of 91% when
tested on a sequence from the KITTI dataset.",1911.09054v1,cs.RO,2019-11-20 17:34:31+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Umar Ozgunalp'), arxiv.Result.Author('Rui Fan'), arxiv.Result.Author('Shanshan Cheng'), arxiv.Result.Author('Yuxiang Sun'), arxiv.Result.Author('Weixun Zuo'), arxiv.Result.Author('Yilong Zhu'), arxiv.Result.Author('Bohuan Xue'), arxiv.Result.Author('Linwei Zheng'), arxiv.Result.Author('Qing Liang'), arxiv.Result.Author('Ming Liu')]",

broadcast, providing richer experiences and valuable insights to fans. The
first step of augmented reality systems is camera calibration, possibly based
on detecting the line markings of the playing field. Most existing proposals
for line detection rely on edge detection and Hough transform, but radial
distortion and extraneous edges cause inaccurate or spurious detections of line
markings. We propose a novel strategy to automatically and accurately segment
and classify line markings. First, line points are segmented thanks to a
stochastic watershed transform that is robust to radial distortions, since it
makes no assumptions about line straightness, and is unaffected by the presence
of players or the ball. The line points are then linked to primitive structures
(straight lines and ellipses) thanks to a very efficient procedure that makes
no assumptions about the number of primitives that appear in each image. The
strategy has been tested on a new and public database composed by 60 annotated
images from matches in five stadiums. The results obtained have proven that the
proposed strategy is more robust and accurate than existing approaches,

265,Detecting Lane and Road Markings at A Distance with Perspective Transformer Layers,"Accurate detection of lane and road markings is a task of great importance
for intelligent vehicles. In existing approaches, the detection accuracy often
degrades with the increasing distance. This is due to the fact that distant
lane and road markings occupy a small number of pixels in the image, and scales
of lane and road markings are inconsistent at various distances and
perspectives. The Inverse Perspective Mapping (IPM) can be used to eliminate
the perspective distortion, but the inherent interpolation can lead to
artifacts especially around distant lane and road markings and thus has a
negative impact on the accuracy of lane marking detection and segmentation. To
solve this problem, we adopt the Encoder-Decoder architecture in Fully
Convolutional Networks and leverage the idea of Spatial Transformer Networks to
introduce a novel semantic segmentation neural network. This approach
decomposes the IPM process into multiple consecutive differentiable homographic
transform layers, which are called ""Perspective Transformer Layers"".
Furthermore, the interpolated feature map is refined by subsequent
convolutional layers thus reducing the artifacts and improving the accuracy.

270,Vision-Based Lane Detection and Tracking under Different Challenging Environmental Conditions,"Driving is very challenging when the visibility of a road lane marking is
low, obscured or often invisible due to abrupt environmental change which may
lead to severe vehicle clash. A large volume of research has been done on lane
marking detection. Most of the lane detection methods suffer from four types of
major problems: (i) abrupt illumination change due to change in time (day,
night), weather, road, etc.; (ii) lane markings get obscured partially or fully
when they are colored, eroded or occluded; (iii) blurred view created by
adverse weather like rain or snow; and (iv) incorrect lane detection due to
presence of other lookalike lines e.g. guardrails, pavement marking, road
divider, vehicle lines, the shadow of trees, etc. In this paper, we proposed a
robust lane detection and tracking method to detect lane marking considering
the abovementioned challenging conditions. In this method, we introduced three
key technologies. First, the bilateral filter is applied to smooth and preserve
the edges and we introduced an optimized intensity threshold range (OITR) to
improve the performance of the canny operator which detects the edges of low
intensity (colored, eroded, or blurred) lane markings. Second, we proposed a
robust lane verification technique, the angle and length-based geometric
constraint (ALGC) algorithm followed by Hough Transform, to verify the
characteristics of lane marking and to prevent incorrect lane detection.
Finally, a novel lane tracking technique, the horizontally adjustable lane
repositioning range (HALRR) algorithm is proposed, which can keep track of the
lane position. To evaluate the performance of the proposed method we used the
DSDLDE dataset with 1080x1920 resolutions at 24 frames/sec. Experimental
results show that the average detection rate is 97.36%, and the average

followed by Hough voting to generate corresponding detection of the border and
lane marking. Since the initially triggered detectors usually result in large
number of positives, conventional frame-wise Hough voting is not able to always
generate robust border and lane marking results. Therefore, we formulate this
problem as a joint detection-and-tracking problem under the structured Hough
voting model, where tracking refers to exploiting inter-frame structural
information to stabilize the detection results. Both qualitative and

reversible random walk $P$ on the graph. In the case of multiple marked
elements, the number of steps is given in terms of a related quantity
$HT^+(\mathit{P,M})$ which we call extended hitting time.
  Our approach is new, simpler and more general than previous ones. We
introduce a notion of interpolation between the random walk $P$ and the
absorbing walk $P'$, whose marked states are absorbing. Then our quantum walk
is simply the quantum analogue of this interpolation. Contrary to previous
approaches, our results remain valid when the random walk $P$ is not
state-transitive. We also provide algorithms in the cases when only
approximations or bounds on parameters $p_M$ (the probability of picking a

appropriate agile practices and eliciting their effects. For this reason, we
per-formed a pre and post process assessment using interviews. Based on the
initial assessment, agile practices were selected and implemented. Finally, the
post assessment and additional code metrics served as controlling mechanism to
check whether weak points are addressed. The comparison of the two assessments

overlooked, must be confronted when transferring the HAC estimation technology
to time series environments. First, most economic time series have strong
autocorrelation, which renders HAC regression parameter estimates highly
inefficient. Second, strong autocorrelation similarly renders HAC conditional
predictions highly inefficient. Finally, the structure of most popular HAC
estimators is ill-suited to capture the autoregressive autocorrelation
typically present in economic time series, which produces large size
distortions and reduced power in hypothesis testing, in all but the largest
sample sizes. We show that all three problems are largely avoided by the use of

Then we introduce a much more sophisticated feature-engineered machine learning

them to a FELR benchmark. Our substantive results include the frequent
appearance of predictability thresholds, which differ across months, meaning
that accuracy initially fails to improve as the target date is approached but

Redactable signature is useful for such a situation. However, in most

least linear in l. As far as we know, in some redactable signature schemes, the
number of elements in an original signature is constant, regardless of the
number of elements in a message to be signed. However, these constructions have
drawbacks in that the use of the random oracle model or generic group model. In

board. The new scheme has three advantages: it does not utilize entangled
states while it can preserve all merits in the existing schemes; the
integrality of the signature can avoid being disavowed by the receiver; and, it
provides a higher efficiency in transmission and reduces the complexity of
implementation. Furthermore, we present a technique such that the quantum
message can keep secret to the arbitrator in a arbitrated quantum signature
scheme.",1003.2337v1,quant-ph,2010-03-11 14:22:24+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Xiangfu Zou'), arxiv.Result.Author('Daowen Qiu')]",
315,Ultra Lightweight Multiple-time Digital Signature for the Internet of Things Devices,"Digital signatures are basic cryptographic tools to provide authentication
and integrity in the emerging ubiquitous systems in which resource-constrained
devices are expected to operate securely and efficiently. However, existing
digital signatures might not be fully practical for such resource-constrained
devices (e.g., medical implants) that have energy limitations. Some other
computationally efficient alternatives (e.g., one-time/multiple-time
signatures) may introduce high memory and/or communication overhead due to
large private key and signature sizes.
  In this paper, our contributions are two-fold: First, we develop a new
lightweight multiple-time digital signature scheme called Signer Efficient
Multiple-time Elliptic Curve Signature (SEMECS), which is suitable for
resource-constrained embedded devices. SEMECS achieves optimal signature and
private key sizes for an EC-based signature without requiring any EC operation
(e.g., EC scalar multiplication or addition) at the signer. We prove SEMECS is
secure (in random oracle model) with a tight security reduction. Second, we
fully implemented SEMECS on 8-bit AVR microprocessor with a comprehensive
energy consumption analysis and comparison. Our experiments confirm up to 19x
less battery-consumption for SEMECS as compared to its fastest (full-time)
counterpart, SchnorrQ, while offering significant performance advantages over
its multiple-time counterparts in various fronts. We open-source our

impersonation, repudiation and message tampering. Currently used classical
digital signature schemes rely on public key encryption techniques, where the
complexity of so-called ""one-way"" mathematical functions is used to provide
security over sufficiently long timescales. No mathematical proofs are known
for the long-term security of such techniques. Quantum digital signatures offer
a means of sending a message which cannot be forged or repudiated, with
security verified by information-theoretical limits and quantum mechanics. Here
we demonstrate an experimental system which distributes quantum signatures from
one sender to two receivers and enables message sending ensured against forging
and repudiation. Additionally, we analyse the security of the system in some
typical scenarios. The system is based on the interference of phase encoded
coherent states of light and our implementation utilises polarisation

the message. Different from classical digital signatures, whose security
depends on computational complexity, quantum digital signatures (QDS) can
provide information-theoretic security. We propose a general method of random
pairing QDS (RP-QDS), which can drastically improve QDS efficiency. In a way,
our random pairing method provide a tightened result of security level of QDS.
In the method, the parity value of each pair is used for the outcome bit value.
We present general formulas for fraction of untagged bits and error rates of
the outcome bits. Random pairing can be applied as a fundamental method to
improve the QDS efficiency for all existing quantum key distribution (QKD)
protocols. We take sending-or-not-sending (SNS) QDS and side-channel-free (SCF)
QDS as examples to demonstrate the advantage of random pairing through
numerical simulation. Similar advantage with random pairing is also founded
with decoy-state MDIQKD and also decoy-state BB84 protocol. We study the
RP-SNS-QDS with finite data size through novel optimization. The numerical
simulation results show that the signature rate can be increased by more than
100% under noisy channel using our random pairing method.",2201.10530v1,quant-ph,2022-01-25 18:36:38+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Ji-Qian Qin'), arxiv.Result.Author('Cong Jiang'), arxiv.Result.Author('Yun-Long Yu'), arxiv.Result.Author('Xiang-Bin Wang')]",
320,Shared-Dining: Broadcasting Secret Shares using Dining-Cryptographers Groups,"A k-anonymous broadcast can be implemented using a small group of dining
cryptographers to first share the message, followed by a flooding phase started
by group members. Members have little incentive to forward the message in a
timely manner, as forwarding incurs costs, or they may even profit from keeping
the message. In worst case, this leaves the true originator as the only sender,
rendering the dining-cryptographers phase useless and compromising their
privacy. We present a novel approach using a modified dining-cryptographers
protocol to distributed shares of an (n,k)-Shamir's secret sharing scheme.
Finally, all group members broadcast their received share through the network,
allowing any recipient of k shares to reconstruct the message, enforcing
anonymity. If less than k group members broadcast their shares, the message
cannot be decoded thus preventing privacy breaches for the originator. Our
system provides (n-|attackers|)-anonymity for up to k-1 attackers and has
little performance impact on dissemination. We show these results in a security
analysis and performance evaluation based on a proof-of-concept prototype.

among participants. In previous but preliminary work, we proposed a threephase
approach with an initial phase based on a DCN with a group size of k while
later phases take care of the actual broadcast within a peer-to-peer network.
This paper describes our DCN protocol in detail and adds a performance
evaluation powered by our proof-of-concept implementation. Our contributions
are (i) an extension of the DCN protocol by von Ahn for fair delivery of
arbitrarily long messages sent by potentially multiple senders, (ii) a privacy
and security analysis of this extension, (iii) various performance optimisation
especially for best-case operation, and (iv) a performance evaluation. The
latter uses a latency of 100 ms and a bandwidth limit of 50 Mbit/s between
participants. The interquartile range of the largest test of the highly secured
version took 35s+-1.25s for a full run. All tests of the optimized common-case

324,A Survey on Anonymous Communication Systems with a Focus on Dining Cryptographers Networks,"Traffic analysis attacks can counteract end-to-end encryption and use the
leaked communication metadata to reveal information about the communicating
parties. With an ever-increasing amount of traffic by an ever-increasing amount
of networked devices, this undermines communication privacy and goes against
the uptrend of limiting personal data collection. Therefore, Anonymous
Communication Systems (ACSs) are proposed to protect the users' privacy by
hiding the relationship between transmitted messages and their senders and
receivers, providing privacy properties known as anonymity, unlinkability and
unobservability. This article aims to review the research in the ACSs field
based on its applicability in real-world scenarios. First, we present an
overview of the underlying principles of ACSs and different methods. Then, we
focus on Dining Cryptographers Networks (DCNs) and the methods for anonymous
communication that are based on them. We investigate the alignment of ACSs with
the privacy terminologies. Most notably, the DCN-based methods are
information-theoretically secure and thus provide unconditional unobservability
guarantees. Their initial adoption for anonymous communications was hindered
initially as their computational and communication overhead was deemed too
significant at that time and scalability problems occurred. However, several
more recent contributions such as the possibility to transmit arbitrary length
messages, efficient handling of disruptors and improvements in overhead made
the integration of modern DCN-based methods more realistic. Previous surveys on
ACSs did not cover the most recent research advances in this area or did not
focus on DCN-based methods. This comprehensive investigation of modern ACSs and
DCN-based systems closes this gap.",2212.08275v1,cs.CR,2022-12-16 04:23:16+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Mohsen Shirali'), arxiv.Result.Author('Tobias Tefke'), arxiv.Result.Author('Ralf C. Staudemeyer'), arxiv.Result.Author('Henrich C. Poehls')]",

its path through the network. However, as this increases the end-to-end latency
it is not ideal for applications like Voice-over-IP (VoIP) communication, where
participants will notice annoying delays if the data does not arrive fast
enough. We propose an approach based on the paradigm of Dining Cryptographer
networks (DC-nets) that can be used to realize untraceable communication within
small groups. The main features of our approach are low latency and resilience

communication latency of prior work via a new client/relay/server architecture,
in which a client's packets remain on their usual network path without
additional hops, and in which a set of remote servers assist the anonymization
process without adding latency. PriFi also solves the challenge of equivocation

329,DINE: Domain Adaptation from Single and Multiple Black-box Predictors,"To ease the burden of labeling, unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) aims to
transfer knowledge in previous and related labeled datasets (sources) to a new
unlabeled dataset (target). Despite impressive progress, prior methods always
need to access the raw source data and develop data-dependent alignment
approaches to recognize the target samples in a transductive learning manner,
which may raise privacy concerns from source individuals. Several recent
studies resort to an alternative solution by exploiting the well-trained
white-box model from the source domain, yet, it may still leak the raw data
through generative adversarial learning. This paper studies a practical and
interesting setting for UDA, where only black-box source models (i.e., only
network predictions are available) are provided during adaptation in the target
domain. To solve this problem, we propose a new two-step knowledge adaptation
framework called DIstill and fine-tuNE (DINE). Taking into consideration the
target data structure, DINE first distills the knowledge from the source
predictor to a customized target model, then fine-tunes the distilled model to
further fit the target domain. Besides, neural networks are not required to be
identical across domains in DINE, even allowing effective adaptation on a
low-resource device. Empirical results on three UDA scenarios (i.e.,
single-source, multi-source, and partial-set) confirm that DINE achieves highly
competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art data-dependent approaches.

complete the missing part including both nodes and edges in a partially

the embedding performance, we consider both network structures and node

infinite family is a dining philosopher protocol with any number n of processes
(n being the parameter that defines the infinite family). Regular model
checking is a well-known generic framework for modelling parameterised
concurrent systems, where an infinite set of configurations (resp. transitions)
is represented by a regular set (resp. regular transducer). Although verifying
safety properties in the regular model checking framework is undecidable in
general, many sophisticated semi-algorithms have been developed in the past
fifteen years that can successfully prove safety in many practical instances.
In this paper, we propose a simple solution to synthesise regular inductive
invariants that makes use of Angluin's classic L* algorithm (and its variants).
We provide a termination guarantee when the set of configurations reachable
from a given set of initial configurations is regular. We have tested L*

CTLK. In this paper, we use the technique of Ordered Binary Decision Diagrams
(OBDD) to encode RGER in order to alleviate the state explosion problem and
enhance the verification efficiency. We propose a heuristic method to order
those variables in OBDD, which can well improve the time and space performance
of producing, encoding and exploring a huge state space. More importantly, our
method does not produce and encode any transition or equivalence relation of
states when producing and encoding an RGER, and in fact it dynamically produces
those transition or equivalence relations that are required in the verification
process of CTLK formulas. This policy can save a lot of time and space since
the number of transition or equivalence relations of states is much greater
than the number of states themselves. We design symbolic model checking
algorithms, develop a tool and apply them to two famous examples: Alice-Bob

including specifications describing what an agent knows about other agents'
knowledge. This result can be used to optimize model checking of Dining

knowledge-based program implementation and verification. Some case studies of

344,Shared-Dining: Broadcasting Secret Shares using Dining-Cryptographers Groups,"A k-anonymous broadcast can be implemented using a small group of dining
cryptographers to first share the message, followed by a flooding phase started
by group members. Members have little incentive to forward the message in a
timely manner, as forwarding incurs costs, or they may even profit from keeping
the message. In worst case, this leaves the true originator as the only sender,
rendering the dining-cryptographers phase useless and compromising their
privacy. We present a novel approach using a modified dining-cryptographers
protocol to distributed shares of an (n,k)-Shamir's secret sharing scheme.
Finally, all group members broadcast their received share through the network,
allowing any recipient of k shares to reconstruct the message, enforcing
anonymity. If less than k group members broadcast their shares, the message
cannot be decoded thus preventing privacy breaches for the originator. Our
system provides (n-|attackers|)-anonymity for up to k-1 attackers and has
little performance impact on dissemination. We show these results in a security
analysis and performance evaluation based on a proof-of-concept prototype.

concurrent systems, i.e., an infinite family of finite-state concurrent systems
that are represented by some finite (symbolic) means. An example of such an
infinite family is a dining philosopher protocol with any number n of processes
(n being the parameter that defines the infinite family). Regular model
checking is a well-known generic framework for modelling parameterised
concurrent systems, where an infinite set of configurations (resp. transitions)
is represented by a regular set (resp. regular transducer). Although verifying
safety properties in the regular model checking framework is undecidable in
general, many sophisticated semi-algorithms have been developed in the past
fifteen years that can successfully prove safety in many practical instances.
In this paper, we propose a simple solution to synthesise regular inductive
invariants that makes use of Angluin's classic L* algorithm (and its variants).
We provide a termination guarantee when the set of configurations reachable
from a given set of initial configurations is regular. We have tested L*
algorithm on standard (as well as new) examples in regular model checking
including the dining philosopher protocol, the dining cryptographer protocol,
and several mutual exclusion protocols (e.g. Bakery, Burns, Szymanski, and
German). Our experiments show that, despite the simplicity of our solution, it

347,A Survey on Anonymous Communication Systems with a Focus on Dining Cryptographers Networks,"Traffic analysis attacks can counteract end-to-end encryption and use the
leaked communication metadata to reveal information about the communicating
parties. With an ever-increasing amount of traffic by an ever-increasing amount
of networked devices, this undermines communication privacy and goes against
the uptrend of limiting personal data collection. Therefore, Anonymous
Communication Systems (ACSs) are proposed to protect the users' privacy by
hiding the relationship between transmitted messages and their senders and
receivers, providing privacy properties known as anonymity, unlinkability and
unobservability. This article aims to review the research in the ACSs field
based on its applicability in real-world scenarios. First, we present an
overview of the underlying principles of ACSs and different methods. Then, we
focus on Dining Cryptographers Networks (DCNs) and the methods for anonymous
communication that are based on them. We investigate the alignment of ACSs with
the privacy terminologies. Most notably, the DCN-based methods are
information-theoretically secure and thus provide unconditional unobservability
guarantees. Their initial adoption for anonymous communications was hindered
initially as their computational and communication overhead was deemed too
significant at that time and scalability problems occurred. However, several
more recent contributions such as the possibility to transmit arbitrary length
messages, efficient handling of disruptors and improvements in overhead made
the integration of modern DCN-based methods more realistic. Previous surveys on
ACSs did not cover the most recent research advances in this area or did not
focus on DCN-based methods. This comprehensive investigation of modern ACSs and
DCN-based systems closes this gap.",2212.08275v1,cs.CR,2022-12-16 04:23:16+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Mohsen Shirali'), arxiv.Result.Author('Tobias Tefke'), arxiv.Result.Author('Ralf C. Staudemeyer'), arxiv.Result.Author('Henrich C. Poehls')]",

requirements of privacy and security of multi-agent systems (MAS). In our
conference paper, we defined Knowledge-oriented Petri Nets (KPN) to model MAS
and proposed Reachability Graphs with Equivalence Relations (RGER) to verify
CTLK. In this paper, we use the technique of Ordered Binary Decision Diagrams
(OBDD) to encode RGER in order to alleviate the state explosion problem and
enhance the verification efficiency. We propose a heuristic method to order
those variables in OBDD, which can well improve the time and space performance
of producing, encoding and exploring a huge state space. More importantly, our
method does not produce and encode any transition or equivalence relation of
states when producing and encoding an RGER, and in fact it dynamically produces
those transition or equivalence relations that are required in the verification
process of CTLK formulas. This policy can save a lot of time and space since
the number of transition or equivalence relations of states is much greater
than the number of states themselves. We design symbolic model checking
algorithms, develop a tool and apply them to two famous examples: Alice-Bob
Protocol and Dining Cryptographers Protocol. We compare our tool with MCMAS
which is the state-of-the-art model checker of verifying CTLK. The experimental
results illustrate the advantages of our model and method. Our tool running in

MDL. We show that MIL embeds MDL and is strictly more expressive. However, on
singleton teams, MIL is shown to be not more expressive than usual modal logic,
but MIL is exponentially more succinct. Making use of a new form of
bisimulation, we extend these expressivity results to modal logics extended by
various generalized dependence atoms. We demonstrate the expressive power of
MIL by giving a specification of the anonymity requirement of the dining
cryptographers protocol in MIL. We also study complexity issues of MIL and show
that, though it is more expressive, its satisfiability and model checking

its path through the network. However, as this increases the end-to-end latency
it is not ideal for applications like Voice-over-IP (VoIP) communication, where
participants will notice annoying delays if the data does not arrive fast
enough. We propose an approach based on the paradigm of Dining Cryptographer

small groups. The main features of our approach are low latency and resilience

the spirit of software verification, wherein we encode proof rules for
probabilistic bisimulation and use a decidable first-order theory to specify
systems and candidate bisimulation relations, which can then be checked
automatically against the proof rules. As a case study, we show that our
framework is sufficiently expressive for proving the anonymity property of the
parameterized dining cryptographers protocol and the parameterized grades

at hand and evaluate the specification with statistical confidence. The main
benefit of applying SMC over exhaustive techniques is its efficiency and
scalability. To reason about probabilistic hyperproperties, we first propose
the temporal logic HyperPCLT* that extends PCTL* and HyperPCTL. We show that
HyperPCLT* can express important probabilistic information-flow security

algorithms for verifying HyperPCLT* formulas on discrete-time Markov chains,
based on sequential probability ratio tests (SPRT) with a new notion of
multi-dimensional indifference region. Our SMC algorithms can handle both
non-nested and nested probability operators for any desired significance level.
To show the effectiveness of our technique, we evaluate our SMC algorithms on

356,DINE: Domain Adaptation from Single and Multiple Black-box Predictors,"To ease the burden of labeling, unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) aims to
transfer knowledge in previous and related labeled datasets (sources) to a new
unlabeled dataset (target). Despite impressive progress, prior methods always
need to access the raw source data and develop data-dependent alignment
approaches to recognize the target samples in a transductive learning manner,
which may raise privacy concerns from source individuals. Several recent
studies resort to an alternative solution by exploiting the well-trained
white-box model from the source domain, yet, it may still leak the raw data
through generative adversarial learning. This paper studies a practical and
interesting setting for UDA, where only black-box source models (i.e., only
network predictions are available) are provided during adaptation in the target
domain. To solve this problem, we propose a new two-step knowledge adaptation
framework called DIstill and fine-tuNE (DINE). Taking into consideration the
target data structure, DINE first distills the knowledge from the source
predictor to a customized target model, then fine-tunes the distilled model to
further fit the target domain. Besides, neural networks are not required to be
identical across domains in DINE, even allowing effective adaptation on a
low-resource device. Empirical results on three UDA scenarios (i.e.,
single-source, multi-source, and partial-set) confirm that DINE achieves highly
competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art data-dependent approaches.

Dine-Fischler-Srednicki-Zhitnitsky (DFSZ) type model, which provides a solution
to the strong CP problem and generates a SUSY mu-term and right-handed neutrino
masses. If the PQ scale during lepton number generation is much larger than the
present value, leptogenesis is very efficient so that enough baryon number can
be generated without introducing a hierarchically small neutrino mass. The
final baryon asymmetry is related to the mu-term, and hence linked to the level
of electroweak fine-tuning. We also show the PQ breaking scalar dynamics that
keeps a large PQ breaking scale during inflation and lepton number generation.

the research effort is put into developing protocols and machines for poll-site

This paper presents a scheme based on combination of mixnets and homomorphic
encryption borrowed from robust poll-site voting, along with techniques
recommended for remote voting -- code sheets and test ballots. The protocol
tries to minimize the trust put in voter's PC by making the voter responsible
for manual encryption of his vote. To achieve this, the voter obtains a paper
ballot that allows him to scramble the vote by performing simple operations
(lookup in a table). Creation of paper ballots, as well as decryption of votes,
is performed by a group of cooperating trusted servers. As a result, the scheme
is characterized by strong asymmetry -- all computations are carried out on the

366,Vulnerability analysis of three remote voting methods,"This article analyses three methods of remote voting in an uncontrolled
environment: postal voting, internet voting and hybrid voting. It breaks down
the voting process into different stages and compares their vulnerabilities
considering criteria that must be respected in any democratic vote:
confidentiality, anonymity, transparency, vote unicity and authenticity.
Whether for safety or reliability, each vulnerability is quantified by three
parameters: size, visibility and difficulty to achieve. The study concludes
that the automatisation of treatments combined with the dematerialisation of
the objects used during an election tends to substitute visible vulnerabilities
of a lesser magnitude by invisible and widespread vulnerabilities.",0908.1059v1,cs.CY,2009-08-07 14:02:40+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Chantal Enguehard'), arxiv.Result.Author('Rémi Lehn')]","XXI IPSA World Congress of Political Science, RC10 Electronic

367,In Search of the Black Swan: Analysis of the Statistical Evidence of Electoral Fraud in Venezuela,"This study analyzes diverse hypotheses of electronic fraud in the Recall
Referendum celebrated in Venezuela on August 15, 2004. We define fraud as the
difference between the elector's intent, and the official vote tally. Our null
hypothesis is that there was no fraud, and we attempt to search for evidence
that will allow us to reject this hypothesis. We find no evidence that fraud
was committed by applying numerical maximums to machines in some precincts.
Equally, we discard any hypothesis that implies altering some machines and not
others, at each electoral precinct, because the variation patterns between
machines at each precinct are normal. However, the statistical evidence is
compatible with the occurrence of fraud that has affected every machine in a
single precinct, but differentially more in some precincts than others. We find
that the deviation pattern between precincts, based on the relationship between
the signatures collected to request the referendum in November 2003 (the
so-called, Reafirmazo), and the YES votes on August 15, is positive and
significantly correlated with the deviation pattern in the relationship between
exit polls and votes in those same precincts. In other words, those precincts
in which, according to the number of signatures, there are an unusually low
number of YES votes (i.e., votes to impeach the president), is also where,
according to the exit polls, the same thing occurs.",1205.3921v1,stat.ME,2012-05-17 12:52:40+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Ricardo Hausmann'), arxiv.Result.Author('Roberto Rigobon')]","Statistical Science 2011, Vol. 26, No. 4, 543-563"

Multi-choice Voting/Ranking (DMVR) algorithm to determine either the choice
with maximum vote (the voting problem) or to rank all the choices in terms of
their acquired votes (the ranking problem). The algorithm consolidates node
votes across the network by updating the states of interacting nodes using two
key operations, the union and the intersection. The proposed algorithm is
simple, independent from network size, and easily scalable in terms of the
number of choices $K$, using only $K\times 2^{K-1}$ nodal states for voting,
and $K\times K!$ nodal states for ranking. We prove the number of states to be
optimal in the ranking case, this optimality is conjectured to also apply to
the voting case. The time complexity of the algorithm is analyzed in complete
graphs. We show that the time complexity for both ranking and voting is
$O(\log(n))$ for given vote percentages, and is inversely proportional to the
minimum of the vote percentage differences among various choices.",1703.08838v1,cs.DC,2017-03-26 16:19:31+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Saber Salehkaleybar'), arxiv.Result.Author('Arsalan Sharif-Nassab'), arxiv.Result.Author('S. Jamaloddin Golestani')]",

370,Tradeoffs in Hierarchical Voting Systems,"Condorcet's jury theorem states that the correct outcome is reached in direct
majority voting systems with sufficiently large electorates as long as each
voter's independent probability of voting for that outcome is greater than 0.5.
Yet, in situations where direct voting systems are infeasible, such as due to
high implementation and infrastructure costs, hierarchical voting systems
provide a reasonable alternative. We study differences in outcome precision
between hierarchical and direct voting systems for varying group sizes,
abstention rates, and voter competencies. Using asymptotic expansions of the
derivative of the reliability function (or Banzhaf number), we first prove that
indirect systems differ most from their direct counterparts when group size and
number are equal to each other, and therefore to $\sqrt{N_{\rm d}}$, where
$N_{\rm d}$ is the total number of voters in the direct system. In multitier
systems, we prove that this difference is maximized when group size equals
$\sqrt[n]{N_{\rm d}}$, where $n$ is the number of hierarchical levels. Second,
we show that while direct majority rule always outperforms hierarchical voting
for homogeneous electorates that vote with certainty, as group numbers and size
increase, hierarchical majority voting gains in its ability to represent all
eligible voters. Furthermore, when voter abstention and competency are
correlated within groups, hierarchical systems often outperform direct voting,
which we show by using a generating function approach that is able to
analytically characterize heterogeneous voting systems.",2110.02298v1,math.CO,2021-10-05 19:01:52+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Lucas Böttcher'), arxiv.Result.Author('Georgia Kernell')]","Collect. Intell. 1, 1--16 (2022)"

current Hungarian electoral rules. It combines single-seat districts and list
mandates with three possible compensation rule for 'wasted' votes in
constituencies: no compensation (direct vote transfer, DVT), compensation for
votes cast for losing party candidates (positive vote transfer, PVT) and
compensation for all votes that are not necessary to win the district (negative
vote transfer, NVT).
  The model is studied in the case of two parties. When the number of votes for
the majority party follows a uniform distribution in each district, DVT results
in the greatest expected seat share, however, application of PVT, and,
especially, NVT increases the probability of winning the election. The
trade-off between vote transfer formulas and the number of list mandates
reveals that the majority party should use an appropriately calibrated NVT
system if it focuses on these two variables.",1607.02879v3,cs.GT,2016-07-11 09:58:58+00:00,[arxiv.Result.Author('László Csató')],
373,$Laoco\ddot{o}n$: Scalable and Portable Receipt-free E-voting Protocol without Untappable Channels,"Vote-buying and voter-coercion are the impending threats when deploying
remote online voting into large scale elections. With a policy of carrot and
stick, it will encourage voters to deviate from honest voting strategy and

receipt-free voting protocols either rely on some impractical assumptions as
untappable communication channel, or are burden with heavy voter-side
computation and quadratic tallying complexity. In this paper, we present
$Laoco\ddot{o}n$, a brand new cryptographic voting protocol which is practical
and light-weight to be deployed in large scale online elections. By taking
advantage of proxy re-encryption, our protocol can defend vote-buying attacks.
Furthermore, we introduce a new property, candidate-adaptiveness, in electronic

be allowed to rank at most four candidates. I identify all pivotal events in
terms of the ballots that a voter expects to be cast, and then I compute those
probabilities in a common framework for voting games. I provide pseudocode, and
work through an example of calculating pivotal probabilities. I then compare

391,Exclusive dielectron production in ultraperipheral Pb+Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{_\text{NN}}} = 5.02$ TeV with ATLAS,"Exclusive production of dielectron pairs, $\gamma\gamma\rightarrow e^+e^-$,

from ultraperipheral collisions of lead nuclei at $\sqrt{s_{_{\text{NN}}}} =
5.02$ TeV recorded by the ATLAS detector at the LHC. The process of interest
proceeds via photon-photon interaction in the strong electromagnetic fields of
relativistic lead nuclei. Dielectron production is measured in the fiducial
region defined by following requirements: electron transverse momentum,
$p_{\textrm{T}}^{e} > 2.5$ GeV, absolute electron pseudorapidity, $|\eta^{e}| <
2.5$, invariant mass of the dielectron system, $m_{ee} > 5$ GeV, and transverse
momentum of the dielecton pair, $p_{\textrm{T}}^{ee} < 2$ GeV. Differential
cross-sections are measured as a function of $m_{ee}$, average
$p_{\textrm{T}}^{e}$, absolute rapidity of the dielectron system, $|y_{ee}|$,
and scattering angle in the dielectron rest frame, $|\cos\theta^*|$ in the
inclusive sample, and also under the requirement of no activity in the forward
direction. The total integrated fiducial cross-section is measured to be $215

energy conversion efficiency and high optical power threshold, especially when
the repetition rate is within the microwave range that is convenient for direct
detection with off-the-shelf electronics. Efficient DKS can be generated by
spatiotemporally structured light (i.e., pulsed pumping), which to date however
has required complex cascaded modulators for pulse synthesis. Here we
demonstrate a photonic integrated approach to pulsed pumping. By actively

crystalline and integrated microresonators with coherent picosecond laser

required average pumping power by one order of magnitude to a record-setting
level of a few milliwatts. In addition, we unveil the critical role of the
phase profile of the pumping pulses, and for the first time implement phase
engineering on the pulsed pumping scheme by either accessing a multimode lasing
regime in the gain-switching mode or applying external chirping to support
robust single-soliton generation. Our work leverages the advantages of gain

analysis targets two types of signal models: gluino-mediated pair production of
stops with a nearly mass-degenerate stop and neutralino; and direct pair
production of stops, decaying to the top quark and the lightest neutralino. The
experimental signature in both signal scenarios is similar to that of a top
quark pair produced in association with large missing transverse momentum. No

and exclusion limits on gluino and stop masses are set at 95% confidence level.
The results extend the LHC Run-1 exclusion limit on the gluino mass up to 1460
GeV in the gluino-mediated scenario in the high gluino and low stop mass

performance electronic devices. In two-dimensional (2D) semiconductor devices,
minimizing the voltage drop at this junction is particularly challenging and
important. Despite numerous studies concerning contact resistance in 2D
semiconductors, the exact nature of the buried interface under a
three-dimensional (3D) metal remains unclear. Herein, we report the direct
measurement of electrical and optical responses of 2D semiconductor-metal
buried interfaces using a recently developed metal-assisted transfer technique

scanning probe techniques. We characterize the spatially varying electronic and
optical properties of this buried interface with < 20 nm resolution. To be
specific, potential, conductance and photoluminescence at the buried
metal/MoS$_2$ interface are correlated as a function of a variety of metal
deposition conditions as well as the type of metal contacts. We observe that
direct evaporation of Au on MoS$_2$ induces a large strain of ~5% in the
MoS$_2$ which, coupled with charge transfer, leads to degenerate doping of the
MoS$_2$ underneath the contact. These factors lead to improvement of contact
resistance to record values of 138 kohm-um, as measured using local conductance
probes. This approach was adopted to characterize MoS$_2$-In/Au alloy

ICMEs, geomagnetic storms, low-latitude aurorae, and cosmic-ray (CR)

decrease in CR and 72 nT in SSC) and the ICME associated with the storms that
followed as more moderate (~ 3% decrease in CR and 63 nT in SSC; ~ 2% decrease

interferometric observations of PSR B1259-63 over 4.4 years, fully sampling the

the sky. Taking our findings together with previous results from pulsar timing
observations, all seven orbital elements for the system are now fully

operating on a 600 km equatorial orbit since May 1996. We present here the
in-flight performances of the Gamma Ray Burst Monitor experiment during its
first year of operation. The GRBM is the secondary function of the four CsI(Na)
slabs primarily operating as an active anticoincidence of the PDS hard X-ray
experiment.. It has a geometric area of about 4000 cm2 but, due to its location
in the core of the satellite its effective area is dependent on the energy and
direction of the impinging photons. A dedicated electronics allows to trigger
on cosmic gamma-ray bursts. When the trigger condition is satisfied the light
curve of the event is recorded from 8 s before to 98 s after the trigger time,
with a maximum time resolution of 0.48 ms, in an energy band of 40-700 keV.",astro-ph/9708168v1,astro-ph,1997-08-19 10:44:11+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('M. Feroci'), arxiv.Result.Author('F.

411,"Electronic, mechanical, and thermodynamic properties of americium dioxide","By performing density functional theory (DFT) +$U$ calculations, we
systematically study the electronic, mechanical, tensile, and thermodynamic
properties of AmO$_{2}$. The experimentally observed antiferromagnetic
insulating feature [J. Chem. Phys. 63, 3174 (1975)] is successfully reproduced.
It is found that the chemical bonding character in AmO$_{2}$ is similar to that
in PuO$_{2}$, with smaller charge transfer and stronger covalent interactions
between americium and oxygen atoms. The valence band maximum and conduction
band minimum are contributed by 2$p-5f$ hybridized and 5$f$ electronic states
respectively. The elastic constants and various moduli are calculated, which
show that AmO$_{2}$ is less stable against shear forces than PuO$_{2}$. The
stress-strain relationship of AmO$_{2}$ is examined along the three low-index
directions by employing the first-principles computational tensile test method.
It is found that similar to PuO$_{2}$, the [100] and [111] directions are the
strongest and weakest tensile directions, respectively, but the theoretical
tensile strengths of AmO$_{2}$ are smaller than those of PuO$_{2}$. The phonon
dispersion curves of AmO$_{2}$ are calculated and the heat capacities as well
as lattice expansion curve are subsequently determined. The lattice thermal
conductance of AmO$_{2}$ is further evaluated and compared with attainable
experiments. Our present work integrally reveals various physical properties of
AmO$_{2}$ and can be referenced for technological applications of AmO$_{2}$

412,Event driven 4D STEM acquisition with a Timepix3 detector: microsecond dwell time and faster scans for high precision and low dose applications,"Four dimensional scanning transmission electron microscopy (4D STEM) records
the scattering of electrons in a material in great detail. The benefits offered
by 4D STEM are substantial, with the wealth of data it provides facilitating
for instance high precision, high electron dose efficiency phase imaging via
center of mass or ptychography based analysis. However the requirement for a 2D
image of the scattering to be recorded at each probe position has long placed a
severe bottleneck on the speed at which 4D STEM can be performed. Recent
advances in camera technology have greatly reduced this bottleneck, with the
detection efficiency of direct electron detectors being especially well suited
to the technique. However even the fastest frame driven pixelated detectors
still significantly limit the scan speed which can be used in 4D STEM, making
the resulting data susceptible to drift and hampering its use for low dose beam
sensitive applications. Here we report the development of the use of an event
driven Timepix3 direct electron camera that allows us to overcome this
bottleneck and achieve 4D STEM dwell times down to 100~ns; orders of magnitude
faster than what has been possible with frame based readout. We characterise
the detector for different acceleration voltages and show that the method is
especially well suited for low dose imaging and promises rich datasets without
compromising dwell time when compared to conventional STEM imaging.",2107.02864v3,physics.ins-det,2021-07-06 19:56:38+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Daen Jannis'), arxiv.Result.Author('Christoph Hofer'), arxiv.Result.Author('Chuang Gao'), arxiv.Result.Author('Xiaobin Xie'), arxiv.Result.Author('Armand Béché'), arxiv.Result.Author('Timothy J.

with replica surface-relief gratings including an echelle-type grism, and eight
grisms with volume-phase holographic (VPH) gratings. The size of these grisms
is 110 mm X 106 mm in aperture with a maximum thickness of 110 mm. We employ
not only the dichromated gelatin, but also the hologram resin as a recording
material for VPH gratings. We discuss the performance of these FOCAS grisms

MeerKAT has begun its science operations. To make full use of the widefield
capability of the array, it is imperative that we have an accurate model of the
primary beam of its antennas. We have taken available L-band full-polarization
'astro-holographic' observations of three antennas and a generic
electromagnetic simulation and created sparse representations of the beams
using principal components and Zernike polynomials. The spectral behaviour of
the spatial coefficients has been modelled using discrete cosine transform. We
have provided the Zernike-based model over a diameter of 10 deg averaged over
the beams of three antennas in an associated software tool (EIDOS) that can be
useful in direction-dependent calibration and imaging. The model is more
accurate for the diagonal elements of the beam Jones matrix and at lower
frequencies. As we get more accurate beam measurements and simulations in the
future, especially for the cross-polarization patterns, our pipeline can be
used to create more accurate sparse representations of MeerKAT beams.",1904.07155v2,astro-ph.IM,2019-04-15 16:10:52+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('K. M. B. Asad'), arxiv.Result.Author('J. N.

416,First Measurement of the Absolute Branching Fraction of $Λ\to p μ^- \barν_μ$,"The absolute branching fraction of $\Lambda \to p \mu^- \bar{\nu}_{\mu}$ is
reported for the first time based on an $e^+e^-$ annihilation sample of ten
billion $J/\psi$ events collected with the BESIII detector at $\sqrt{s}=3.097$
GeV. The branching fraction is determined to be ${\mathcal B}(\Lambda \to
p\mu^- \bar{\nu}_{\mu}) = [1.48\pm0.21(\rm stat) \pm 0.08(\rm syst)]\times
10^{-4}$, which is a significant improvement in precision over the previous
indirect measurements. Combining this result with the world average of
${\mathcal B}(\Lambda \to p e^- \bar{\nu}_{e})$, we obtain the ratio,
$\frac{\Gamma(\Lambda \to p \mu^- \bar{\nu}_{\mu})}{\Gamma(\Lambda \to p e^-
\bar{\nu}_{e})}$, to be $0.178 \pm 0.028$, which agrees with the standard model
prediction assuming lepton flavor universality. The asymmetry of the branching
fractions of $\Lambda \to p \mu^- \bar{\nu}_{\mu}$ and $\bar{\Lambda} \to

two learners with competing objectives: a trusted verifier network tries to

attempts to persuade the verifier of a particular answer, regardless of its
correctness. The goal is for a reliable justification protocol to emerge from
this game. We analyze variants of the framework, including simultaneous and
sequential games, and narrow the space down to a subset of games which provably
have the desired equilibria. We develop instantiations of the PVG for two
algorithmic tasks, and show that in practice, the verifier learns a robust
decision rule that is able to receive useful and reliable information from an
untrusted prover. Importantly, the protocol still works even when the verifier

policy lookup tables in systems such as the Airborne Collision Avoidance System
(ACAS). It is vital to ensure the safety of such neural controllers via
verification techniques. The problem of analyzing ACAS Xu networks has
motivated many successful neural network verifiers. These verifiers typically
analyze the internal computation of neural networks to decide whether a
property regarding the input/output holds. The intrinsic complexity of neural
network computation renders such verifiers slow to run and vulnerable to
floating-point error.
  This paper revisits the original problem of verifying ACAS Xu networks. The
networks take low-dimensional sensory inputs with training data provided by a
precomputed lookup table. We propose to prepend an input quantization layer to
the network. Quantization allows efficient verification via input state
enumeration, whose complexity is bounded by the size of the quantization space.
Quantization is equivalent to nearest-neighbor interpolation at run time, which
has been shown to provide acceptable accuracy for ACAS in simulation. Moreover,
our technique can deliver exact verification results immune to floating-point
error if we directly enumerate the network outputs on the target inference
implementation or on an accurate simulation of the target implementation.",2108.07961v1,cs.LG,2021-08-18 03:42:05+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Kai Jia'), arxiv.Result.Author('Martin Rinard')]",

constraints into a simple first-order imperative program that is safe iff the
constraints are satisfiable. Thus, in one swoop, HMC makes tools for invariant

Based on these algorithms, procedures for verifying linear information

procedures can produce analytical proofs that are both human-verifiable and
free of numerical errors. Our procedures are also more efficient
computationally. For constrained inequalities, by taking advantage of the

to verify directly if the solar wind elemental fractionation is reflective of
the coronal source region fractionation, both within and across different solar
wind source regions. A backmapping scheme was used to predict where solar wind
measured by the Advanced Composition Explorer (ACE) originated in the corona.
The coronal composition measured by the Hinode Extreme ultraviolet Imaging
Spectrometer (EIS) at the source regions was then compared with the in-situ
solar wind composition. On hourly timescales there was no apparent correlation
between coronal and solar wind composition. In contrast, the distribution of
fractionation values within individual source regions was similar in both the
corona and solar wind, but distributions between different sources have
significant overlap. The matching distributions directly verifies that
elemental composition is conserved as the plasma travels from the corona to the
solar wind, further validating it as a tracer of heating and acceleration
processes. The overlap of fractionation values between sources means it is not
possible to identify solar wind source regions solely by comparing solar wind

be impacted by the rise in the use of artificial intelligence, and especially
machine learning methods. We argue that fairness for people with disabilities
is different to fairness for other protected attributes such as age, gender or
race. One major difference is the extreme diversity of ways disabilities
manifest, and people adapt. Secondly, disability information is highly
sensitive and not always shared, precisely because of the potential for
discrimination. Given these differences, we explore definitions of fairness and
how well they work in the disability space. Finally, we suggest ways of
approaching fairness for people with disabilities in AI applications.",1811.10670v1,cs.AI,2018-11-26 20:11:30+00:00,[arxiv.Result.Author('Shari Trewin')],
443,"Polarization, Abstention, and the Median Voter Theorem","The median voter theorem has long been the default model of voter behavior
and candidate choice. While contemporary work on the distribution of political
opinion has emphasized polarization and an increasing gap between the ""left""
and the ""right"" in democracies, the median voter theorem presents a model of
anti-polarization: competing candidates move to the center of the ideological
distribution to maximize vote share, regardless of the underlying ideological
distribution of voters. These anti-polar results, however, largely depend on
the ""singled-peakedness"" of voter preferences, an assumption that is rapidly
loosing relevance in the age of polarization. This article presents a model of
voter choice that examines three potential mechanisms that can undermine this
finding: a relative cost of voting that deters voters who are sufficiently
indifferent to both candidates, ideologically motivated third-party
alternatives that attract extreme voters, and a bimodal distribution of voter
ideology. Under reasonable sets of conditions and empirically observed voter
opinion distributions, these mechanisms can be sufficient to cause
strategically-minded candidates to fail to converge to the center, or to even
become more polarized than their electorate.",2103.12847v1,physics.soc-ph,2021-03-23 21:14:22+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Matthew I. Jones'), arxiv.Result.Author('Antonio D. Sirianni'), arxiv.Result.Author('Feng Fu')]",
444,A Fault Tolerance Improved Majority Voter for TMR System Architectures,"For digital system designs, triple modular redundancy (TMR), which is a
3-tuple version of N-modular redundancy is widely preferred for many
mission-control and safety-critical applications. The TMR scheme involves
two-times duplication of the simplex system hardware, with a majority voter
ensuring correctness provided at least two out of three copies of the system
remain operational. Thus the majority voter plays a pivotal role in ensuring
the correct operation of the system. The fundamental assumption implicit in the
TMR scheme is that the majority voter does not become faulty, which may not
hold well for implementations based on latest technology nodes with dimensions
of the order of just tens of nanometers. To overcome the drawbacks of the
classical majority voter some new voter designs were put forward in the
literature with the aim of enhancing the fault tolerance. However, these voter
designs generally ensure the correct system operation in the presence of either
a faulty function module or the faulty voter, considered only in isolation.
Since multiple faults may no longer be excluded in the nanoelectronics regime,
simultaneous fault occurrences on both the function module and the voter should
be considered, and the fault tolerance of the voters have to be analyzed under
such a scenario. In this context, this article proposes a new fault-tolerant
majority voter which is found to be more robust to faults than the existing
voters in the presence of faults occurring internally and/or externally to the
voter. Moreover, the proposed voter features less power dissipation, delay, and
area metrics based on the simulation results obtained by using a 32/28nm CMOS
process.",1605.03771v2,cs.AR,2016-05-12 11:54:44+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('P Balasubramanian'), arxiv.Result.Author('K Prasad')]","WSEAS Transactions on Circuits and Systems, vol. 15, Article #14,

445,On the Computational Complexity of Variants of Combinatorial Voter Control in Elections,"Voter control problems model situations in which an external agent tries
toaffect the result of an election by adding or deleting the fewest number of
voters. The goal of the agent is to make a specific candidate either win
(\emph{constructive} control) or lose (\emph{destructive} control) the
election. We study the constructive and destructive voter control problems
whenadding and deleting voters have a \emph{combinatorial flavor}: If we add
(resp.\ delete) a voter~$v$, we also add (resp.\ delete) a bundle~$\kappa(v) $
of voters that are associated with~$v$. While the bundle~$\kappa(v)$ may have
more than one voter, a voter may also be associated with more than one voter.
We analyze the computational complexity of the four voter control problems for
the Plurality rule. We obtain that, in general, making a candidate lose is
computationally easier than making her win. In particular, if the bundling
relation is symmetric (i.e.\ $\forall w\colon w \in \kappa(v) \Leftrightarrow v
\in \kappa(w) $), and if each voter has at most two voters associated with him,
then destructive control is polynomial-time solvable while the constructive
variant remains $\NP$-hard. Even if the bundles are disjoint (i.e.\ $\forall
w\colon w \in \kappa(v) \Leftrightarrow \kappa(v) = \kappa(w) $), the
constructive problem variants remain intractable. Finally, the minimization
variant of constructive control by adding voters does not admit an efficient
approximation algorithm, unless P=NP.",1701.05108v1,cs.MA,2017-01-18 15:36:46+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Leon Kellerhals'), arxiv.Result.Author('Viatcheslav Korenwein'), arxiv.Result.Author('Philipp Zschoche'), arxiv.Result.Author('Robert Bredereck'), arxiv.Result.Author('Jiehua Chen')]",

deficit requiring change to the disabled individual. However, models have
emerged from disability activists and disabled intellectuals that emphasize the
role of disabling social structures in preventing or hindering equal access
across the ability continuum. We used the social relational proposition, which
situates disability within the interaction of impairments and particular social
structures, to identify disabling structures in introductory STEM courses. We
conducted interviews with nine students who identified with a range of
impairments about their experiences in introductory STEM courses. We assembled
a diverse research team and analyzed the interviews through phenomenological
analysis. Participants reported course barriers that prevented effective
engagement with course content. These barriers resulted in challenges with time
management as well as feelings of stress and anxiety. We discuss

congressional elections. This is achieved by predicting an individual voter's
likelihood to vote and an individual voter's likelihood to vote for a given
party, if he votes. We make a rough prediction of these values. We then update
these predictions by incorporating information on a municipality wide basis via
aggregate data to enhance our estimate under the assumption that nearby voters
have similar behavior, which could be due to social interaction or common
external factors. Finally, we use a ranking scheme on these predictions to
identify two key types of voter: 1) Voters who are likely to vote that we can
convince to vote for a given party; and, 2) Voters who are likely to vote for a
given party, if they vote, that we can convince to actually turn out to vote.
Once these voters have been identified, a political campaign can use this
information to micro-target voters and win more votes.",1405.5111v1,physics.soc-ph,2014-05-19 06:30:42+00:00,[arxiv.Result.Author('Steven Ambadjes')],

450,TRIP: Trustless Coercion-Resistant In-Person Voter Registration,"Most existing remote electronic voting systems are vulnerable to voter
coercion and vote buying. While coercion-resistant voting systems address this
challenge, current schemes assume that the voter has access to an untappable,
incorruptible device during voter registration. We present TRIP, an in-person
voter registration scheme enabling voters to create verifiable and
indistinguishable real and fake credentials using an untrusted kiosk inside a
privacy booth at a supervised location, e.g., the registrar's office. TRIP
ensures the integrity of the voter's real credential while enabling the
creation of fake credentials using interactive zero-knowledge proofs between
the voter as the verifier and the kiosk as the prover, unbeknownst to the
average voter. TRIP ensures that even voters who are under extreme coercion,
and cannot leave the booth with a real credential, can delegate their vote to a
political party, with the caveat that they must then trust the kiosk. TRIP
optimizes the tallying process by limiting the number of credentials a voter
can receive and capping the number of votes that a credential can cast per
election. We conduct a preliminary usability study among 41 participants at a
university and found that 42.5% of participants rated TRIP a B or higher in
usability, a promising result for a voter registration scheme that
substantially reduces trust in the registrar.",2202.06692v1,cs.CR,2022-02-14 13:35:46+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Louis-Henri Merino'), arxiv.Result.Author('Simone Colombo'), arxiv.Result.Author('Jeff Allen'), arxiv.Result.Author('Vero Estrada-Galiñanes'), arxiv.Result.Author('Bryan Ford')]",

groups (every voter group is a set of votes) and two integers $k_a$ and $k_d$
corresponding to respectively the number of voter groups the attacker can
attack and the number of voter groups the defender can defend. A voter group
gets removed from the election if it is attacked but not defended. In the
optimal defense problem, we want to know if it is possible for the defender to
commit to a strategy of defending at most $k_d$ voter groups such that, no
matter which $k_a$ voter groups the attacker attacks, the outcome of the
election does not change. In the optimal attack problem, we want to know if it

groups such that, no matter which $k_d$ voter groups the defender defends, the
outcome of the election is always different from the original (without any
attack) one.",1905.11838v1,cs.MA,2019-05-28 14:20:33+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Palash Dey'), arxiv.Result.Author('Neeldhara Misra'), arxiv.Result.Author('Swaprava Nath'), arxiv.Result.Author('Garima Shakya')]",
456,Wisdom of the Crowd Voting: Truthful Aggregation of Voter Information and Preferences,"We consider two-alternative elections where voters' preferences depend on a
state variable that is not directly observable. Each voter receives a private
signal that is correlated to the state variable. Voters may be ""contingent""
with different preferences in different states; or predetermined with the same
preference in every state. In this setting, even if every voter is a contingent
voter, agents voting according to their private information need not result in
the adoption of the universally preferred alternative, because the signals can
be systematically biased.
  We present an easy-to-deploy mechanism that elicits and aggregates the
private signals from the voters, and outputs the alternative that is favored by
the majority. In particular, voters truthfully reporting their signals forms a
strong Bayes Nash equilibrium (where no coalition of voters can deviate and
receive a better outcome).",2108.03749v1,cs.GT,2021-08-08 22:20:15+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Grant Schoenebeck'), arxiv.Result.Author('Biaoshuai Tao')]","Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems 2021, Vol. 34,

457,k-Majority Digraphs and the Hardness of Voting with a Constant Number of Voters,"Many hardness results in computational social choice make use of the fact
that every directed graph may be induced as the pairwise majority relation of
some preference profile. However, this fact requires a number of voters that is
almost linear in the number of alternatives. It is therefore unclear whether
these results remain intact when the number of voters is bounded, as is, for
example, typically the case in search engine aggregation settings. In this
paper, we provide a systematic study of majority digraphs for a constant number
of voters resulting in analytical, experimental, and complexity-theoretic
insights. First, we characterize the set of digraphs that can be induced by two
and three voters, respectively, and give sufficient conditions for larger
numbers of voters. Second, we present a surprisingly efficient implementation
via SAT solving for computing the minimal number of voters that is required to
induce a given digraph and experimentally evaluate how many voters are required
to induce the majority digraphs of real-world and generated preference
profiles. Finally, we leverage our sufficient conditions to show that the
winner determination problem of various well-known voting rules remains hard
even when there is only a small constant number of voters. In particular, we
show that Kemeny's rule is hard to evaluate for 7 voters, while previous
methods could only establish such a result for constant even numbers of voters.",1704.06304v1,cs.GT,2017-04-20 19:04:28+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Georg Bachmeier'), arxiv.Result.Author('Felix Brandt'), arxiv.Result.Author('Christian Geist'), arxiv.Result.Author('Paul Harrenstein'), arxiv.Result.Author('Keyvan Kardel'), arxiv.Result.Author('Dominik Peters'), arxiv.Result.Author('Hans Georg Seedig')]",
458,Reputation-Driven Voting Dynamics,"We introduce the reputational voter model (RVM) to account for the
time-varying abilities of individuals to influence their neighbors. To
understand of the RVM, we first discuss the fitness voter model (FVM), in which
each voter has a fixed and distinct fitness. In a voting event where voter $i$
is fitter than voter $j$, only $j$ changes opinion. We show that the dynamics
of the FVM and the voter model are identical. We next discuss the adaptive
voter model (AVM), in which the influencing voter in a voting event increases
its fitness by a fixed amount. The dynamics of the AVM is non-stationary and
slowly crosses over to that of FVM because of the gradual broadening of the
fitness distribution of the population. Finally, we treat the RVM, in which the
voter $i$ is endowed with a reputational rank $r_i$ that ranges from 1 (highest
rank) to $N$ (lowest), where $N$ is the population size. In a voting event in
which voter $i$ outranks $j$, only the opinion of $j$ changes. Concomitantly,
the rank of $i$ increases, while that of $j$ does not change. The rank
distribution remains uniform on the integers $1,2,3,\ldots,N$, leading to
stationary dynamics. For equal number of voters in the two voting states with
these two subpopulations having the same average rand, the time to reach
consensus in the mean-field limit scales as $\exp(\sqrt{N})$. This long
consensus time arises because the average rank of the minority population is
typically higher than that of the majority. Thus whenever consensus is
approached, this highly ranked minority tends to drive the population away from
consensus.",1902.09371v2,physics.soc-ph,2019-02-22 18:19:16+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('D. Bhat'), arxiv.Result.Author('S. Redner')]",J. Stat. Mech. (2019) 063208

460,An Axiomatic Characterization of Split Cycle,"A number of rules for resolving majority cycles in elections have been
proposed in the literature. Recently, Holliday and Pacuit (Journal of
Theoretical Politics 33 (2021) 475-524) axiomatically characterized one such
cycle-resolving rule, dubbed Split Cycle: in each majority cycle, discard the
majority preferences with the smallest majority margin. They showed that any
rule satisfying five standard axioms, plus a weakening of Arrow's Independence
of Irrelevant Alternatives (IIA) called Coherent IIA, is refined by Split
Cycle. In this paper, we go further and show that Split Cycle is the only rule
satisfying the axioms of Holliday and Pacuit together with two additional
axioms: Coherent Defeat and Positive Involvement in Defeat. Coherent Defeat
states that any majority preference not occurring in a cycle is retained, while
Positive Involvement in Defeat is closely related to the well-known axiom of
Positive Involvement (as in J. P\'{e}rez, Social Choice and Welfare 18 (2001)
601-616). We characterize Split Cycle not only as a collective choice rule but
also as a social choice correspondence, over both profiles of linear ballots

461,Limiting Risk by Turning Manifest Phantoms into Evil Zombies,"Drawing a random sample of ballots to conduct a risk-limiting audit generally
requires knowing how the ballots cast in an election are organized into groups,
for instance, how many containers of ballots there are in all and how many
ballots are in each container. A list of the ballot group identifiers along
with number of ballots in each group is called a ballot manifest. What if the
ballot manifest is not accurate? Surprisingly, even if ballots are known to be
missing from the manifest, it is not necessary to make worst-case assumptions
about those ballots--for instance, to adjust the margin by the number of
missing ballots--to ensure that the audit remains conservative. Rather, it
suffices to make worst-case assumptions about the individual randomly selected
ballots that the audit cannot find. This observation provides a simple
modification to some risk-limiting audit procedures that makes them
automatically become more conservative if the ballot manifest has errors. The
modification--phantoms to evil zombies (~2EZ)--requires only an upper bound on
the total number of ballots cast. ~2EZ makes the audit P-value stochastically
larger than it would be had the manifest been accurate, automatically requiring
more than enough ballots to be audited to offset the manifest errors. This
ensures that the true risk limit remains smaller than the nominal risk limit.
On the other hand, if the manifest is in fact accurate and the upper bound on
the total number of ballots equals the total according to the manifest, ~2EZ
has no effect at all on the number of ballots audited nor on the true risk
limit.",1207.3413v1,stat.AP,2012-07-14 11:26:02+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Jorge H. Banuelos'), arxiv.Result.Author('Philip B. Stark')]",

In this study, we altered votes on a voter's ballot after they had made their
selections on a BMD. We then required them to examine their ballots for any
changes from the slate they used to vote. Overall accuracy was exceptionally
high. Participants saw 1440 total contests, and of those 1440, there were a
total of 4 errors, so total accuracy was 99.8%. Participants were able to
perform with near-perfect accuracy regardless of ballot length, ballot type,
number of altered races, and location of altered races. Detection performance
was extremely robust. We conclude that with proper direction and resources,
voters can be near-perfect detectors of ballot changes on printed paper ballots

Menu"" consisting of several prices. In equilibrium, the adversary can buy the
real ballots of any strict subset of districts at a price corresponding to the
willingness to sell on the part of the citizens holding such ballots. By
contrast, decoy voters are trapped into selling their ballots at a low, or even
negligible, price. Blowing up the adversary's budget by introducing decoy
ballots may thus turn out to be futile. The Devil's Menu can also be applied to

466,The ATHENA Class of Risk-Limiting Ballot Polling Audits,"The main risk-limiting ballot polling audit in use today, BRAVO, is designed
for use when single ballots are drawn at random and a decision regarding
whether to stop the audit or draw another ballot is taken after each ballot
draw (ballot-by-ballot (B2) audits). On the other hand, real ballot polling
audits draw many ballots in a single round before determining whether to stop
(round-by-round (R2) audits). We show that BRAVO results in significant
inefficiency when directly applied to real R2 audits. We present the ATHENA
class of R2 stopping rules, which we show are risk-limiting if the round
schedule is pre-determined (before the audit begins). We prove that each rule
is at least as efficient as the corresponding BRAVO stopping rule applied at
the end of the round. We have open-source software libraries implementing most
of our results.
  We show that ATHENA halves the number of ballots required, for all state
margins in the 2016 US Presidential election and a first round with $90\%$
stopping probability, when compared to BRAVO (stopping rule applied at the end
of the round). We present simulation results supporting the 90% stopping
probability claims and our claims for the risk accrued in the first round.
Further, ATHENA reduces the number of ballots by more than a quarter for low
margins, when compared to the BRAVO stopping rule applied on ballots in
selection order. This implies that keeping track of the order when drawing
ballots R2 is not beneficial, because ATHENA is more efficient even without
information on selection order. These results are significant because current
approaches to real ballot polling election audits use the B2 BRAVO rules,
requiring about twice as much work on the part of election officials. Applying
the rules in selection order requires fewer ballots, but keeping track of the
order, and entering it into audit software, adds to the effort.",2008.02315v5,cs.CR,2020-08-05 18:47:37+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Filip Zagórski'), arxiv.Result.Author('Grant McClearn'), arxiv.Result.Author('Sarah Morin'), arxiv.Result.Author('Neal McBurnett'), arxiv.Result.Author('Poorvi L.

467,A non-biased trust model for wireless mesh networks,"Trust models that rely on recommendation trusts are vulnerable to badmouthing
and ballot-stuffing attacks. To cope with these attacks, existing trust models
use different trust aggregation techniques to process the recommendation trusts
and combine them with the direct trust values to form a combined trust value.
However, these trust models are biased as recommendation trusts that deviate
too much from one's own opinion are discarded. In this paper, we propose a
non-biased trust model that considers every recommendation trusts available
regardless they are good or bad. Our trust model is based on a combination of 2
techniques: the dissimilarity test and the Dempster-Shafer Theory. The
dissimilarity test determines the amount of conflict between 2 trust records,
whereas the Dempster-Shafer Theory assigns belief functions based on the
results of the dissimilarity test. Numerical results show that our trust model
is robust against reputation-based attacks when compared to trust aggregation
techniques such as the linear opinion pooling, subjective logic model,
entropy-based probability model, and regression analysis. In addition, our

not require identification numbers on the ballots or counting many ballots per

justifiably high confidence that the reported results of an election are
consistent with an audit trail (""ballots""), which can be paper or electronic.
SOBA combines three ideas: (1) publishing cast vote records (CVRs) separately
for each contest, so that anyone can verify that each reported contest outcome
is correct, if the CVRs reflect voters' intentions with sufficient accuracy;
(2) shrouding a mapping between ballots and the CVRs for those ballots to
prevent the loss of privacy that could occur otherwise; (3) assessing the
accuracy with which the CVRs reflect voters' intentions for a collection of
contests while simultaneously assessing the integrity of the shrouded mapping
between ballots and CVRs by comparing randomly selected ballots to the CVRs
that purport to represent them. Step (1) is related to work by the Humboldt
County Election Transparency Project, but publishing CVRs separately for
individual contests rather than images of entire ballots preserves privacy.
Step (2) requires a cryptographic commitment from elections officials.
Observers participate in step (3), which relies on the ""super-simple
simultaneous single-ballot risk-limiting audit."" Step (3) is designed to reveal
relatively few ballots if the shrouded mapping is proper and the CVRs
accurately reflect voter intent. But if the reported outcomes of the contests

simply choose not to attempt verification in the first place. In order to
understand this problem, we conducted an experiment in which 108 participants
participated in a mock election where the BMD displayed the voters' true

design of the printed ballot, the length of the ballot, the number of changes

instructions provided to the voters were manipulated as part of the experiment.
Results indicated that of those voters who chose to examine the printed ballot,

influence the outcome of an election, given fixed voter preferences. We show
that there exist preference profiles over $k$ candidates such that up to $k-1$
different candidates win at different ballot lengths. We derive exact lower
bounds on the number of voters required for such profiles and provide a
construction matching the lower bound for unrestricted voter preferences.
Additionally, we characterize which sequences of winners are possible over
ballot lengths and provide explicit profile constructions achieving any
feasible winner sequence. We also examine how classic preference restrictions
influence our results--for instance, single-peakedness makes $k-1$ different
winners impossible but still allows at least $\Omega(\sqrt k)$. Finally, we
analyze a collection of 168 real-world elections, where we truncate rankings to
simulate shorter ballots. We find that shorter ballots could have changed the

surrounding AI have attracted increasing attention. In particular, autonomous
vehicles may face moral dilemmas in accident scenarios, such as staying the
course resulting in hurting pedestrians or swerving leading to hurting
passengers. To investigate such ethical dilemmas, recent studies have adopted
preference aggregation, in which each voter expresses her/his preferences over
decisions for the possible ethical dilemma scenarios, and a centralized system
aggregates these preferences to obtain the winning decision. Although a useful
methodology for building ethical AI systems, such an approach can potentially
violate the privacy of voters since moral preferences are sensitive information
and their disclosure can be exploited by malicious parties. In this paper, we
report a first-of-its-kind privacy-preserving crowd-guided AI decision-making

quantify privacy and consider four granularities of privacy protection by
taking voter-/record-level privacy protection and centralized/distributed
perturbation into account, resulting in four approaches VLCP, RLCP, VLDP, and
RLDP. Moreover, we propose different algorithms to achieve these privacy
protection granularities, while retaining the accuracy of the learned moral
preference model. Specifically, VLCP and RLCP are implemented with the data
aggregator setting a universal privacy parameter and perturbing the averaged
moral preference to protect the privacy of voters' data. VLDP and RLDP are
implemented in such a way that each voter perturbs her/his local moral

attribute disclosure concurrently in the risk measure, and they make
restrictive assumptions on an adversary's knowledge by assuming certain
attributes are quasi-identifiers and there is a clear boundary between
quasi-identifiers and sensitive information. In this paper, we present a novel
disclosure risk measure that addresses these limitations, by presenting a

toaffect the result of an election by adding or deleting the fewest number of
voters. The goal of the agent is to make a specific candidate either win
(\emph{constructive} control) or lose (\emph{destructive} control) the
election. We study the constructive and destructive voter control problems
whenadding and deleting voters have a \emph{combinatorial flavor}: If we add
(resp.\ delete) a voter~$v$, we also add (resp.\ delete) a bundle~$\kappa(v) $
of voters that are associated with~$v$. While the bundle~$\kappa(v)$ may have
more than one voter, a voter may also be associated with more than one voter.
We analyze the computational complexity of the four voter control problems for
the Plurality rule. We obtain that, in general, making a candidate lose is
computationally easier than making her win. In particular, if the bundling
relation is symmetric (i.e.\ $\forall w\colon w \in \kappa(v) \Leftrightarrow v
\in \kappa(w) $), and if each voter has at most two voters associated with him,
then destructive control is polynomial-time solvable while the constructive
variant remains $\NP$-hard. Even if the bundles are disjoint (i.e.\ $\forall
w\colon w \in \kappa(v) \Leftrightarrow \kappa(v) = \kappa(w) $), the
constructive problem variants remain intractable. Finally, the minimization

3-tuple version of N-modular redundancy is widely preferred for many
mission-control and safety-critical applications. The TMR scheme involves
two-times duplication of the simplex system hardware, with a majority voter
ensuring correctness provided at least two out of three copies of the system
remain operational. Thus the majority voter plays a pivotal role in ensuring
the correct operation of the system. The fundamental assumption implicit in the
TMR scheme is that the majority voter does not become faulty, which may not
hold well for implementations based on latest technology nodes with dimensions
of the order of just tens of nanometers. To overcome the drawbacks of the
classical majority voter some new voter designs were put forward in the
literature with the aim of enhancing the fault tolerance. However, these voter
designs generally ensure the correct system operation in the presence of either
a faulty function module or the faulty voter, considered only in isolation.
Since multiple faults may no longer be excluded in the nanoelectronics regime,
simultaneous fault occurrences on both the function module and the voter should
be considered, and the fault tolerance of the voters have to be analyzed under
such a scenario. In this context, this article proposes a new fault-tolerant
majority voter which is found to be more robust to faults than the existing
voters in the presence of faults occurring internally and/or externally to the
voter. Moreover, the proposed voter features less power dissipation, delay, and
area metrics based on the simulation results obtained by using a 32/28nm CMOS
process.",1605.03771v2,cs.AR,2016-05-12 11:54:44+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('P Balasubramanian'), arxiv.Result.Author('K Prasad')]","WSEAS Transactions on Circuits and Systems, vol. 15, Article #14,

490,Influence of agent's self-disclosure on human empathy,"As AI technologies progress, social acceptance of AI agents, including
intelligent virtual agents and robots, is becoming even more important for more
applications of AI in human society. One way to improve the relationship
between humans and anthropomorphic agents is to have humans empathize with the
agents. By empathizing, humans act positively and kindly toward agents, which
makes it easier for them to accept the agents. In this study, we focus on
self-disclosure from agents to humans in order to increase empathy felt by
humans toward anthropomorphic agents. We experimentally investigate the
possibility that self-disclosure from an agent facilitates human empathy. We
formulate hypotheses and experimentally analyze and discuss the conditions in
which humans have more empathy toward agents. Experiments were conducted with a
three-way mixed plan, and the factors were the agents' appearance (human,
robot), self-disclosure (high-relevance self-disclosure, low-relevance
self-disclosure, no self-disclosure), and empathy before/after a video
stimulus. An analysis of variance (ANOVA) was performed using data from 918
participants. We found that the appearance factor did not have a main effect,
and self-disclosure that was highly relevant to the scenario used facilitated
more human empathy with a statistically significant difference. We also found
that no self-disclosure suppressed empathy.These results support our
hypotheses. This study reveals that self-disclosure represents an important
characteristic of anthropomorphic agents which helps humans to accept them.",2106.09906v2,cs.HC,2021-06-18 04:14:58+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Takahiro Tsumura'), arxiv.Result.Author('Seiji Yamada')]",
491,Endorsements on Social Media: An Empirical Study of Affiliate Marketing Disclosures on YouTube and Pinterest,"Online advertisements that masquerade as non-advertising content pose
numerous risks to users. Such hidden advertisements appear on social media

their content. While the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) requires content
creators to disclose their endorsements in order to prevent deception and harm

guidelines. In this paper, we studied disclosures within affiliate marketing,
an endorsement-based advertising strategy used by social media content
creators. We examined whether content creators follow the FTC's disclosure
guidelines, how they word the disclosures, and whether these disclosures help
users identify affiliate marketing content as advertisements. To do so, we
first measured the prevalence of and identified the types of disclosures in
over 500,000 YouTube videos and 2.1 million Pinterest pins. We then conducted a
user study with 1,791 participants to test the efficacy of these disclosures.
Our findings reveal that only about 10% of affiliate marketing content on both

these predictions by incorporating information on a municipality wide basis via
aggregate data to enhance our estimate under the assumption that nearby voters
have similar behavior, which could be due to social interaction or common
external factors. Finally, we use a ranking scheme on these predictions to
identify two key types of voter: 1) Voters who are likely to vote that we can
convince to vote for a given party; and, 2) Voters who are likely to vote for a
given party, if they vote, that we can convince to actually turn out to vote.
Once these voters have been identified, a political campaign can use this

coercion and vote buying. While coercion-resistant voting systems address this
challenge, current schemes assume that the voter has access to an untappable,
incorruptible device during voter registration. We present TRIP, an in-person
voter registration scheme enabling voters to create verifiable and
indistinguishable real and fake credentials using an untrusted kiosk inside a
privacy booth at a supervised location, e.g., the registrar's office. TRIP
ensures the integrity of the voter's real credential while enabling the
creation of fake credentials using interactive zero-knowledge proofs between
the voter as the verifier and the kiosk as the prover, unbeknownst to the
average voter. TRIP ensures that even voters who are under extreme coercion,
and cannot leave the booth with a real credential, can delegate their vote to a
political party, with the caveat that they must then trust the kiosk. TRIP
optimizes the tallying process by limiting the number of credentials a voter
can receive and capping the number of votes that a credential can cast per
election. We conduct a preliminary usability study among 41 participants at a
university and found that 42.5% of participants rated TRIP a B or higher in

state variable that is not directly observable. Each voter receives a private
signal that is correlated to the state variable. Voters may be ""contingent""
with different preferences in different states; or predetermined with the same
preference in every state. In this setting, even if every voter is a contingent
voter, agents voting according to their private information need not result in
the adoption of the universally preferred alternative, because the signals can
be systematically biased.
  We present an easy-to-deploy mechanism that elicits and aggregates the
private signals from the voters, and outputs the alternative that is favored by
the majority. In particular, voters truthfully reporting their signals forms a
strong Bayes Nash equilibrium (where no coalition of voters can deviate and
receive a better outcome).",2108.03749v1,cs.GT,2021-08-08 22:20:15+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Grant Schoenebeck'), arxiv.Result.Author('Biaoshuai Tao')]","Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems 2021, Vol. 34,

condition on its induced distribution over states and actions. We also
characterize how credibility restricts the Sender's ability to persuade under
different payoff structures. In particular, when the sender's payoff is
state-independent, all disclosure policies are credible. We apply our results
to the market for lemons, and show that no useful information can be credibly
disclosed by the seller, even though a seller who can commit to her disclosure
policy would perfectly reveal her private information to maximize profit.",2205.03495v1,econ.TH,2022-05-06 22:51:25+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Xiao Lin'), arxiv.Result.Author('Ce Liu')]",
497,k-Majority Digraphs and the Hardness of Voting with a Constant Number of Voters,"Many hardness results in computational social choice make use of the fact
that every directed graph may be induced as the pairwise majority relation of
some preference profile. However, this fact requires a number of voters that is
almost linear in the number of alternatives. It is therefore unclear whether
these results remain intact when the number of voters is bounded, as is, for
example, typically the case in search engine aggregation settings. In this
paper, we provide a systematic study of majority digraphs for a constant number
of voters resulting in analytical, experimental, and complexity-theoretic
insights. First, we characterize the set of digraphs that can be induced by two
and three voters, respectively, and give sufficient conditions for larger
numbers of voters. Second, we present a surprisingly efficient implementation
via SAT solving for computing the minimal number of voters that is required to
induce a given digraph and experimentally evaluate how many voters are required
to induce the majority digraphs of real-world and generated preference
profiles. Finally, we leverage our sufficient conditions to show that the
winner determination problem of various well-known voting rules remains hard
even when there is only a small constant number of voters. In particular, we
show that Kemeny's rule is hard to evaluate for 7 voters, while previous
methods could only establish such a result for constant even numbers of voters.",1704.06304v1,cs.GT,2017-04-20 19:04:28+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Georg Bachmeier'), arxiv.Result.Author('Felix Brandt'), arxiv.Result.Author('Christian Geist'), arxiv.Result.Author('Paul Harrenstein'), arxiv.Result.Author('Keyvan Kardel'), arxiv.Result.Author('Dominik Peters'), arxiv.Result.Author('Hans Georg Seedig')]",
498,Reputation-Driven Voting Dynamics,"We introduce the reputational voter model (RVM) to account for the
time-varying abilities of individuals to influence their neighbors. To
understand of the RVM, we first discuss the fitness voter model (FVM), in which
each voter has a fixed and distinct fitness. In a voting event where voter $i$
is fitter than voter $j$, only $j$ changes opinion. We show that the dynamics
of the FVM and the voter model are identical. We next discuss the adaptive
voter model (AVM), in which the influencing voter in a voting event increases
its fitness by a fixed amount. The dynamics of the AVM is non-stationary and
slowly crosses over to that of FVM because of the gradual broadening of the
fitness distribution of the population. Finally, we treat the RVM, in which the
voter $i$ is endowed with a reputational rank $r_i$ that ranges from 1 (highest
rank) to $N$ (lowest), where $N$ is the population size. In a voting event in
which voter $i$ outranks $j$, only the opinion of $j$ changes. Concomitantly,
the rank of $i$ increases, while that of $j$ does not change. The rank
distribution remains uniform on the integers $1,2,3,\ldots,N$, leading to
stationary dynamics. For equal number of voters in the two voting states with
these two subpopulations having the same average rand, the time to reach
consensus in the mean-field limit scales as $\exp(\sqrt{N})$. This long
consensus time arises because the average rank of the minority population is
typically higher than that of the majority. Thus whenever consensus is
approached, this highly ranked minority tends to drive the population away from
consensus.",1902.09371v2,physics.soc-ph,2019-02-22 18:19:16+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('D. Bhat'), arxiv.Result.Author('S. Redner')]",J. Stat. Mech. (2019) 063208
499,"Dialoging Resonance: How Users Perceive, Reciprocate and React to Chatbot's Self-Disclosure in Conversational Recommendations","Using chatbots to deliver recommendations is increasingly popular. The design
of recommendation chatbots has primarily been taking an information-centric
approach by focusing on the recommended content per se. Limited attention is on
how social connection and relational strategies, such as self-disclosure from a
chatbot, may influence users' perception and acceptance of the recommendation.
In this work, we designed, implemented, and evaluated a social chatbot capable
of performing three different levels of self-disclosure: factual information
(low), cognitive opinions (medium), and emotions (high). In the evaluation, we
recruited 372 participants to converse with the chatbot on two topics: movies
and COVID-19 experiences. In each topic, the chatbot performed small talks and
made recommendations relevant to the topic. Participants were randomly assigned
to four experimental conditions where the chatbot used factual, cognitive,
emotional, and adaptive strategies to perform self-disclosures. By training a
text classifier to identify users' level of self-disclosure in real-time, the
adaptive chatbot can dynamically match its self-disclosure to the level of
disclosure exhibited by the users. Our results show that users reciprocate with
higher-level self-disclosure when a recommendation chatbot consistently
displays emotions throughout the conversation. Chatbot's emotional disclosure
also led to increased interactional enjoyment and more positive interpersonal
perception towards the bot, fostering a stronger human-chatbot relationship and
thus leading to increased recommendation effectiveness, including a higher
tendency to accept the recommendation. We discuss the understandings obtained

500,Dispute Resolution in Voting,"In voting, disputes arise when a voter claims that the voting authority is
dishonest and did not correctly process his ballot while the authority claims
to have followed the protocol. A dispute can be resolved if any third party can
unambiguously determine who is right. We systematically characterize all
relevant disputes for a generic, practically relevant, class of voting
protocols. Based on our characterization, we propose a new definition of
dispute resolution for voting that accounts for the possibility that both
voters and the voting authority can make false claims and that voters may
abstain from voting.
  A central aspect of our work is timeliness: a voter should possess the
evidence required to resolve disputes no later than the election's end. We
characterize what assumptions are necessary and sufficient for timeliness in
terms of a communication topology for our voting protocol class. We formalize
the dispute resolution properties and communication topologies symbolically.
This provides the basis for verification of dispute resolution for a broad
class of protocols. To demonstrate the utility of our model, we analyze a
mixnet-based voting protocol and prove that it satisfies dispute resolution as
well as verifiability and receipt-freeness. To prove our claims, we combine
machine-checked proofs with traditional pen-and-paper proofs.",2005.03749v2,cs.CR,2020-05-07 20:51:24+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('David Basin'), arxiv.Result.Author('Sasa Radomirovic'), arxiv.Result.Author('Lara Schmid')]",

502,BVOT: Self-Tallying Boardroom Voting with Oblivious Transfer,"A boardroom election is an election with a small number of voters carried out
with public communications. We present BVOT, a self-tallying boardroom voting
protocol with ballot secrecy, fairness (no tally information is available
before the polls close), and dispute-freeness (voters can observe that all
voters correctly followed the protocol).
  BVOT works by using a multiparty threshold homomorphic encryption system in
which each candidate is associated with a masked unique prime. Each voter
engages in an oblivious transfer with an untrusted distributor: the voter
selects the index of a prime associated with a candidate and receives the
selected prime in masked form. The voter then casts their vote by encrypting
their masked prime and broadcasting it to everyone. The distributor does not
learn the voter's choice, and no one learns the mapping between primes and
candidates until the audit phase. By hiding the mapping between primes and
candidates, BVOT provides voters with insufficient information to carry out
effective cheating. The threshold feature prevents anyone from computing any
partial tally---until everyone has voted. Multiplying all votes, their
decryption shares, and the unmasking factor yields a product of the primes each
raised to the number of votes received.
  In contrast to some existing boardroom voting protocols, BVOT does not rely
on any zero-knowledge proof; instead, it uses oblivious transfer to assure
ballot secrecy and correct vote casting. Also, BVOT can handle multiple
candidates in one election. BVOT prevents cheating by hiding crucial
information: an attempt to increase the tally of one candidate might increase
the tally of another candidate. After all votes are cast, any party can tally
the votes.",2010.02421v1,cs.CR,2020-10-06 01:28:34+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Farid Javani'), arxiv.Result.Author('Alan T. Sherman')]",

themselves and without a weakest link, the protocol becomes more robust. We

centralized voting systems in decentralized IoT since the traditional ones are
not suitable for such scenarios. Unfortunately, self-tallying voting systems

506,Limiting Risk by Turning Manifest Phantoms into Evil Zombies,"Drawing a random sample of ballots to conduct a risk-limiting audit generally
requires knowing how the ballots cast in an election are organized into groups,
for instance, how many containers of ballots there are in all and how many
ballots are in each container. A list of the ballot group identifiers along
with number of ballots in each group is called a ballot manifest. What if the
ballot manifest is not accurate? Surprisingly, even if ballots are known to be
missing from the manifest, it is not necessary to make worst-case assumptions
about those ballots--for instance, to adjust the margin by the number of
missing ballots--to ensure that the audit remains conservative. Rather, it
suffices to make worst-case assumptions about the individual randomly selected
ballots that the audit cannot find. This observation provides a simple
modification to some risk-limiting audit procedures that makes them
automatically become more conservative if the ballot manifest has errors. The
modification--phantoms to evil zombies (~2EZ)--requires only an upper bound on
the total number of ballots cast. ~2EZ makes the audit P-value stochastically
larger than it would be had the manifest been accurate, automatically requiring
more than enough ballots to be audited to offset the manifest errors. This
ensures that the true risk limit remains smaller than the nominal risk limit.
On the other hand, if the manifest is in fact accurate and the upper bound on
the total number of ballots equals the total according to the manifest, ~2EZ
has no effect at all on the number of ballots audited nor on the true risk
limit.",1207.3413v1,stat.AP,2012-07-14 11:26:02+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Jorge H. Banuelos'), arxiv.Result.Author('Philip B. Stark')]",

willingness to sell on the part of the citizens holding such ballots. By
contrast, decoy voters are trapped into selling their ballots at a low, or even
negligible, price. Blowing up the adversary's budget by introducing decoy

Further, ATHENA reduces the number of ballots by more than a quarter for low
margins, when compared to the BRAVO stopping rule applied on ballots in
selection order. This implies that keeping track of the order when drawing
ballots R2 is not beneficial, because ATHENA is more efficient even without
information on selection order. These results are significant because current
approaches to real ballot polling election audits use the B2 BRAVO rules,
requiring about twice as much work on the part of election officials. Applying
the rules in selection order requires fewer ballots, but keeping track of the

Our method involves doing $k$ ""cuts"", each involving moving a random portion of

not require identification numbers on the ballots or counting many ballots per

520,Limiting Risk by Turning Manifest Phantoms into Evil Zombies,"Drawing a random sample of ballots to conduct a risk-limiting audit generally
requires knowing how the ballots cast in an election are organized into groups,
for instance, how many containers of ballots there are in all and how many
ballots are in each container. A list of the ballot group identifiers along
with number of ballots in each group is called a ballot manifest. What if the
ballot manifest is not accurate? Surprisingly, even if ballots are known to be
missing from the manifest, it is not necessary to make worst-case assumptions
about those ballots--for instance, to adjust the margin by the number of
missing ballots--to ensure that the audit remains conservative. Rather, it
suffices to make worst-case assumptions about the individual randomly selected
ballots that the audit cannot find. This observation provides a simple
modification to some risk-limiting audit procedures that makes them
automatically become more conservative if the ballot manifest has errors. The
modification--phantoms to evil zombies (~2EZ)--requires only an upper bound on
the total number of ballots cast. ~2EZ makes the audit P-value stochastically
larger than it would be had the manifest been accurate, automatically requiring
more than enough ballots to be audited to offset the manifest errors. This
ensures that the true risk limit remains smaller than the nominal risk limit.
On the other hand, if the manifest is in fact accurate and the upper bound on
the total number of ballots equals the total according to the manifest, ~2EZ
has no effect at all on the number of ballots audited nor on the true risk
limit.",1207.3413v1,stat.AP,2012-07-14 11:26:02+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Jorge H. Banuelos'), arxiv.Result.Author('Philip B. Stark')]",

permutations avoiding $132$ and $312$ with left factors of Dyck paths. In

522,Can Voters Detect Errors on Their Printed Ballots? Absolutely,"There is still debate on whether voters can detect malicious changes in their
printed ballot after making their selections on a Ballot Marking Device (BMD).
In this study, we altered votes on a voter's ballot after they had made their
selections on a BMD. We then required them to examine their ballots for any
changes from the slate they used to vote. Overall accuracy was exceptionally
high. Participants saw 1440 total contests, and of those 1440, there were a
total of 4 errors, so total accuracy was 99.8%. Participants were able to
perform with near-perfect accuracy regardless of ballot length, ballot type,
number of altered races, and location of altered races. Detection performance
was extremely robust. We conclude that with proper direction and resources,
voters can be near-perfect detectors of ballot changes on printed paper ballots
after voting with a BMD. This finding has significant implications for the
voting community as BMD use continues to grow. Research should now focus on
identifying administrative and behavioral methods that will prompt and
encourage voters to check their BMD-generated ballots before they drop them in

key tool is a planted plane tree and its increasing labellings. We also
introduce a generalized perfect matching which is bijective to an Hermite
history for a ballot tiling. By combining these objects, we obtain various

524,On the Distortion of Voting with Multiple Representative Candidates,"We study positional voting rules when candidates and voters are embedded in a
common metric space, and cardinal preferences are naturally given by distances
in the metric space. In a positional voting rule, each candidate receives a
score from each ballot based on the ballot's rank order; the candidate with the
highest total score wins the election. The cost of a candidate is his sum of
distances to all voters, and the distortion of an election is the ratio between
the cost of the elected candidate and the cost of the optimum candidate. We
consider the case when candidates are representative of the population, in the
sense that they are drawn i.i.d. from the population of the voters, and analyze
the expected distortion of positional voting rules.
  Our main result is a clean and tight characterization of positional voting
rules that have constant expected distortion (independent of the number of
candidates and the metric space). Our characterization result immediately
implies constant expected distortion for Borda Count and elections in which
each voter approves a constant fraction of all candidates. On the other hand,
we obtain super-constant expected distortion for Plurality, Veto, and approving
a constant number of candidates. These results contrast with previous results
on voting with metric preferences: When the candidates are chosen
adversarially, all of the preceding voting rules have distortion linear in the
number of candidates or voters. Thus, the model of representative candidates
allows us to distinguish voting rules which seem equally bad in the worst case.",1711.07600v1,cs.GT,2017-11-21 01:51:25+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Yu Cheng'), arxiv.Result.Author('Shaddin Dughmi'), arxiv.Result.Author('David Kempe')]",

malevolent adversary trying to buy real ballots. If the citizenry is divided
into subgroups (or districts), the adversary can construct a so-called ""Devil's
Menu"" consisting of several prices. In equilibrium, the adversary can buy the
real ballots of any strict subset of districts at a price corresponding to the
willingness to sell on the part of the citizens holding such ballots. By
contrast, decoy voters are trapped into selling their ballots at a low, or even
negligible, price. Blowing up the adversary's budget by introducing decoy
ballots may thus turn out to be futile. The Devil's Menu can also be applied to
the well-known ""Lemons Problem"".",1712.05477v1,cs.GT,2017-12-14 23:54:58+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Hans Gersbach'), arxiv.Result.Author('Akaki Mamageishvili'), arxiv.Result.Author('Oriol Tejada')]",

draw (ballot-by-ballot (B2) audits). On the other hand, real ballot polling
audits draw many ballots in a single round before determining whether to stop
(round-by-round (R2) audits). We show that BRAVO results in significant
inefficiency when directly applied to real R2 audits. We present the ATHENA
class of R2 stopping rules, which we show are risk-limiting if the round
schedule is pre-determined (before the audit begins). We prove that each rule

also preserves the neighbors of the largest letter in permutations and thus
resolves a refinement of Spiro' s conjecture proposed by Wang and Zhang. Our

535,Ballot Length in Instant Runoff Voting,"Instant runoff voting (IRV) is an increasingly-popular alternative to
traditional plurality voting in which voters submit rankings over the
candidates rather than single votes. In practice, elections using IRV often
restrict the ballot length, the number of candidates a voter is allowed to rank
on their ballot. We theoretically and empirically analyze how ballot length can
influence the outcome of an election, given fixed voter preferences. We show
that there exist preference profiles over $k$ candidates such that up to $k-1$
different candidates win at different ballot lengths. We derive exact lower
bounds on the number of voters required for such profiles and provide a
construction matching the lower bound for unrestricted voter preferences.
Additionally, we characterize which sequences of winners are possible over
ballot lengths and provide explicit profile constructions achieving any
feasible winner sequence. We also examine how classic preference restrictions
influence our results--for instance, single-peakedness makes $k-1$ different
winners impossible but still allows at least $\Omega(\sqrt k)$. Finally, we
analyze a collection of 168 real-world elections, where we truncate rankings to
simulate shorter ballots. We find that shorter ballots could have changed the
outcome in one quarter of these elections. Our results highlight ballot length
as a consequential degree of freedom in the design of IRV elections.",2207.08958v3,cs.MA,2022-07-18 22:01:13+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Kiran Tomlinson'), arxiv.Result.Author('Johan Ugander'), arxiv.Result.Author('Jon Kleinberg')]",

true peaks to be distinguished from the aliases. We provide an analytical proof
of the validity of this method and some demonstrations with simulated data. We
also propose to divide a long cadence into two unequal parts, aiming at
reproducing the intrinsic amplitude spectrum of stars without a severe smearing
effect due to long exposures. The two exposures can be summed to recover the
photon statistics if the user is interested in doing so. Based on these

540,Sampling-Based Winner Prediction in District-Based Elections,"In a district-based election, we apply a voting rule $r$ to decide the
winners in each district, and a candidate who wins in a maximum number of
districts is the winner of the election. We present efficient sampling-based
algorithms to predict the winner of such district-based election systems in
this paper. When $r$ is plurality and the margin of victory is known to be at
least $\varepsilon$ fraction of the total population, we present an algorithm
to predict the winner. The sample complexity of our algorithm is
$\mathcal{O}\left(\frac{1}{\varepsilon^4}\log
\frac{1}{\varepsilon}\log\frac{1}{\delta}\right)$. We complement this result by
proving that any algorithm, from a natural class of algorithms, for predicting
the winner in a district-based election when $r$ is plurality, must sample at
least $\Omega\left(\frac{1}{\varepsilon^4}\log\frac{1}{\delta}\right)$ votes.
We then extend this result to any voting rule $r$. Loosely speaking, we show
that we can predict the winner of a district-based election with an extra
overhead of
$\mathcal{O}\left(\frac{1}{\varepsilon^2}\log\frac{1}{\delta}\right)$ over the
sample complexity of predicting the single-district winner under $r$. We
further extend our algorithm for the case when the margin of victory is
unknown, but we have only two candidates. We then consider the median voting
rule when the set of preferences in each district is single-peaked. We show
that the winner of a district-based election can be predicted with
$\mathcal{O}\left(\frac{1}{\varepsilon^4}\log\frac{1}{\varepsilon}\log\frac{1}{\delta}\right)$

541,Agent-based Simulation of District-based Elections,"In district-based elections, electors cast votes in their respective
districts. In each district, the party with maximum votes wins the
corresponding seat in the governing body. The election result is based on the
number of seats won by different parties. In this system, locations of electors
across the districts may severely affect the election result even if the total
number of votes obtained by different parties remains unchanged. A less popular
party may end up winning more seats if their supporters are suitably
distributed spatially. This happens due to various regional and social
influences on individual voters which modulate their voting choice. In this
paper, we explore agent-based models for district-based elections, where we
consider each elector as an agent, and try to represent their social and
geographical attributes and political inclinations using probability
distributions. This model can be used to simulate election results by Monte
Carlo sampling. The models allow us to explore the full space of possible
outcomes of an electoral setting, though they can also be calibrated to actual
election results for suitable values of parameters. We use Approximate Bayesian
Computation (ABC) framework to estimate model parameters. We show that our

542,District-Fair Participatory Budgeting,"Participatory budgeting is a method used by city governments to select public
projects to fund based on residents' votes. Many cities use participatory
budgeting at a district level. Typically, a budget is divided among districts
proportionally to their population, and each district holds an election over
local projects and then uses its budget to fund the projects most preferred by
its voters. However, district-level participatory budgeting can yield poor
social welfare because it does not necessarily fund projects supported across
multiple districts. On the other hand, decision making that only takes global
social welfare into account can be unfair to districts: A
social-welfare-maximizing solution might not fund any of the projects preferred
by a district, despite the fact that its constituents pay taxes to the city.
Thus, we study how to fairly maximize social welfare in a participatory
budgeting setting with a single city-wide election. We propose a notion of
fairness that guarantees each district at least as much welfare as it would
have received in a district-level election. We show that, although optimizing
social welfare subject to this notion of fairness is NP-hard, we can
efficiently construct a lottery over welfare-optimal outcomes that is fair in
expectation. Moreover, we show that, when we are allowed to slightly relax
fairness, we can efficiently compute a fair solution that is
welfare-maximizing, but which may overspend the budget.",2102.06115v1,cs.GT,2021-02-11 16:55:57+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('D Ellis Hershkowitz'), arxiv.Result.Author('Anson Kahng'), arxiv.Result.Author('Dominik Peters'), arxiv.Result.Author('Ariel D. Procaccia')]",
543,Electoral David vs Goliath: How does the Spatial Concentration of Electors affect District-based Elections?,"Many democratic countries use district-based elections where there is a
""seat"" for each district in the governing body. In each district, the party
whose candidate gets the maximum number of votes wins the corresponding seat.
The result of the election is decided based on the number of seats won by the
different parties. The electors (voters) can cast their votes only in the
district of their residence. Thus, locations of the electors and boundaries of
the districts may severely affect the election result even if the proportion of
popular support (number of electors) of different parties remains unchanged.
This has led to significant amount of research on whether the districts may be
redrawn or electors may be moved to maximize seats for a particular party. In
this paper, we frame the spatial distribution of electors in a probabilistic
setting, and explore different models to capture the intra-district
polarization of electors in favour of a party, or the spatial concentration of
supporters of different parties. Our models are inspired by elections in India,
where supporters of different parties tend to be concentrated in certain
districts. We show with extensive simulations that our model can capture
different statistical properties of real elections held in India. We frame
parameter estimation problems to fit our models to the observed election
results. Since analytical calculation of the likelihood functions are
infeasible for our complex models, we use Likelihood-free Inference methods
under the Approximate Bayesian Computation framework. Since this approach is
highly time-consuming, we explore how supervised regression using Logistic
Regression or Deep Neural Networks can be used to speed it up. We also explore
how the election results can change by varying the spatial distributions of the

544,Exploring Fairness in District-based Multi-party Elections under different Voting Rules using Stochastic Simulations,"Many democratic societies use district-based elections, where the region
under consideration is geographically divided into districts and a
representative is chosen for each district based on the preferences of the
electors who reside there. These representatives belong to political parties,
and the executive powers are acquired by that party which has a majority of the
elected district representatives. In most systems, each elector can express
preference for one candidate, though they may have a complete or partial
ranking of the candidates/parties. We show that this can lead to situations
where many electors are dissatisfied with the election results, which is not
desirable in a democracy. The results may be biased towards the supporters of a
particular party, and against others. Inspired by current literature on
fairness of Machine Learning algorithms, we define measures of fairness to
quantify the satisfaction of electors, irrespective of their political choices.
We also consider alternative election policies using concepts of voting rules
and rank aggregation, to enable voters to express their detailed preferences
without making the electoral process cumbersome or opaque. We then evaluate
these policies using the aforementioned fairness measures with the help of
Monte Carlo simulations. Such simulations are obtained using a proposed
stochastic model for election simulation, that takes into account community
identities of electors and its role in influencing their residence and
political preferences. We show that this model can simulate actual multi-party
elections in India. Through extensive simulations, we find that allowing voters
to provide 2 preferences reduces the disparity between supporters of different

546,Identifying Possible Winners in Ranked Choice Voting Elections with Outstanding Ballots,"Several election districts in the US have recently moved to ranked-choice
voting (RCV) to decide the results of local elections. RCV allows voters to
rank their choices, and the results are computed in rounds, eliminating one
candidate at a time. RCV ensures fairer elections and has been shown to
increase elected representation of women and people of color. A main drawback
of RCV is that the round-by-round process requires all the ballots to be
tallied before the results of an election can be calculated. With increasingly
large portions of ballots coming from absentee voters, RCV election outcomes
are not always apparent on election night, and can take several weeks to be
published, leading to a loss of trust in the electoral process from the public.
In this paper, we present an algorithm for efficiently computing possible
winners of RCV elections from partially known ballots and evaluate it on data
from the recent New York City Primary elections. We show that our techniques
allow to significantly narrow down the field of possible election winners, and

advantage to manipulate the outcome of an election. In particular, we study
district-based elections with two candidates, in which the winner of the

District-based elections are adopted worldwide (e.g., UK and USA) and are a
natural extension of widely studied voting mechanisms (e.g., k-voting and
plurality voting). We resort to the Bayesian persuasion framework, where the
manipulator (sender) strategically discloses information to the voters
(receivers) that update their beliefs rationally. We study both private
signaling, in which the sender can use a private communication channel per
receiver, and public signaling, in which the sender can use a single
communication channel for all the receivers. Furthermore, for the first time,
we introduce semi-public signaling in which the sender can use a single
communication channel per district. We show that there is a sharp distinction
between private and (semi-)public signaling. In particular, optimal private
signaling schemes can provide an arbitrarily better probability of victory than
(semi-)public ones and can be computed efficiently, while optimal (semi-)public
signaling schemes cannot be approximated to within any factor in polynomial
time unless P=NP. However, we show that reasonable relaxations allow the design
of multi-criteria PTASs for optimal (semi-)public signaling schemes. In doing
so, we introduce a novel property, namely comparative stability, and we design
a bi-criteria PTAS for public signaling in general Bayesian persuasion problems

single-member voting district plans for a hypothetical city council election. A
fair district plan is defined as one where the number of minority-majority
districts is proportional to the city-wide minority population. Thus each city
is summarized by three traits: minority percent, a measure of segregation, and
availability of a fair district plan. We find that when the minority population
is around 25%-33%, there is a positive correlation between the degree of
segregation and the availability of proportional district plan. Consistently,
when the minority population lives in a more diffuse residential pattern, there
are fewer available proportional district plans. Finally, we develop a new
method to validate runtime and sample size of an ensemble of district plans

of previously lost districts which that party potentially could have had a 50%
chance of winning, without risking any currently won districts, by making
reasonable changes to the input map. We then analyze GEO metric scores for each

empirically test this prediction, I compile one of the most comprehensive
datasets to date on the political careers of all district attorneys in office
during the steepest rise in incarceration in U.S. history (roughly 1986-2006).
Using quasi-experimental methods, I find causal evidence that being in a DA
election year increases total admissions per capita and total months sentenced
per capita. I estimate that the election year effects on admissions are akin to
moving 0.85 standard deviations along the distribution of DA behavior within
state (e.g., going from the 50th to 80th percentile in sentencing intensity). I
find evidence that election effects are larger (1) when DA elections are
contested, (2) in Republican counties, and (3) in the southern United
States--all these factors are consistent with the perspective that election
effects arise from political incentives influencing DAs. Further, I find that
district attorney election effects decline over the period 1986-2006, in tandem

that (i) the favorite alternative of the briber wins the resulting election,
(ii) the modification is budget feasible, and (iii) every new district is
connected. We study four natural variants of the above problem -- the graph on
voter being arbitrary vs complete graph (corresponds to removing connectedness
requirement for districts) and the cost of bribing every voter being uniform vs
non-uniform. We show that all the four problems are NP-complete even under

557,Gerrymandering Trees: Parameterized Hardness,"In a representative democracy, elections involve partitioning geographical
space into districts which each elect a single representative. Legislation is
then determined by votes from these representatives, and thus political parties
are incentivized to win as many districts as possible (ideally a plurality).
Gerrymandering is the process by which these districts' boundaries are
manipulated to give favor to a certain candidate or party. Cohen-Zemach et al.
(AAMAS 2018) proposed Gerrymandering as a formalization of this problem on
graphs (as opposed to Euclidean space) where districts partition vertices into
connected subgraphs. More recently, Gupta et al. (SAGT 2021) studied its
parameterized complexity and gave an FPT algorithm for paths with respect to
the number of districts $k$. We prove that Gerrymandering is W[2]-hard on trees
(even when the depth is two) with respect to $k$, answering an open question of
Gupta et al. Moreover, we prove that Gerrymandering remains W[2]-hard in trees

peaceful and seamless transfer of power from one leader to another.
Democratically, this is measured in a citizen population's trust in the

560,Sampling-Based Winner Prediction in District-Based Elections,"In a district-based election, we apply a voting rule $r$ to decide the
winners in each district, and a candidate who wins in a maximum number of
districts is the winner of the election. We present efficient sampling-based
algorithms to predict the winner of such district-based election systems in
this paper. When $r$ is plurality and the margin of victory is known to be at
least $\varepsilon$ fraction of the total population, we present an algorithm
to predict the winner. The sample complexity of our algorithm is
$\mathcal{O}\left(\frac{1}{\varepsilon^4}\log
\frac{1}{\varepsilon}\log\frac{1}{\delta}\right)$. We complement this result by
proving that any algorithm, from a natural class of algorithms, for predicting
the winner in a district-based election when $r$ is plurality, must sample at
least $\Omega\left(\frac{1}{\varepsilon^4}\log\frac{1}{\delta}\right)$ votes.
We then extend this result to any voting rule $r$. Loosely speaking, we show
that we can predict the winner of a district-based election with an extra
overhead of
$\mathcal{O}\left(\frac{1}{\varepsilon^2}\log\frac{1}{\delta}\right)$ over the
sample complexity of predicting the single-district winner under $r$. We
further extend our algorithm for the case when the margin of victory is
unknown, but we have only two candidates. We then consider the median voting
rule when the set of preferences in each district is single-peaked. We show
that the winner of a district-based election can be predicted with
$\mathcal{O}\left(\frac{1}{\varepsilon^4}\log\frac{1}{\varepsilon}\log\frac{1}{\delta}\right)$
samples even when the harmonious order in different districts can be different

districts. In each district, the party with maximum votes wins the
corresponding seat in the governing body. The election result is based on the
number of seats won by different parties. In this system, locations of electors
across the districts may severely affect the election result even if the total
number of votes obtained by different parties remains unchanged. A less popular
party may end up winning more seats if their supporters are suitably
distributed spatially. This happens due to various regional and social
influences on individual voters which modulate their voting choice. In this
paper, we explore agent-based models for district-based elections, where we
consider each elector as an agent, and try to represent their social and
geographical attributes and political inclinations using probability
distributions. This model can be used to simulate election results by Monte
Carlo sampling. The models allow us to explore the full space of possible
outcomes of an electoral setting, though they can also be calibrated to actual
election results for suitable values of parameters. We use Approximate Bayesian
Computation (ABC) framework to estimate model parameters. We show that our
model can reproduce the results of elections held in India and USA, and can

562,District-Fair Participatory Budgeting,"Participatory budgeting is a method used by city governments to select public
projects to fund based on residents' votes. Many cities use participatory
budgeting at a district level. Typically, a budget is divided among districts
proportionally to their population, and each district holds an election over
local projects and then uses its budget to fund the projects most preferred by
its voters. However, district-level participatory budgeting can yield poor
social welfare because it does not necessarily fund projects supported across
multiple districts. On the other hand, decision making that only takes global
social welfare into account can be unfair to districts: A
social-welfare-maximizing solution might not fund any of the projects preferred
by a district, despite the fact that its constituents pay taxes to the city.
Thus, we study how to fairly maximize social welfare in a participatory
budgeting setting with a single city-wide election. We propose a notion of
fairness that guarantees each district at least as much welfare as it would
have received in a district-level election. We show that, although optimizing
social welfare subject to this notion of fairness is NP-hard, we can
efficiently construct a lottery over welfare-optimal outcomes that is fair in
expectation. Moreover, we show that, when we are allowed to slightly relax
fairness, we can efficiently compute a fair solution that is
welfare-maximizing, but which may overspend the budget.",2102.06115v1,cs.GT,2021-02-11 16:55:57+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('D Ellis Hershkowitz'), arxiv.Result.Author('Anson Kahng'), arxiv.Result.Author('Dominik Peters'), arxiv.Result.Author('Ariel D. Procaccia')]",
563,Electoral David vs Goliath: How does the Spatial Concentration of Electors affect District-based Elections?,"Many democratic countries use district-based elections where there is a
""seat"" for each district in the governing body. In each district, the party
whose candidate gets the maximum number of votes wins the corresponding seat.
The result of the election is decided based on the number of seats won by the
different parties. The electors (voters) can cast their votes only in the
district of their residence. Thus, locations of the electors and boundaries of
the districts may severely affect the election result even if the proportion of
popular support (number of electors) of different parties remains unchanged.
This has led to significant amount of research on whether the districts may be
redrawn or electors may be moved to maximize seats for a particular party. In
this paper, we frame the spatial distribution of electors in a probabilistic
setting, and explore different models to capture the intra-district
polarization of electors in favour of a party, or the spatial concentration of
supporters of different parties. Our models are inspired by elections in India,
where supporters of different parties tend to be concentrated in certain
districts. We show with extensive simulations that our model can capture
different statistical properties of real elections held in India. We frame
parameter estimation problems to fit our models to the observed election
results. Since analytical calculation of the likelihood functions are
infeasible for our complex models, we use Likelihood-free Inference methods
under the Approximate Bayesian Computation framework. Since this approach is
highly time-consuming, we explore how supervised regression using Logistic
Regression or Deep Neural Networks can be used to speed it up. We also explore
how the election results can change by varying the spatial distributions of the
voters, even when the proportions of popular support of the parties remain

564,Exploring Fairness in District-based Multi-party Elections under different Voting Rules using Stochastic Simulations,"Many democratic societies use district-based elections, where the region
under consideration is geographically divided into districts and a
representative is chosen for each district based on the preferences of the
electors who reside there. These representatives belong to political parties,
and the executive powers are acquired by that party which has a majority of the
elected district representatives. In most systems, each elector can express
preference for one candidate, though they may have a complete or partial
ranking of the candidates/parties. We show that this can lead to situations
where many electors are dissatisfied with the election results, which is not
desirable in a democracy. The results may be biased towards the supporters of a
particular party, and against others. Inspired by current literature on
fairness of Machine Learning algorithms, we define measures of fairness to
quantify the satisfaction of electors, irrespective of their political choices.
We also consider alternative election policies using concepts of voting rules
and rank aggregation, to enable voters to express their detailed preferences
without making the electoral process cumbersome or opaque. We then evaluate
these policies using the aforementioned fairness measures with the help of
Monte Carlo simulations. Such simulations are obtained using a proposed
stochastic model for election simulation, that takes into account community
identities of electors and its role in influencing their residence and
political preferences. We show that this model can simulate actual multi-party
elections in India. Through extensive simulations, we find that allowing voters
to provide 2 preferences reduces the disparity between supporters of different
parties in terms of the election result.",2203.03720v1,cs.CY,2022-02-25 18:03:03+00:00,[arxiv.Result.Author('Adway Mitra')],

state databases containing information about which citizens are eligible to
vote. Administrators at the state and local level are faced with the
exceedingly difficult task of ensuring that each of their jurisdictions is
properly managed, while also monitoring for improper modifications to the
database. Monitoring changes to Voter Registration Files (VRFs) is crucial,
given that a malicious actor wishing to disrupt the democratic process in the
US would be well-advised to manipulate the contents of these files in order to
achieve their goals. In 2020, we saw election officials perform admirably when
faced with administering one of the most contentious elections in US history,
but much work remains to secure and monitor the election systems Americans rely
on. Using data created by comparing snapshots taken of VRFs over time, we
present a set of methods that make use of machine learning to ease the burden

effectiveness of multiple unsupervised anomaly detection methods in detecting
VRF modifications by modeling anomalous changes as sparse additive noise. In
this setting we determine that statistical models comparing administrative
districts within a short time span and non-negative matrix factorization are
most effective for surfacing anomalous events for review. These methods were
deployed during 2019-2020 in our organization's monitoring system and were used
in collaboration with the office of the Iowa Secretary of State. Additionally,

567,Identifying Possible Winners in Ranked Choice Voting Elections with Outstanding Ballots,"Several election districts in the US have recently moved to ranked-choice
voting (RCV) to decide the results of local elections. RCV allows voters to
rank their choices, and the results are computed in rounds, eliminating one
candidate at a time. RCV ensures fairer elections and has been shown to
increase elected representation of women and people of color. A main drawback
of RCV is that the round-by-round process requires all the ballots to be
tallied before the results of an election can be calculated. With increasingly
large portions of ballots coming from absentee voters, RCV election outcomes
are not always apparent on election night, and can take several weeks to be
published, leading to a loss of trust in the electoral process from the public.
In this paper, we present an algorithm for efficiently computing possible
winners of RCV elections from partially known ballots and evaluate it on data
from the recent New York City Primary elections. We show that our techniques
allow to significantly narrow down the field of possible election winners, and
in some case identify the winner as soon as election night despite a number of

advantage to manipulate the outcome of an election. In particular, we study
district-based elections with two candidates, in which the winner of the
election is the candidate that wins in the majority of the districts.
District-based elections are adopted worldwide (e.g., UK and USA) and are a
natural extension of widely studied voting mechanisms (e.g., k-voting and
plurality voting). We resort to the Bayesian persuasion framework, where the
manipulator (sender) strategically discloses information to the voters
(receivers) that update their beliefs rationally. We study both private
signaling, in which the sender can use a private communication channel per
receiver, and public signaling, in which the sender can use a single
communication channel for all the receivers. Furthermore, for the first time,
we introduce semi-public signaling in which the sender can use a single
communication channel per district. We show that there is a sharp distinction
between private and (semi-)public signaling. In particular, optimal private
signaling schemes can provide an arbitrarily better probability of victory than
(semi-)public ones and can be computed efficiently, while optimal (semi-)public
signaling schemes cannot be approximated to within any factor in polynomial
time unless P=NP. However, we show that reasonable relaxations allow the design
of multi-criteria PTASs for optimal (semi-)public signaling schemes. In doing
so, we introduce a novel property, namely comparative stability, and we design
a bi-criteria PTAS for public signaling in general Bayesian persuasion problems

single-member voting district plans for a hypothetical city council election. A
fair district plan is defined as one where the number of minority-majority
districts is proportional to the city-wide minority population. Thus each city
is summarized by three traits: minority percent, a measure of segregation, and
availability of a fair district plan. We find that when the minority population
is around 25%-33%, there is a positive correlation between the degree of
segregation and the availability of proportional district plan. Consistently,
when the minority population lives in a more diffuse residential pattern, there
are fewer available proportional district plans. Finally, we develop a new
method to validate runtime and sample size of an ensemble of district plans

biased way of partitioning the state into electoral districts such that based
on a priori knowledge it has more chances to win in a maximum possible number

a particular party benefits from a given districting map under a parallel

non-negative integer) to each political party. The count indicates the number
of previously lost districts which that party potentially could have had a 50%
chance of winning, without risking any currently won districts, by making
reasonable changes to the input map. We then analyze GEO metric scores for each

empirically test this prediction, I compile one of the most comprehensive
datasets to date on the political careers of all district attorneys in office
during the steepest rise in incarceration in U.S. history (roughly 1986-2006).
Using quasi-experimental methods, I find causal evidence that being in a DA
election year increases total admissions per capita and total months sentenced
per capita. I estimate that the election year effects on admissions are akin to
moving 0.85 standard deviations along the distribution of DA behavior within
state (e.g., going from the 50th to 80th percentile in sentencing intensity). I
find evidence that election effects are larger (1) when DA elections are
contested, (2) in Republican counties, and (3) in the southern United
States--all these factors are consistent with the perspective that election
effects arise from political incentives influencing DAs. Further, I find that
district attorney election effects decline over the period 1986-2006, in tandem

findings suggest DA behavior may respond to voter preferences--in particular to

briber. The briber needs to compute if the given partition can be modified so
that (i) the favorite alternative of the briber wins the resulting election,
(ii) the modification is budget feasible, and (iii) every new district is

voter being arbitrary vs complete graph (corresponds to removing connectedness
requirement for districts) and the cost of bribing every voter being uniform vs
non-uniform. We show that all the four problems are NP-complete even under

586,A reduced-order model for dynamic simulation of district heating networks,"This study concerns the development of a data-based compact model for the
prediction of the fluid temperature evolution in district heating (DH) pipeline
networks. This so-called ""reduced-order model"" (ROM) is obtained from reduction
of the conservation law for energy for each pipe segment to a semi-analytical
input-output relation between the pipe outlet temperature and the pipe inlet
and ground temperatures that can be identified from training data. The ROM
basically is valid for generic pipe configurations involving 3D unsteady heat
transfer and 3D steady flow as long as heat-transfer mechanisms are linearly
dependent on the temperature field. Moreover, the training data can be
generated by physics-based computational ""full-order"" models (FOMs) yet also by
(calibration) experiments or field measurements. Performance tests using
computational training data for a single 1D pipe configuration demonstrate that
the ROM (i) can be successfully identified and (ii) can accurately describe the
response of the outlet temperature to arbitrary input profiles for inlet and
ground temperatures. Application of the ROM to two case studies, i.e. fast
simulation of a small DH network and design of a controller for user-defined
temperature regulation of a DH system, demonstrate its predictive ability and
efficiency also for realistic systems. Dedicated cost analyses further reveal
that the ROM may significantly reduce the computational costs compared to FOMs
by (up to) orders of magnitude for higher-dimensional pipe configurations.
These findings advance the proposed ROM as a robust and efficient simulation
tool for practical DH systems with a far greater predictive ability than
existing compact models.",2211.14119v1,math.NA,2022-11-25 14:02:02+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Mengting Jiang'), arxiv.Result.Author('Michel Speetjens'), arxiv.Result.Author('Camilo Rindt'), arxiv.Result.Author('David Smeulders')]",

to properly district given their limited capacities. The computed solutions
highlighted differences in how humans and machines solve this task with machine
solutions more fully optimized and displaying emergent properties not evident
in human solutions. These results suggest a division of labour in which humans
debate and formulate districting criteria whereas machines optimize the
criteria to draw the district boundaries. We discuss how criteria can be

single-member voting district plans for a hypothetical city council election. A
fair district plan is defined as one where the number of minority-majority
districts is proportional to the city-wide minority population. Thus each city
is summarized by three traits: minority percent, a measure of segregation, and
availability of a fair district plan. We find that when the minority population
is around 25%-33%, there is a positive correlation between the degree of
segregation and the availability of proportional district plan. Consistently,
when the minority population lives in a more diffuse residential pattern, there
are fewer available proportional district plans. Finally, we develop a new

595,District-Fair Participatory Budgeting,"Participatory budgeting is a method used by city governments to select public
projects to fund based on residents' votes. Many cities use participatory
budgeting at a district level. Typically, a budget is divided among districts
proportionally to their population, and each district holds an election over
local projects and then uses its budget to fund the projects most preferred by
its voters. However, district-level participatory budgeting can yield poor
social welfare because it does not necessarily fund projects supported across
multiple districts. On the other hand, decision making that only takes global
social welfare into account can be unfair to districts: A
social-welfare-maximizing solution might not fund any of the projects preferred
by a district, despite the fact that its constituents pay taxes to the city.
Thus, we study how to fairly maximize social welfare in a participatory
budgeting setting with a single city-wide election. We propose a notion of
fairness that guarantees each district at least as much welfare as it would
have received in a district-level election. We show that, although optimizing
social welfare subject to this notion of fairness is NP-hard, we can
efficiently construct a lottery over welfare-optimal outcomes that is fair in
expectation. Moreover, we show that, when we are allowed to slightly relax
fairness, we can efficiently compute a fair solution that is
welfare-maximizing, but which may overspend the budget.",2102.06115v1,cs.GT,2021-02-11 16:55:57+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('D Ellis Hershkowitz'), arxiv.Result.Author('Anson Kahng'), arxiv.Result.Author('Dominik Peters'), arxiv.Result.Author('Ariel D. Procaccia')]",

the most frequent color occurs at most a given number of times more often than

various real-world scenarios where agents of different types, which are

disjoint districts. Herein, one strives for ""fair districts"" without any type
being in a dominating majority in any of the districts. This is to e.g. prevent
segregation or political domination of some political party. We conduct a
fine-grained analysis of the (parameterized) computational complexity of Fair
Connected Districting. In particular, we prove that it is polynomial-time
solvable on paths, cycles, stars, and caterpillars, but already becomes NP-hard
on trees. Motivated by the latter negative result, we perform a parameterized
complexity analysis with respect to various graph parameters, including
treewidth, and problem-specific parameters, including, the numbers of colors

explicitly optimize for arbitrary piecewise-linear definitions of fairness. The
first stage is a randomized divide-and-conquer column generation heuristic

the compositional structure of graph partitioning problems. This district
ensemble forms the input to a master selection problem to choose the districts
to include in the final plan. Our decoupled design allows for unprecedented

607,Critical states in Political Trends. How much reliable is a poll on Twitter? A study by means of the Potts Model,"In recent years, Twitter data related to political trends have tentatively
been used to make predictions (poll) about several electoral events. Given $q$
candidates for an election and a time-series of Twitts (short messages), one
can extract the $q$ mean trends and the $q(q+1)/2$ Twitt-to-Twitt correlations,
and look for the statistical models that reproduce these data. On the base of
several electoral events and assuming a stationary regime, we find out the
following: i) the maximization of the entropy singles out a microscopic model
(single-Twitt-level) that coincides with a $q$-state Potts model having
suitable couplings and external fields to be determined via an inverse problem
from the two sets of data; ii) correlations decay as $1/N_{eff}$, where
$N_{eff}$ is a small fraction of the mean number of Twitts; iii) the simplest
statistical models that reproduce these correlations are the multinomial
distribution (MD), characterized by $q$ external fields, and the mean-field
Potts model (MFP), characterized by one coupling; iv) remarkably, this coupling
turns out to be always close to its critical value. This results in a MD or MFP
model scenario that discriminates between cases in which polls are reliable and
not reliable, respectively. More precisely, predictions based on polls should
be avoided whenever the data maps to a MFP because anomalous large fluctuations
(if $q=2$) or sudden jumps (if $q\geq 3$) in the trends might take place as a
result of a second-order or a first-order phase transition of the MFP,
respectively.",1901.10984v1,cond-mat.stat-mech,2019-01-30 18:25:48+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Lucas Nicolao'), arxiv.Result.Author('Massimo Ostilli')]","Physica A 533, 121920 (2019)"
608,Testing for voter rigging in small polling stations,"Since the 1970s there has been a large number of countries that combine
formal democratic institutions with authoritarian practices. Although in such
countries the ruling elites may receive considerable voter support they often
employ several manipulation tools to control election outcomes. A common
practice of these regimes is the coercion and mobilization of a significant
amount of voters to guarantee the electoral victory. This electoral
irregularity is known as voter rigging, distinguishing it from vote rigging,
which involves ballot stuffing or stealing. Here we develop a statistical test
to quantify to which extent the results of a particular election display traces
of voter rigging. Our key hypothesis is that small polling stations are more
susceptible to voter rigging, because it is easier to identify opposing
individuals, there are less eye witnesses, and supposedly less visits from
election observers. We devise a general statistical method for testing whether
voting behavior in small polling stations is significantly different from the
behavior of their neighbor stations in a way that is consistent with the
widespread occurrence of voter rigging. Based on a comparative analysis, the
method enables to rule out whether observed differences in voting behavior
might be explained by geographic heterogeneities in vote preferences. We
analyze 21 elections in ten different countries and find significant anomalies
compatible with voter rigging in Russia from 2007-2011, in Venezuela from
2006-2013, and in Uganda 2011. Particularly disturbing is the case of Venezuela
where these distortions have been outcome-determinative in the 2013
presidential elections.",1604.07689v1,stat.AP,2016-04-26 14:29:08+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Raúl Jiménez'), arxiv.Result.Author('Manuel Hidalgo'), arxiv.Result.Author('Peter Klimek')]",
609,Selecting Voting Locations for Fun and Profit,"While manipulative attacks on elections have been well-studied, only recently
has attention turned to attacks that account for geographic information, which
are extremely common in the real world. The most well known in the media is
gerrymandering, in which district border-lines are changed to increase a
party's chance to win, but a different geographical manipulation involves
influencing the election by selecting the location of polling places, as many
people are not willing to go to any distance to vote. In this paper we initiate
the study of this manipulation. We find that while it is easy to manipulate the
selection of polling places on the line, it becomes difficult already on the
plane or in the case of more than two candidates. Moreover, we show that for
more than two candidates the problem is inapproximable. However, we find a few
restricted cases on the plane where some algorithms perform well. Finally, we
discuss how existing results for standard control actions hold in the
geographic setting, consider additional control actions in the geographic
setting, and suggest directions for future study.",2003.06879v1,cs.GT,2020-03-15 17:49:50+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Zack Fitzsimmons'), arxiv.Result.Author('Omer Lev')]",
610,Mining the Demographics of Political Sentiment from Twitter Using Learning from Label Proportions,"Opinion mining and demographic attribute inference have many applications in
social science. In this paper, we propose models to infer daily joint
probabilities of multiple latent attributes from Twitter data, such as
political sentiment and demographic attributes. Since it is costly and
time-consuming to annotate data for traditional supervised classification, we
instead propose scalable Learning from Label Proportions (LLP) models for
demographic and opinion inference using U.S. Census, national and state
political polls, and Cook partisan voting index as population level data. In
LLP classification settings, the training data is divided into a set of
unlabeled bags, where only the label distribution in of each bag is known,
removing the requirement of instance-level annotations. Our proposed LLP model,
Weighted Label Regularization (WLR), provides a scalable generalization of
prior work on label regularization to support weights for samples inside bags,
which is applicable in this setting where bags are arranged hierarchically
(e.g., county-level bags are nested inside of state-level bags). We apply our
model to Twitter data collected in the year leading up to the 2016 U.S.
presidential election, producing estimates of the relationships among political
sentiment and demographics over time and place. We find that our approach
closely tracks traditional polling data stratified by demographic category,
resulting in error reductions of 28-44% over baseline approaches. We also
provide descriptive evaluations showing how the model may be used to estimate
interactions among many variables and to identify linguistic temporal
variation, capabilities which are typically not feasible using traditional
polling methods.",1708.08000v1,cs.SI,2017-08-26 17:48:20+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Ehsan Mohammady Ardehaly'), arxiv.Result.Author('Aron Culotta')]",
611,Metronome: adaptive and precise intermittent packet retrieval in DPDK,"The increasing performance requirements of modern applications place a
significant burden on software-based packet processing. Most of today's
software input/output accelerations achieve high performance at the expense of
reserving CPU resources dedicated to continuously poll the Network Interface
Card. This is specifically the case with DPDK (Data Plane Development Kit),
probably the most widely used framework for software-based packet processing
today. The approach presented in this paper, descriptively called Metronome,
has the dual goals of providing CPU utilization proportional to the load, and
allowing flexible sharing of CPU resources between I/O tasks and applications.
Metronome replaces DPDK's continuous polling with an intermittent sleep&wake
mode, and revolves around a new multi-threaded operation, which improves
service continuity. Since the proposed operation trades CPU usage with
buffering delay, we propose an analytical model devised to dynamically adapt
the sleep&wake parameters to the actual traffic load, meanwhile providing a
target average latency. Our experimental results show a significant reduction
of the CPU cycles, improvements in power usage, and robustness to CPU sharing
even when challenged with CPU-intensive applications.",2103.13263v3,cs.NI,2021-03-24 15:27:24+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Marco Faltelli'), arxiv.Result.Author('Giacomo Belocchi'), arxiv.Result.Author('Francesco Quaglia'), arxiv.Result.Author('Salvatore Pontarelli'), arxiv.Result.Author('Giuseppe Bianchi')]",
612,Evidence of Systematic Bias in 2008 Presidential Polling (preliminary report),"Political polls achieve their results by sampling a small number of potential
voters rather than the population as a whole. This leads to sampling error
which most polling agencies dutifully report. But factors such as
nonrepresentative samples, question wording and nonresponse can produce
non-sampling errors. While pollsters are aware of such errors, they are
difficult to quantify and seldom reported. When a polling agency, whether by
intention or not, produces results with non-sampling errors that systematically
favor one candidate over another, then that agency's poll is biased. We
analyzed polling data for the (on-going) 2008 Presidential race, and though our
methods do not allow us to identify which agencies' polls are biased, they do
provide significant evidence that some agencies' polls are.
  We compared polls produced by major television networks with those produced
by Gallup and Rasmussen. We found that, taken as a whole, polls produced by the
networks were significantly to the left of those produced by Gallup and
Rasmussen. We used the available data to provide a tentative ordering of the
major television networks' polls from right to left. Our order was: FOX, CNN,
NBC (which partners with the Wall Street Journal), ABC (which partners with the
Washington Post), CBS (which partners with the New York Times). These results
appear to comport well with the informal perceptions of the political leanings
of these agencies.
  Our findings are preliminary, but they make a case for further research into
the causes of and remedies for polling bias.",0810.5603v1,stat.AP,2008-10-30 07:18:23+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Leonard Adleman'), arxiv.Result.Author('Mark Schilling')]",
613,Adaptive Polling in Hierarchical Social Networks using Blackwell Dominance,"Consider a population of individuals that observe an underlying state of
nature that evolves over time. The population is classified into different
levels depending on the hierarchical influence that dictates how the
individuals at each level form an opinion on the state. The population is
sampled sequentially by a pollster and the nodes (or individuals) respond to
the questions asked by the pollster. This paper considers the following
problem: How should the pollster poll the hierarchical social network to
estimate the state while minimizing the polling cost (measurement cost and
uncertainty in the Bayesian state estimate)? This paper proposes adaptive
versions of the following polling methods: Intent Polling, Expectation Polling,
and the recently proposed Neighbourhood Expectation Polling to account for the
time varying state of nature and the hierarchical influence in social networks.
The adaptive polling problem in a hierarchical social network is formulated as
a partially observed Markov decision process (POMDP). Our main results exploit
the structure of the polling problem, and determine novel conditions for
Blackwell dominance to construct myopic policies that provably upper bound the
optimal policy of the adaptive polling POMDP. The LeCam deficiency is used to
determine approximate Blackwell dominance for general polling problems. These
Blackwell dominance conditions also facilitate the comparison of Renyi
Divergence and Shannon capacity of more general channel structures that arise
in hierarchical social networks. Numerical examples are provided to illustrate
the adaptive polling policies with parameters estimated from YouTube data.",1810.00571v1,cs.SI,2018-10-01 08:23:38+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Sujay Bhatt'), arxiv.Result.Author('Vikram Krishnamurthy')]",
614,Novel Active Disturbance Rejection Control Based on Nested Linear Extended State Observers,"In this paper, a Novel Active Disturbance Rejection Control (N-ADRC) strategy
is proposed that replaces the Linear Extended state observer (LESO) used in
Conventional ADRC (C-ADRC) with a Nested LESO. In the nested LESO, the
inner-loop LESO actively estimates and eliminates the generalized disturbance.
Increasing the bandwidth improves the estimation accuracy which may tolerate
noise and conflict with H/W limitations and the sampling frequency of the
system. Therefore, an alternative scenario is offered without increasing the
bandwidth of the inner-loop LESO provided that the rate of change of the
generalized disturbance estimation error is upper bounded. This is achieved by
the placing an outer-loop LESO in parallel with the inner one, it estimates and
eliminates the remaining generalized disturbance that eluded from the
inner-loop LESO due to bandwidth limitations. The stability of LESO and nested
LESO is investigated using Lyapunov stability analysis. Simulations on
uncertain nonlinear SISO system with time-varying exogenous disturbance
revealed that the proposed nested LESO can successfully deal with a generalized
disturbance in both noisy and noise-free environments, where the Integral Time
Absolute Error (ITAE) of the tracking error for the nested LESO is reduced by
69.87% from that of the LESO.",1805.00505v3,cs.SY,2018-05-01 18:27:28+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Wameedh R. Abdul-Adheem'), arxiv.Result.Author('Ibraheem K. Ibraheem')]",

they are now a defacto component of our daily news cycle and because their
results influence governments and business in ways which are not always obvious
to us. However, polling is not always accurate and there have been some really
inaccurate polling results which have had major influences on the world going
back to the 1930s but also as recently as just the last 3 or 4 years. In this
paper we analyse the phenomenon of socially desirable responding (shy voters)
which has emerged as one of the reasons for modern day inaccurate polling. We
describe how it can be exposed through implicit association tests (IATs) and we
demonstrate the shy voter effect in a small survey on opinions in Ireland
towards the United Kingdom. We argue for inclusion of IATs in traditional
polling and point to the fact that these can be conducted accurately online,
which also allows polling to reach a larger and more diverse sample of

opportunities for poll sampling from the general public.",2007.04183v1,cs.CY,2020-07-08 15:16:15+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Alan Smeaton'), arxiv.Result.Author('Hyowon Lee'), arxiv.Result.Author('Niamh Morris'), arxiv.Result.Author('David Hanley')]",
616,Bias and Excess Variance in Election Polling: A Not-So-Hidden Markov Model,"With historic misses in the 2016 and 2020 US Presidential elections, interest
in measuring polling errors has increased. The most common method for measuring
directional errors and non-sampling excess variability during a postmortem for
an election is by assessing the difference between the poll result and election
result for polls conducted within a few days of the day of the election.
Analyzing such polling error data is notoriously difficult with typical models
being extremely sensitive to the time between the poll and the election. We
leverage hidden Markov models traditionally used for election forecasting to
flexibly capture time-varying preferences and treat the election result as a
peak at the typically hidden Markovian process. Our results are much less
sensitive to the choice of time window, avoid conflating shifting preferences
with polling error, and are more interpretable despite a highly flexible model.
We demonstrate these results with data on polls from the 2004 through 2020 US
Presidential elections, concluding that previously reported estimates of
pro-Democratic bias in 2016 and 2020 were too small, while excess variability
estimates were too large.",2206.14570v1,stat.AP,2022-06-16 19:21:02+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Graham Tierney'), arxiv.Result.Author('Alexander Volfovsky')]",

619,Mixed Polling with Rerouting and Applications,"Queueing systems with a single server in which customers wait to be served at
a finite number of distinct locations (buffers/queues) are called discrete
polling systems. Polling systems in which arrivals of users occur anywhere in a
continuum are called continuous polling systems. Often one encounters a
combination of the two systems: the users can either arrive in a continuum or
wait in a finite set (i.e. wait at a finite number of queues). We call these
systems mixed polling systems. Also, in some applications, customers are
rerouted to a new location (for another service) after their service is
completed. In this work, we study mixed polling systems with rerouting. We
obtain their steady state performance by discretization using the known pseudo
conservation laws of discrete polling systems. Their stationary expected
workload is obtained as a limit of the stationary expected workload of a
discrete system. The main tools for our analysis are: a) the fixed point
analysis of infinite dimensional operators and; b) the convergence of Riemann
sums to an integral.
  We analyze two applications using our results on mixed polling systems and
discuss the optimal system design. We consider a local area network, in which a
moving ferry facilitates communication (data transfer) using a wireless link.
We also consider a distributed waste collection system and derive the optimal
collection point. In both examples, the service requests can arrive anywhere in
a subset of the two dimensional plane. Namely, some users arrive in a
continuous set while others wait for their service in a finite set. The only
polling systems that can model these applications are mixed systems with
rerouting as introduced in this manuscript.",1309.1365v1,cs.PF,2013-09-05 14:50:33+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Veeraruna Kavitha'), arxiv.Result.Author('Richard Combes')]",
620,Limiting Risk by Turning Manifest Phantoms into Evil Zombies,"Drawing a random sample of ballots to conduct a risk-limiting audit generally
requires knowing how the ballots cast in an election are organized into groups,
for instance, how many containers of ballots there are in all and how many
ballots are in each container. A list of the ballot group identifiers along
with number of ballots in each group is called a ballot manifest. What if the
ballot manifest is not accurate? Surprisingly, even if ballots are known to be
missing from the manifest, it is not necessary to make worst-case assumptions
about those ballots--for instance, to adjust the margin by the number of
missing ballots--to ensure that the audit remains conservative. Rather, it
suffices to make worst-case assumptions about the individual randomly selected
ballots that the audit cannot find. This observation provides a simple
modification to some risk-limiting audit procedures that makes them
automatically become more conservative if the ballot manifest has errors. The
modification--phantoms to evil zombies (~2EZ)--requires only an upper bound on
the total number of ballots cast. ~2EZ makes the audit P-value stochastically
larger than it would be had the manifest been accurate, automatically requiring
more than enough ballots to be audited to offset the manifest errors. This
ensures that the true risk limit remains smaller than the nominal risk limit.
On the other hand, if the manifest is in fact accurate and the upper bound on
the total number of ballots equals the total according to the manifest, ~2EZ
has no effect at all on the number of ballots audited nor on the true risk
limit.",1207.3413v1,stat.AP,2012-07-14 11:26:02+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Jorge H. Banuelos'), arxiv.Result.Author('Philip B. Stark')]",

In this study, we altered votes on a voter's ballot after they had made their
selections on a BMD. We then required them to examine their ballots for any
changes from the slate they used to vote. Overall accuracy was exceptionally
high. Participants saw 1440 total contests, and of those 1440, there were a
total of 4 errors, so total accuracy was 99.8%. Participants were able to
perform with near-perfect accuracy regardless of ballot length, ballot type,
number of altered races, and location of altered races. Detection performance
was extremely robust. We conclude that with proper direction and resources,
voters can be near-perfect detectors of ballot changes on printed paper ballots
after voting with a BMD. This finding has significant implications for the
voting community as BMD use continues to grow. Research should now focus on
identifying administrative and behavioral methods that will prompt and

malevolent adversary trying to buy real ballots. If the citizenry is divided
into subgroups (or districts), the adversary can construct a so-called ""Devil's
Menu"" consisting of several prices. In equilibrium, the adversary can buy the
real ballots of any strict subset of districts at a price corresponding to the
willingness to sell on the part of the citizens holding such ballots. By
contrast, decoy voters are trapped into selling their ballots at a low, or even
negligible, price. Blowing up the adversary's budget by introducing decoy
ballots may thus turn out to be futile. The Devil's Menu can also be applied to
the well-known ""Lemons Problem"".",1712.05477v1,cs.GT,2017-12-14 23:54:58+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Hans Gersbach'), arxiv.Result.Author('Akaki Mamageishvili'), arxiv.Result.Author('Oriol Tejada')]",
625,The ATHENA Class of Risk-Limiting Ballot Polling Audits,"The main risk-limiting ballot polling audit in use today, BRAVO, is designed
for use when single ballots are drawn at random and a decision regarding
whether to stop the audit or draw another ballot is taken after each ballot
draw (ballot-by-ballot (B2) audits). On the other hand, real ballot polling
audits draw many ballots in a single round before determining whether to stop
(round-by-round (R2) audits). We show that BRAVO results in significant
inefficiency when directly applied to real R2 audits. We present the ATHENA
class of R2 stopping rules, which we show are risk-limiting if the round
schedule is pre-determined (before the audit begins). We prove that each rule
is at least as efficient as the corresponding BRAVO stopping rule applied at
the end of the round. We have open-source software libraries implementing most
of our results.
  We show that ATHENA halves the number of ballots required, for all state
margins in the 2016 US Presidential election and a first round with $90\%$
stopping probability, when compared to BRAVO (stopping rule applied at the end
of the round). We present simulation results supporting the 90% stopping
probability claims and our claims for the risk accrued in the first round.
Further, ATHENA reduces the number of ballots by more than a quarter for low
margins, when compared to the BRAVO stopping rule applied on ballots in
selection order. This implies that keeping track of the order when drawing
ballots R2 is not beneficial, because ATHENA is more efficient even without
information on selection order. These results are significant because current
approaches to real ballot polling election audits use the B2 BRAVO rules,
requiring about twice as much work on the part of election officials. Applying
the rules in selection order requires fewer ballots, but keeping track of the
order, and entering it into audit software, adds to the effort.",2008.02315v5,cs.CR,2020-08-05 18:47:37+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Filip Zagórski'), arxiv.Result.Author('Grant McClearn'), arxiv.Result.Author('Sarah Morin'), arxiv.Result.Author('Neal McBurnett'), arxiv.Result.Author('Poorvi L.

top. Unlike conventional methods of picking a ballot at random, $k$-cut does
not require identification numbers on the ballots or counting many ballots per
draw. We analyze how close the distribution of chosen ballots is to the uniform

sampling; (3) it can start in polling places on election night, before margins
are known. If the reported margins for the 2016 U.S. Presidential election are
correct, a Bernoulli ballot-polling audit with a risk limit of 5% and a
sampling rate of $p_0 = 1\%$ would have had at least a 99% probability of

which are bijective to symmetric Dyck tilings such as labeled trees, Hermite
histories, and perfect matchings. We also introduce two operations on labeled
trees for symmetric Dyck tilings: symmetric Dyck tiling strip (symDTS) and
symmetric Dyck tiling ribbon (symDTR). We give two definitions of Hermite
histories for symmetric Dyck tilings, and show that they are equivalent by use
of the correspondence between symDTS operation and an Hermite history. Since
ballot tilings form a subset in the set of symmetric Dyck tilings, we construct

629,SOBA: Secrecy-preserving Observable Ballot-level Audit,"SOBA is an approach to election verification that provides observers with
justifiably high confidence that the reported results of an election are
consistent with an audit trail (""ballots""), which can be paper or electronic.
SOBA combines three ideas: (1) publishing cast vote records (CVRs) separately
for each contest, so that anyone can verify that each reported contest outcome
is correct, if the CVRs reflect voters' intentions with sufficient accuracy;
(2) shrouding a mapping between ballots and the CVRs for those ballots to
prevent the loss of privacy that could occur otherwise; (3) assessing the
accuracy with which the CVRs reflect voters' intentions for a collection of
contests while simultaneously assessing the integrity of the shrouded mapping
between ballots and CVRs by comparing randomly selected ballots to the CVRs
that purport to represent them. Step (1) is related to work by the Humboldt
County Election Transparency Project, but publishing CVRs separately for
individual contests rather than images of entire ballots preserves privacy.
Step (2) requires a cryptographic commitment from elections officials.
Observers participate in step (3), which relies on the ""super-simple
simultaneous single-ballot risk-limiting audit."" Step (3) is designed to reveal
relatively few ballots if the shrouded mapping is proper and the CVRs
accurately reflect voter intent. But if the reported outcomes of the contests
differ from the outcomes that a full hand count would show, step (3) is
guaranteed to have a large chance of requiring all the ballots to be counted by
hand, thereby limiting the risk that an incorrect outcome will become official
and final.",1105.5803v2,stat.AP,2011-05-29 17:00:20+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Josh Benaloh'), arxiv.Result.Author('Douglas Jones'), arxiv.Result.Author('Eric Lazarus'), arxiv.Result.Author('Mark Lindeman'), arxiv.Result.Author('Philip B. Stark')]",
630,"Voter Verification of BMD Ballots Is a Two-Part Question: Can They? Mostly, They Can. Do They? Mostly, They Don't","The question of whether or not voters actually verify ballots produced by
ballot marking devices (BMDs) is presently the subject of some controversy.
Recent studies (e.g., Bernhard, et al. 2020) suggest the verification rate is
low. What is not clear from previous research is whether this is more a result
of voters being unable to do so accurately or whether this is because voters
simply choose not to attempt verification in the first place. In order to
understand this problem, we conducted an experiment in which 108 participants
participated in a mock election where the BMD displayed the voters' true
choices, but then changed a subset of those choices on the printed ballot. The
design of the printed ballot, the length of the ballot, the number of changes
that were made to the ballot, the location of those changes, and the
instructions provided to the voters were manipulated as part of the experiment.
Results indicated that of those voters who chose to examine the printed ballot,
76% detected anomalies, indicating that voters can reliably detect errors on
their ballot if they will simply review it. This suggests that administrative
remedies, rather than attempts to alter fundamental human perceptual
capabilities, could be employed to encourage voters to check their ballots,

Ballot-polling audits select ballots at random and interpret those ballots as

either they support the recorded result, or they fall back to a full manual
recount. For elections with digitised scanning and counting of ballots, a
comparison audit compares randomly selected digital ballots with their paper

evidence against or in support of the recorded result. Risk-limiting audits for
first-past-the-post elections are well understood, and used in some US
elections. We define a number of approaches to ballot-polling and comparison
risk-limiting audits for Instant Runoff Voting (IRV) elections. We show that
for almost all real elections we found, we can perform a risk-limiting audit by
looking at only a small fraction of the total ballots (assuming no errors were

traditional plurality voting in which voters submit rankings over the
candidates rather than single votes. In practice, elections using IRV often
restrict the ballot length, the number of candidates a voter is allowed to rank
on their ballot. We theoretically and empirically analyze how ballot length can
influence the outcome of an election, given fixed voter preferences. We show
that there exist preference profiles over $k$ candidates such that up to $k-1$
different candidates win at different ballot lengths. We derive exact lower
bounds on the number of voters required for such profiles and provide a
construction matching the lower bound for unrestricted voter preferences.
Additionally, we characterize which sequences of winners are possible over
ballot lengths and provide explicit profile constructions achieving any
feasible winner sequence. We also examine how classic preference restrictions
influence our results--for instance, single-peakedness makes $k-1$ different
winners impossible but still allows at least $\Omega(\sqrt k)$. Finally, we
analyze a collection of 168 real-world elections, where we truncate rankings to
simulate shorter ballots. We find that shorter ballots could have changed the
outcome in one quarter of these elections. Our results highlight ballot length
as a consequential degree of freedom in the design of IRV elections.",2207.08958v3,cs.MA,2022-07-18 22:01:13+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Kiran Tomlinson'), arxiv.Result.Author('Johan Ugander'), arxiv.Result.Author('Jon Kleinberg')]",

was committed by applying numerical maximums to machines in some precincts.
Equally, we discard any hypothesis that implies altering some machines and not
others, at each electoral precinct, because the variation patterns between
machines at each precinct are normal. However, the statistical evidence is
compatible with the occurrence of fraud that has affected every machine in a
single precinct, but differentially more in some precincts than others. We find
that the deviation pattern between precincts, based on the relationship between
the signatures collected to request the referendum in November 2003 (the
so-called, Reafirmazo), and the YES votes on August 15, is positive and
significantly correlated with the deviation pattern in the relationship between
exit polls and votes in those same precincts. In other words, those precincts

not be the rightful winner. Hand tallies of the votes in a random sample of
precincts can be used to test the hypothesis that a full manual recount would
find a different outcome. This paper develops a conservative sequential test
based on the vote-counting errors found in a hand tally of a simple or
stratified random sample of precincts. The procedure includes a natural
escalation: If the hypothesis that the apparent outcome is incorrect is not
rejected at stage $s$, more precincts are audited. Eventually, either the
hypothesis is rejected--and the apparent outcome is confirmed--or all precincts
have been audited and the true outcome is known. The test uses a priori bounds
on the overstatement of the margin that could result from error in each
precinct. Such bounds can be derived from the reported counts in each precinct
and upper bounds on the number of votes cast in each precinct. The test allows
errors in different precincts to be treated differently to reflect voting
technology or precinct sizes. It is not optimal, but it is conservative: the
chance of erroneously confirming the outcome of a contest if a full manual
recount would show a different outcome is no larger than the nominal
significance level. The approach also gives a conservative $P$-value for the
hypothesis that a full manual recount would find a different outcome, given the
errors found in a fixed size sample. This is illustrated with two contests from
November, 2006: the U.S. Senate race in Minnesota and a school board race for
the Sausalito Marin City School District in California, a small contest in

counts of Spanish national elections that took place in December 2015 and their
sequel in June 2016. Vote counts are extracted at the level of municipalities,
yielding an unusually high resolution dataset with over 8000 samples. We
initially consider the phenomenon of Bipartisanship breakdown by analysing
spatial distributions of several Bipartisanship indices. We find that such
breakdown is more prominent close to cosmopolite and largely populated areas
and less important in rural areas where Bipartisanship still prevails, and its
evolution mildly consolidates in the 2016 round, with some evidence of
Bipartisanship reinforcement which we hypothesize to be due to psychological
mechanisms of risk aversion. On a third step we explore to which extent vote
data are faithful by applying forensic techniques to vote statistics. We first
explore the conformance of first digit distributions to Benford's law for each
of the main political parties. The results and interpretations are mixed and
vary across different levels of aggregation, finding a general good
quantitative agreement at the national scale for both municipalities and
precincts but finding systematic nonconformance at the level of individual
precincts. As a complementary metric, we further explore the co-occurring
statistics of voteshare and turnout, finding a mild tendency in the clusters of
the conservative party to smear out towards the area of high turnout and
voteshare, what has been previously interpreted as a possible sign of
incremental fraud. In every case results are qualitatively similar between 2015

arrest rates. The standard GeoRDD relies on continuity assumptions of the
potential outcome surface or a local randomization assumption within a window
around the boundary. These assumptions, however, can easily be violated in
realistic applications. We develop a novel and robust approach to testing
whether there are differences in policing outcomes that are caused by
differences in police precincts across NYC. In particular, our test is robust
to violations of the assumptions traditionally made in GeoRDDs and is valid
under much weaker assumptions. We use a unique form of resampling to identify
new geographic boundaries that are known to have no treatment effect, which
provides a valid estimate of our test statistic's null distribution even under
violations of standard assumptions. This procedure gives substantially
different results in the analysis of NYC arrest rates than those that rely on
standard assumptions, thereby providing more robust tests of the effect of

determine a baseline for the expected distribution of partisan outcomes by
sampling an ensemble of maps. One approach to sampling is to use redistricting
policy as a guide to precisely codify preferences between maps. Such
preferences give rise to a probability distribution on the space of
redistricting plans, and Metropolis-Hastings methods allow one to sample
ensembles of maps from the specified distribution. Although these approaches
have nice theoretical properties and have successfully detected gerrymandering
in legal settings, sampling from commonly-used policy-driven distributions is
often computationally difficult. As of yet, there is no algorithm that can be
used off-the-shelf for checking maps under generic redistricting criteria. In

Republicans but do so with large marjorities. This skew accounts for persistent
Republican control of State Legislatures and Congressional seats even in some
states with statewide vote majorities for Democrats.
  Despite overall results showing Republican advantages in many states based on
mean results from simulations covering many random scenarios, the simulations
yield a wide range in metrics, suggesting bias can be minimized better by
selecting districting plans with low values for efficiency gap than by
selecting plans with values near the means for the ensemble of random
simulations.

the free will radius to its maximum value $1$, makes the representatives
totally independent. Moreover, we present a quantum circuit with which we
simulate in Qiskit the operation of the quantum parliament under various
scenarios. The experimental results allow to arrive at some novel and
fundamental conclusions that, we believe, provide new insights on the operation

the distribution of trackers is long-tailed with several highly dominant
trackers accounting for a large portion of the coverage. The extent of tracking

655,An Automated Approach to Auditing Disclosure of Third-Party Data Collection in Website Privacy Policies,"A dominant regulatory model for web privacy is ""notice and choice"". In this
model, users are notified of data collection and provided with options to
control it. To examine the efficacy of this approach, this study presents the
first large-scale audit of disclosure of third-party data collection in website
privacy policies. Data flows on one million websites are analyzed and over
200,000 websites' privacy policies are audited to determine if users are
notified of the names of the companies which collect their data. Policies from
25 prominent third-party data collectors are also examined to provide deeper
insights into the totality of the policy environment. Policies are additionally
audited to determine if the choice expressed by the ""Do Not Track"" browser
setting is respected.
  Third-party data collection is wide-spread, but fewer than 15% of attributed
data flows are disclosed. The third-parties most likely to be disclosed are
those with consumer services users may be aware of, those without consumer
services are less likely to be mentioned. Policies are difficult to understand
and the average time requirement to read both a given site{\guillemotright}s
policy and the associated third-party policies exceeds 84 minutes. Only 7% of
first-party site policies mention the Do Not Track signal, and the majority of
such mentions are to specify that the signal is ignored. Among third-party
policies examined, none offer unqualified support for the Do Not Track signal.
Findings indicate that current implementations of ""notice and choice"" fail to
provide notice or respect choice.",1805.01187v1,cs.CY,2018-05-03 09:40:58+00:00,[arxiv.Result.Author('Timothy Libert')],WWW '18 Proceedings of the 2018 World Wide Web Conference
656,Multi-party quantum private comparison of size relation with d-level single-particle states,"In this paper, by using d-level single-particle states, two novel multi-party
quantum private comparison protocols for size relation comparison with two
semi-honest third parties and one semi-honest third party are constructed,
respectively. Here, each protocol can compare the size relation of secret
integers from n parties rather than just the equality within one time
execution. In each protocol, every third party is assumed to be semi-honest in
the sense that she may misbehave on her own but is not allowed to collude with
anyone else; and each party employs the qudit shifting operation to encode her
secret integer. Each protocol can resist both the outside attack and the
participant attack. Specially, each party's secret integer can be kept unknown
to other parties and the third parties. The proposed protocol with two third
parties is workable in a stranger environment, as there are no communication
and no pre-shared key between each pair of party. The proposed protocol with
one third party is workable in an acquaintance environment, as all parties need
to share a common private key beforehand.",2205.06406v1,quant-ph,2022-05-13 00:34:52+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Chong-Qiang Ye'), arxiv.Result.Author('Tian-Yu Ye')]","Quantum Information Processing, 2018, 17(10):252"

messages on a shared blackboard that is visible to every party. We show that
any non-trivial graph problem on $n$-vertex graphs has blackboard communication
complexity $\Omega(n)$ bits, even if the edges of the input graph are randomly
assigned to the $k$ parties. We say that a graph problem is non-trivial if the
output cannot be computed in a model where every party holds at most one edge
and no communication is allowed. Our lower bound thus holds for essentially all
key graph problems relevant to distributed computing, including Maximal
Independent Set (MIS), Maximal Matching, ($\Delta+1$)-coloring, and Dominating
Set. In many cases, e.g., MIS, Maximal Matching, and $(\Delta+1)$-coloring, our

659,Using Deep Learning and Google Street View to Estimate the Demographic Makeup of the US,"The United States spends more than $1B each year on initiatives such as the
American Community Survey (ACS), a labor-intensive door-to-door study that
measures statistics relating to race, gender, education, occupation,
unemployment, and other demographic factors. Although a comprehensive source of
data, the lag between demographic changes and their appearance in the ACS can
exceed half a decade. As digital imagery becomes ubiquitous and machine vision
techniques improve, automated data analysis may provide a cheaper and faster
alternative. Here, we present a method that determines socioeconomic trends
from 50 million images of street scenes, gathered in 200 American cities by
Google Street View cars. Using deep learning-based computer vision techniques,
we determined the make, model, and year of all motor vehicles encountered in
particular neighborhoods. Data from this census of motor vehicles, which
enumerated 22M automobiles in total (8% of all automobiles in the US), was used
to accurately estimate income, race, education, and voting patterns, with
single-precinct resolution. (The average US precinct contains approximately
1000 people.) The resulting associations are surprisingly simple and powerful.
For instance, if the number of sedans encountered during a 15-minute drive
through a city is higher than the number of pickup trucks, the city is likely
to vote for a Democrat during the next Presidential election (88% chance);
otherwise, it is likely to vote Republican (82%). Our results suggest that
automated systems for monitoring demographic trends may effectively complement
labor-intensive approaches, with the potential to detect trends with fine

660,Limiting Risk by Turning Manifest Phantoms into Evil Zombies,"Drawing a random sample of ballots to conduct a risk-limiting audit generally
requires knowing how the ballots cast in an election are organized into groups,
for instance, how many containers of ballots there are in all and how many
ballots are in each container. A list of the ballot group identifiers along
with number of ballots in each group is called a ballot manifest. What if the
ballot manifest is not accurate? Surprisingly, even if ballots are known to be
missing from the manifest, it is not necessary to make worst-case assumptions
about those ballots--for instance, to adjust the margin by the number of
missing ballots--to ensure that the audit remains conservative. Rather, it
suffices to make worst-case assumptions about the individual randomly selected
ballots that the audit cannot find. This observation provides a simple
modification to some risk-limiting audit procedures that makes them
automatically become more conservative if the ballot manifest has errors. The
modification--phantoms to evil zombies (~2EZ)--requires only an upper bound on
the total number of ballots cast. ~2EZ makes the audit P-value stochastically
larger than it would be had the manifest been accurate, automatically requiring
more than enough ballots to be audited to offset the manifest errors. This
ensures that the true risk limit remains smaller than the nominal risk limit.
On the other hand, if the manifest is in fact accurate and the upper bound on
the total number of ballots equals the total according to the manifest, ~2EZ
has no effect at all on the number of ballots audited nor on the true risk
limit.",1207.3413v1,stat.AP,2012-07-14 11:26:02+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Jorge H. Banuelos'), arxiv.Result.Author('Philip B. Stark')]",

selections on a BMD. We then required them to examine their ballots for any
changes from the slate they used to vote. Overall accuracy was exceptionally
high. Participants saw 1440 total contests, and of those 1440, there were a
total of 4 errors, so total accuracy was 99.8%. Participants were able to
perform with near-perfect accuracy regardless of ballot length, ballot type,
number of altered races, and location of altered races. Detection performance
was extremely robust. We conclude that with proper direction and resources,
voters can be near-perfect detectors of ballot changes on printed paper ballots
after voting with a BMD. This finding has significant implications for the
voting community as BMD use continues to grow. Research should now focus on

real ballots of any strict subset of districts at a price corresponding to the
willingness to sell on the part of the citizens holding such ballots. By
contrast, decoy voters are trapped into selling their ballots at a low, or even
negligible, price. Blowing up the adversary's budget by introducing decoy
ballots may thus turn out to be futile. The Devil's Menu can also be applied to

667,The ATHENA Class of Risk-Limiting Ballot Polling Audits,"The main risk-limiting ballot polling audit in use today, BRAVO, is designed
for use when single ballots are drawn at random and a decision regarding
whether to stop the audit or draw another ballot is taken after each ballot
draw (ballot-by-ballot (B2) audits). On the other hand, real ballot polling
audits draw many ballots in a single round before determining whether to stop
(round-by-round (R2) audits). We show that BRAVO results in significant
inefficiency when directly applied to real R2 audits. We present the ATHENA
class of R2 stopping rules, which we show are risk-limiting if the round
schedule is pre-determined (before the audit begins). We prove that each rule
is at least as efficient as the corresponding BRAVO stopping rule applied at
the end of the round. We have open-source software libraries implementing most
of our results.
  We show that ATHENA halves the number of ballots required, for all state
margins in the 2016 US Presidential election and a first round with $90\%$
stopping probability, when compared to BRAVO (stopping rule applied at the end
of the round). We present simulation results supporting the 90% stopping
probability claims and our claims for the risk accrued in the first round.
Further, ATHENA reduces the number of ballots by more than a quarter for low
margins, when compared to the BRAVO stopping rule applied on ballots in
selection order. This implies that keeping track of the order when drawing
ballots R2 is not beneficial, because ATHENA is more efficient even without
information on selection order. These results are significant because current
approaches to real ballot polling election audits use the B2 BRAVO rules,
requiring about twice as much work on the part of election officials. Applying
the rules in selection order requires fewer ballots, but keeping track of the
order, and entering it into audit software, adds to the effort.",2008.02315v5,cs.CR,2020-08-05 18:47:37+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Filip Zagórski'), arxiv.Result.Author('Grant McClearn'), arxiv.Result.Author('Sarah Morin'), arxiv.Result.Author('Neal McBurnett'), arxiv.Result.Author('Poorvi L.

ballots from the top to the bottom of the stack, and then picking the ballot on
top. Unlike conventional methods of picking a ballot at random, $k$-cut does
not require identification numbers on the ballots or counting many ballots per
draw. We analyze how close the distribution of chosen ballots is to the uniform

sampling; (3) it can start in polling places on election night, before margins
are known. If the reported margins for the 2016 U.S. Presidential election are
correct, a Bernoulli ballot-polling audit with a risk limit of 5% and a
sampling rate of $p_0 = 1\%$ would have had at least a 99% probability of

SOBA combines three ideas: (1) publishing cast vote records (CVRs) separately
for each contest, so that anyone can verify that each reported contest outcome
is correct, if the CVRs reflect voters' intentions with sufficient accuracy;
(2) shrouding a mapping between ballots and the CVRs for those ballots to
prevent the loss of privacy that could occur otherwise; (3) assessing the
accuracy with which the CVRs reflect voters' intentions for a collection of
contests while simultaneously assessing the integrity of the shrouded mapping
between ballots and CVRs by comparing randomly selected ballots to the CVRs
that purport to represent them. Step (1) is related to work by the Humboldt
County Election Transparency Project, but publishing CVRs separately for
individual contests rather than images of entire ballots preserves privacy.
Step (2) requires a cryptographic commitment from elections officials.

relatively few ballots if the shrouded mapping is proper and the CVRs
accurately reflect voter intent. But if the reported outcomes of the contests

simply choose not to attempt verification in the first place. In order to
understand this problem, we conducted an experiment in which 108 participants
participated in a mock election where the BMD displayed the voters' true
choices, but then changed a subset of those choices on the printed ballot. The
design of the printed ballot, the length of the ballot, the number of changes

instructions provided to the voters were manipulated as part of the experiment.
Results indicated that of those voters who chose to examine the printed ballot,

influence the outcome of an election, given fixed voter preferences. We show
that there exist preference profiles over $k$ candidates such that up to $k-1$
different candidates win at different ballot lengths. We derive exact lower
bounds on the number of voters required for such profiles and provide a
construction matching the lower bound for unrestricted voter preferences.
Additionally, we characterize which sequences of winners are possible over

680,FASTEN: Fair and Secure Distributed Voting Using Smart Contracts,"Electing democratic representatives via voting has been a common mechanism
since the 17th century. However, these mechanisms raise concerns about
fairness, privacy, vote concealment, fair calculations of tally, and proxies
voting on their behalf for the voters. Ballot voting, and in recent times,
electronic voting via electronic voting machines (EVMs) improves fairness by
relying on centralized trust. Homomorphic encryption-based voting protocols
also assure fairness but cannot scale to large scale elections such as
presidential elections. In this paper, we leverage the blockchain technology of
distributing trust to propose a smart contract-based protocol, namely, \proto.
There are many existing protocols for voting using smart contracts. We observe
that these either are not scalable or leak the vote tally during the voting
stage, i.e., do not provide vote concealment. In contrast, we show that FASTEN
preserves voter's privacy ensures vote concealment, immutability, and avoids
double voting. We prove that the probability of privacy breaches is negligibly
small. Further, our cost analysis of executing FASTEN over Ethereum is
comparable to most of the existing cost of elections.",2102.10594v1,cs.CR,2021-02-21 12:29:23+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Sankarshan Damle'), arxiv.Result.Author('Sujit Gujar'), arxiv.Result.Author('Moin Hussain Moti')]",

which the optimal quota can be estimated analytically as a function of the

and total number of user votes for films are consistent with double-log normal
distributions for certain time periods. Both total gross and user votes are
consistent with a double-log normal distribution from the late 1980s onward,
while for budget, it extends from 1935 to 1979. In addition, we find a strong
correlation between number of user votes and the economic statistics,
particularly budget. Remarkably, we find no evidence for a correlation between
number of votes and average user rating. As previous studies have found a

swapping the positions of two consecutive candidates in their preference order,
and for perturbing their approval count to favour candidates.

candidates. The Candidates are classified into two categories $\mu\in \{0,1\}$
and are called as `binary' candidates. There are in total $N=N_{0}+N_{1}$
candidates, and voters vote for them one by one. The probability that a
candidate gets a vote is proportional to the number of votes. The initial
number of votes (`seed') of a candidate $\mu$ is set to be $s_{\mu}$. After
infinite counts of voting, the probability function of the share of votes of
the candidate $\mu$ obeys gamma distributions with the shape exponent $s_{\mu}$
in the thermodynamic limit $Z_{0}=N_{1}s_{1}+N_{0}s_{0}\to \infty$. Between the
cumulative functions $\{x_{\mu}\}$ of binary candidates, the power-law relation
$1-x_{1} \sim (1-x_{0})^{\alpha}$ with the critical exponent
$\alpha=s_{1}/s_{0}$ holds in the region $1-x_{0},1-x_{1}<<1$. In the double
scaling limit $(s_{1},s_{0})\to (0,0)$ and $Z_{0} \to \infty$ with
$s_{1}/s_{0}=\alpha$ fixed, the relation $1-x_{1}=(1-x_{0})^{\alpha}$ holds

are non-monotonic with respect to voting weights, and that some member states

non-monotonicity is in most cases inherent in the double-majority system, but
is strongly exacerbated by the peculiarities of the EU population vector.
Furthermore, we investigate consequences of a hypothetical ""generalized

racehorses are mixed on the win bet fraction axis. We see the emergence of a
scale invariant relation between the cumulative distribution function of the
winning horse $x_{1}$ and that of the losing horse $x_{0}$. $x_{1}\propto
x_{0}^{\alpha}$ holds in the small win bet fraction region. We also see the
efficiency of the market as the vote proceeds. However, the convergence to the
efficient state is not monotonic. The time change of the distribution of a vote
is complicated. Votes resume concentration on popular horses, after the
distribution spreads to a certain extent. In order to explain scale invariance,
we introduce a simple voting model. In a `double' scaling limit, we show that

Previously, participants had to trust third parties, run expensive
cryptographic protocols or sacrifice anonymity. In this paper, we propose a
resilient-optimal solution to this problem called AVCP, which tolerates up to a
third of Byzantine participants. AVCP combines traceable ring signatures to
detect double votes with a reduction from vector consensus to binary consensus
to ensure all valid votes are taken into account. We prove our algorithm
correct and show that it preserves anonymity with at most a linear
communication overhead and constant message overhead when compared to a recent

688,"Dimensionality, Coordination, and Robustness in Voting","We study the performance of voting mechanisms from a utilitarian standpoint,
under the recently introduced framework of metric-distortion, offering new
insights along three main lines. First, if $d$ represents the doubling
dimension of the metric space, we show that the distortion of STV is $O(d \log
\log m)$, where $m$ represents the number of candidates. For doubling metrics
this implies an exponential improvement over the lower bound for general
metrics, and as a special case it effectively answers a question left open by
Skowron and Elkind (AAAI '17) regarding the distortion of STV under
low-dimensional Euclidean spaces. More broadly, this constitutes the first
nexus between the performance of any voting rule and the ""intrinsic
dimensionality"" of the underlying metric space. We also establish a
nearly-matching lower bound, refining the construction of Skowron and Elkind.
Moreover, motivated by the efficiency of STV, we investigate whether natural
learning rules can lead to low-distortion outcomes. Specifically, we introduce
simple, deterministic and decentralized exploration/exploitation dynamics, and
we show that they converge to a candidate with $O(1)$ distortion. Finally,
driven by applications in facility location games, we consider several
refinements and extensions of the standard metric-setting. Namely, we prove
that the deterministic mechanism recently introduced by Gkatzelis, Halpern, and
Shah (FOCS '20) attains the optimal distortion bound of $2$ under
ultra-metrics, while it also comes close to our lower bound under distances

For having a reliable blockchain and double-spending prevention, we need a

for transactions confirmation, this consensus mechanism is vulnerable against
double-spending. On the other hand, PoW consumes a significant amount of energy
that by growing the network, it becomes a major problematic of this consensus
mechanism. In this paper, we introduce an alternative to PoW, because of all
its major problems and security issues that may lead to collapsing
decentralization of the blockchain, while a full decentralized system is the
main purpose of using blockchain technology. The approach we introduce is based

the voting method. A growing body of literature explores strategic voting when
there is uncertainty about how others will vote. In this paper, we study
strategic voting when there is uncertainty about the voting method. We
introduce three notions of manipulability for a set of voting methods: sure,
safe, and expected manipulability. With the help of a computer program, we
identify voting scenarios in which uncertainty about the voting method may
reduce or even eliminate a voter's incentive to misrepresent her preferences.
Thus, it may be in the interest of an election designer who wishes to reduce
strategic voting to leave voters uncertain about which of several reasonable
voting methods will be used to determine the winners of an election.",1907.09110v1,cs.MA,2019-07-22 03:17:19+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Wesley H. Holliday'), arxiv.Result.Author('Eric Pacuit')]","EPTCS 297, 2019, pp. 252-272"

agents since voting is costly. Misbehaving agents always vote. We compare
conventional voting allowing for abstention with vote delegation. Preferences
of voters are private information and a positive outcome is achieved if
well-behaving agents win. We illustrate that vote delegation leads to quite
different outcomes than conventional voting with abstention. In particular, we
obtain three insights: First, if the number of misbehaving voters, denoted by f
, is high, both voting methods fail to deliver a positive outcome. Second, if f
takes an intermediate value, conventional voting delivers a positive outcome,
while vote delegation fails with probability one. Third, if f is low,
delegation delivers a positive outcome with higher probability than
conventional voting. Finally, our results characterize worst-case outcomes that

on the tournament graph (like Copeland) respectively. We argue that with an
elimination style voting rule like single transferable vote, partial voting
does not change the situations where strategic voting is possible. However,
with scoring rules and rules based on the tournament graph, partial voting can
increase the situations where strategic voting is possible. As a consequence,
the computational complexity of computing a strategic vote can change. For
example, with Borda count, the complexity of computing a strategic vote can
decrease or stay the same depending on how we score partial votes.",1405.7714v1,cs.GT,2014-05-28 12:13:52+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Nina Narodytska'), arxiv.Result.Author('Toby Walsh')]",

voting rules are expressed as axioms to be satisfied. This thesis focuses on
axioms concerning strategic manipulation by voters. Sometimes, voters may
intentionally misstate their true preferences in order to alter the outcome for
their own advantage. For example, in plurality rule, if a voter knows that
their top-choice candidate will lose, then they might instead vote for their
second-choice candidate just to avoid an even less desirable result. When no
coalition of voters can strategically manipulate, then the voting rule is said
to satisfy the axiom of Strategy-Proofness. A less restrictive axiom is Weak
Strategy-Proofness (as defined by Dasgupta and Maskin (2019)), which allows for
strategic manipulation by all but the smallest coalitions. Under certain
intuitive conditions, Dasgupta and Maskin (2019) proved that the only voting
rules satisfying Strategy-Proofness are rank-order voting and majority rule. In

upon a special case of the \maxp fundamental solution, first proposed in
\cite{FlemMac}. Such fundamental solution can extend a special solution of
certain bivariate DRE into the general solution, and can analytically solve the
DRE starting from any initial condition.
  This paper also shows that under a fixed duality kernel, the semiconvex dual
of a DRE solution satisfies another dual DRE, whose coefficients satisfy the
matrix compatibility conditions involving Hamiltonian and certain symplectic
matrices. For the time invariant DRE, this allows us to make dual DRE linear
and thereby solve the primal DRE analytically. This paper also derives various
kernel/duality relationships between the primal and time shifted dual DREs,
which leads to an array of DRE solutions. Time invariant analogue of one of
these methods was first proposed in \cite{Funda}.",0903.0405v3,math.OC,2009-03-02 23:00:59+00:00,[arxiv.Result.Author('Ameet Deshpande')],
704,Deep Recurrent Encoder: A scalable end-to-end network to model brain signals,"Understanding how the brain responds to sensory inputs is challenging: brain
recordings are partial, noisy, and high dimensional; they vary across sessions
and subjects and they capture highly nonlinear dynamics. These challenges have
led the community to develop a variety of preprocessing and analytical (almost
exclusively linear) methods, each designed to tackle one of these issues.
Instead, we propose to address these challenges through a specific end-to-end
deep learning architecture, trained to predict the brain responses of multiple
subjects at once. We successfully test this approach on a large cohort of
magnetoencephalography (MEG) recordings acquired during a one-hour reading
task. Our Deep Recurrent Encoding (DRE) architecture reliably predicts MEG
responses to words with a three-fold improvement over classic linear methods.
To overcome the notorious issue of interpretability of deep learning, we
describe a simple variable importance analysis. When applied to DRE, this
method recovers the expected evoked responses to word length and word
frequency. The quantitative improvement of the present deep learning approach
paves the way to better understand the nonlinear dynamics of brain activity
from large datasets.",2103.02339v3,q-bio.NC,2021-03-03 11:39:17+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Omar Chehab'), arxiv.Result.Author('Alexandre Defossez'), arxiv.Result.Author('Jean-Christophe Loiseau'), arxiv.Result.Author('Alexandre Gramfort'), arxiv.Result.Author('Jean-Remi King')]",

extensively studied. However, BD minimization when applied with highly flexible
models, such as deep neural networks, tends to suffer from what we call
train-loss hacking, which is a source of overfitting caused by a typical
characteristic of empirical BD estimators. In this paper, to mitigate
train-loss hacking, we propose a non-negative correction for empirical BD
estimators. Theoretically, we confirm the soundness of the proposed method

evidence before, we first harvested a large corpus of real data from the Web

of our work is that the data set is sufficiently large compared with previous
work, which is obtained using several data collection strategies we proposed.
The results show more than 98\% of expressions in Relax NG are DRE, and more
than 56\% of expressions from RegExLib are DRE, while both Relax NG and
RegExLib do not have the determinism constraint. These observations indicate
that DREs are commonly used in practice. The results also show further study of
subclasses of DREs is necessary. As far as we know, we are the first to analyze
the determinism and the subclasses of DREs of Relax NG and RegExLib, and give
these results. Furthermore, we give some discussions and applications of the
data set. We obtain a DRE data set from the original data, which will be useful
in practice and it has value in its own right. We find current research in new

714,Stochastic Dynamic Optimal Power Flow in Distribution Network with Distributed Renewable Energy and Battery Energy Storage,"The penetration of distributed renewable energy (DRE) greatly raises the risk
of distribution network operation such as peak shaving and voltage stability.
Battery energy storage (BES) has been widely accepted as the most potential
application to cope with the challenge of high penetration of DRE. To cope with
the uncertainties and variability of DRE, a stochastic day-ahead dynamic
optimal power flow (DOPF) and its algorithm are proposed. The overall economy
is achieved by fully considering the DRE, BES, electricity purchasing and
active power losses. The rainflow algorithm-based cycle counting method of BES
is incorporated in the DOPF model to capture the cell degradation, greatly
extending the expected BES lifetime and achieving a better economy. DRE
scenarios are generated to consider the uncertainties and correlations based on
the Copula theory. To solve the DOPF model, we propose a Lagrange
relaxation-based algorithm, which has a significantly reduced complexity with
respect to the existing techniques. For this reason, the proposed algorithm
enables much more scenarios incorporated in the DOPF model and better captures
the DRE uncertainties and correlations. Finally, numerical studies for the
day-ahead DOPF in the IEEE 123-node test feeder are presented to demonstrate
the merits of the proposed method. Results show that the actual BES life

experimental practices for public EHR benchmarks (such as the MIMIC-III
critical care dataset) are time agnostic, assigning care records to train or
test sets without regard for the actual dates of care. As a result, current
benchmarks cannot assess how well models trained on one year generalise to

boundary layer thickness are found to be strongly correlated with the
near-surface temperature gradient. The correlation confirms a median thickness

724,MedKnowts: Unified Documentation and Information Retrieval for Electronic Health Records,"Clinical documentation can be transformed by Electronic Health Records, yet
the documentation process is still a tedious, time-consuming, and error-prone
process. Clinicians are faced with multi-faceted requirements and fragmented
interfaces for information exploration and documentation. These challenges are
only exacerbated in the Emergency Department -- clinicians often see 35
patients in one shift, during which they have to synthesize an often previously
unknown patient's medical records in order to reach a tailored diagnosis and
treatment plan. To better support this information synthesis, clinical
documentation tools must enable rapid contextual access to the patient's
medical record. MedKnowts is an integrated note-taking editor and information
retrieval system which unifies the documentation and search process and
provides concise synthesized concept-oriented slices of the patient's medical
record. MedKnowts automatically captures structured data while still allowing

relaxation process known as aging. To explain its commonality and the
astounding insensitivity to most microscopic details, record dynamics (RD)
posits that a small set of increasingly rare and irreversible events, so called
quakes, controls the dynamics. While key predictions of RD are known to concur
with a number of experimental and simulational results, its basic assumption on
the nature of quake statistics has proven extremely difficult to verify
experimentally. The careful distinction of rare (""record"") cage-breaking events
from in-cage rattle accomplished in previous experiments on jammed colloids,
enables us to extract the first direct experimental evidence for the
fundamental hypothesis of RD that the rate of quakes decelerates with the
inverse of the system age. The resulting description shows the predicted growth

identify drug effects for each patient, understand the relationship between
genotypes and phenotypes, explore new phenotypes or treatment recommendations,

traditional models, recent artificial intelligence approaches do not require
domain-specific data pre-processing, and it is expected that it will ultimately

727,Feature Robustness in Non-stationary Health Records: Caveats to Deployable Model Performance in Common Clinical Machine Learning Tasks,"When training clinical prediction models from electronic health records
(EHRs), a key concern should be a model's ability to sustain performance over
time when deployed, even as care practices, database systems, and population
demographics evolve. Due to de-identification requirements, however, current
experimental practices for public EHR benchmarks (such as the MIMIC-III
critical care dataset) are time agnostic, assigning care records to train or
test sets without regard for the actual dates of care. As a result, current
benchmarks cannot assess how well models trained on one year generalise to
another. In this work, we obtain a Limited Data Use Agreement to access year of
care for each record in MIMIC and show that all tested state-of-the-art models
decay in prediction quality when trained on historical data and tested on
future data, particularly in response to a system-wide record-keeping change in
2008 (0.29 drop in AUROC for mortality prediction, 0.10 drop in AUROC for
length-of-stay prediction with a random forest classifier). We further develop
a simple yet effective mitigation strategy: by aggregating raw features into
expert-defined clinical concepts, we see only a 0.06 drop in AUROC for
mortality prediction and a 0.03 drop in AUROC for length-of-stay prediction. We
demonstrate that this aggregation strategy outperforms other automatic feature
preprocessing techniques aimed at increasing robustness to data drift. We
release our aggregated representations and code to encourage more deployable

729,Joint Stabilization and Direction of 360°Videos,"360{\deg} video provides an immersive experience for viewers, allowing them
to freely explore the world by turning their head. However, creating
high-quality 360{\deg} video content can be challenging, as viewers may miss
important events by looking in the wrong direction, or they may see things that
ruin the immersion, such as stitching artifacts and the film crew. We take
advantage of the fact that not all directions are equally likely to be
observed; most viewers are more likely to see content located at ``true
north'', i.e. in front of them, due to ergonomic constraints. We therefore
propose 360{\deg} video direction, where the video is jointly optimized to
orient important events to the front of the viewer and visual clutter behind
them, while producing smooth camera motion. Unlike traditional video, viewers
can still explore the space as desired, but with the knowledge that the most
important content is likely to be in front of them. Constraints can be user
guided, either added directly on the equirectangular projection or by recording
``guidance'' viewing directions while watching the video in a VR headset, or
automatically computed, such as via visual saliency or forward motion
direction. To accomplish this, we propose a new motion estimation technique
specifically designed for 360{\deg} video which outperforms the commonly used
5-point algorithm on wide angle video. We additionally formulate the direction
problem as an optimization where a novel parametrization of spherical warping
allows us to correct for some degree of parallax effects. We compare our
approach to recent methods that address stabilization-only and converting
360{\deg} video to narrow field-of-view video.",1901.04161v1,cs.GR,2019-01-14 07:13:46+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Chengzhou Tang'), arxiv.Result.Author('Oliver Wang'), arxiv.Result.Author('Feng Liu'), arxiv.Result.Author('Ping Tan')]",

733,Clinical Productivity System - A Decision Support Model,"Purpose: This goal of this study was to evaluate the effects of a data-driven
clinical productivity system that leverages Electronic Health Record (EHR) data
to provide productivity decision support functionality in a real-world clinical
setting. The system was implemented for a large behavioral health care provider
seeing over 75,000 distinct clients a year. Design/methodology/approach: The
key metric in this system is a ""VPU"", which simultaneously optimizes multiple
aspects of clinical care. The resulting mathematical value of clinical
productivity was hypothesized to tightly link the organization's performance to
its expectations and, through transparency and decision support tools at the
clinician level, affect significant changes in productivity, quality, and
consistency relative to traditional models of clinical productivity. Findings:
In only 3 months, every single variable integrated into the VPU system showed
significant improvement, including a 30% rise in revenue, 10% rise in clinical
percentage, a 25% rise in treatment plan completion, a 20% rise in case rate
eligibility, along with similar improvements in compliance/audit issues,
outcomes collection, access, etc. Practical implications: A data-driven
clinical productivity system employing decision support functionality is
effective because of the impact on clinician behavior relative to traditional
clinical productivity systems. Critically, the model is also extensible to
integration with outcomes-based productivity. Originality/Value: EHR's are only
a first step - the problem is turning that data into useful information.
Technology can leverage the data in order to produce actionable information
that can inform clinical practice and decision-making. Without additional
technology, EHR's are essentially just copies of paper-based records stored in

We then discuss how bottlenecks of blockchains can be relieved with sidechains,

735,A Transit of Venus Possibly Misinterpreted as an Unaided-Eye Sunspot Observation in China on 9 December 1874,"Large sunspots can be observed with the unaided eye under suitable
atmospheric seeing conditions. Such observations are of particular value
because the frequency of their appearance provides an approximate indication of
the prevailing level of solar activity. Unaided-eye sunspot (UES) observations
can be traced back well before the start of telescopic observations of the Sun,
especially in the East Asian historical records. It is therefore important to
compare more modern, UES observations with the results of telescopic sunspot
observations, to gain a better understanding of the nature of the UES records.
A previous comparison of Chinese UES records and Greenwich photo-heliographic
results between 1874 and 1918 indicated that a few of the UES were apparently
not supported by direct photographic evidence of at least one sunspot with a
large area. This article reveals that one of the Chinese unaided-eye
observations had possibly captured the transit of Venus on 9 December 1874. The
Chinese sunspot records on this date are compared with Western sunspot
observations on the same day. It is concluded that sunspots on the solar disk
were quite small and the transit of Venus was probably misinterpreted as a
sunspot by the Chinese local scholars. This case indicates that sunspots or
comparable ""obscuring"" objects with an area as large as 1000 millionths of the
solar disk could easily have been seen with the unaided eye under suitable
seeing conditions. It also confirms the visibility of sunspots near the solar
limb with the unaided eye. This study provides an explanation of the apparent
discrepancy between the Chinese UES observation on 9 December 1874 and the
Western sunspot observations using telescopes, as well as a basis for further
discussion on the negative pairs in 1900 and 1911, apparently without

so that it sounds as if it was recorded in the same room as a reference
recording, with applications both in audio post-production and augmented
reality. In this work, we propose FiNS, a Filtered Noise Shaping network that
directly estimates the time domain room impulse response (RIR) from reverberant
speech. Our domain-inspired architecture features a time domain encoder and a
filtered noise shaping decoder that models the RIR as a summation of decaying
filtered noise signals, along with direct sound and early reflection
components. Previous methods for acoustic matching utilize either large models
to transform audio to match the target room or predict parameters for
algorithmic reverberators. Instead, blind estimation of the RIR enables
efficient and realistic transformation with a single convolution. An evaluation
demonstrates our model not only synthesizes RIRs that match parameters of the
target room, such as the $T_{60}$ and DRR, but also more accurately reproduces
perceptual characteristics of the target room, as shown in a listening test

not sufficient to reconstruct see-saw, a feature which we refer to as ``see-saw
degeneracy''. Indirect tests of see-saw are leptogenesis and lepton flavor
violation in supersymmetric scenarios, which together with neutrino mass and
mixing define the framework of see-saw phenomenology. Several examples are
given, both phenomenological and GUT-related. Variants of the see-saw mechanism
like the type II or triplet see-saw are also discussed. In particular, we
compare many general aspects regarding the dependence of LFV on low energy
neutrino parameters in the extreme cases of a dominating conventional see-saw
term or a dominating triplet term. For instance, the absence of mu -> e gamma
or tau -> e gamma in the pure triplet case means that CP is conserved in
neutrino oscillations. Scanning models, we also find that among the decays mu
-> e gamma, tau -> e gamma and tau -> mu gamma the latter one has the largest

period of calm upper atmosphere with a stable free-atmosphere seeing of 0.2-0.3
arcseconds was noted. A gain in resolution from adaptive compensation of ground
layer will be 1.7 times typically and 2-3 times during such calm periods.
Correlations of the free-atmosphere turbulence with the wind speed at
tropopause and of the ground-layer turbulence with ground wind are studied.

748,A Machine Learning Approach to Correcting Atmospheric Seeing in Solar Flare Observations,"Current post-processing techniques for the correction of atmospheric seeing
in solar observations -- such as Speckle interferometry and Phase Diversity
methods -- have limitations when it comes to their reconstructive capabilities
of solar flare observations. This, combined with the sporadic nature of flares
meaning observers cannot wait until seeing conditions are optimal before taking
measurements, means that many ground-based solar flare observations are marred
with bad seeing. To combat this, we propose a method for dedicated flare seeing
correction based on training a deep neural network to learn to correct
artificial seeing from flare observations taken during good seeing conditions.
This model uses transfer learning, a novel technique in solar physics, to help
learn these corrections. Transfer learning is when another network already
trained on similar data is used to influence the learning of the new network.
Once trained, the model has been applied to two flare datasets: one from
AR12157 on 2014/09/06 and one from AR12673 on 2017/09/06. The results show good
corrections to images with bad seeing with a relative error assigned to the
estimate based on the performance of the model. Further discussion takes place
of improvements to the robustness of the error on these estimates.",2011.12814v1,astro-ph.SR,2020-11-25 15:17:26+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('John A. Armstrong'), arxiv.Result.Author('Lyndsay Fletcher')]",

751,Typical duration of good seeing sequences at Concordia,"Context: The winter seeing at Concordia is essentially bimodal, excellent or
quite poor, with relative proportions that depend on altitude above the snow
surface. This paper studies the temporal behavior of the good seeing sequences.
Aims: An efficient exploitation of extremely good seeing with an adaptive
optics system needs long integrations. It is then important to explore the
temporal distribution of the fraction of time providing excellent seeing.
Methods: Temporal windows of good seeing are created by a simple binary
process. Good or bad. Their autocorrelations are corrected for those of the
existing data sets, since these are not continuous, being often interrupted by
technical problems in addition to the adverse weather gaps. At the end these
corrected autocorrelations provide the typical duration of good seeing
sequences. This study has to be a little detailed as its results depend on the
season, summer or winter. Results: Using a threshold of 0.5 arcsec to define
the ""good seeing"", three characteristic numbers are found to describe the
temporal evolution of the good seeing windows. The first number is the mean
duration of an uninterrupted good seeing sequence: it is $\tau_0=7.5$ hours at
8 m above the ground (15 hours at 20 m). These sequences are randomly
distributed in time, with a negative exponential law of damping time
$\tau_1=29$ hours (at elevation 8 m and 20 m). The third number is the mean

752,Excellent daytime seeing at Dome Fuji on the Antarctic plateau,"Context. Dome Fuji, the second highest region on the Antarctic plateau, is
expected to have some of the best astronomical seeing on Earth. However, site
testing at Dome Fuji is still in its very early stages.
  Aims. To investigate the astronomical seeing in the free atmosphere above
Dome Fuji, and to determine the height of the surface boundary layer.
  Methods. A Differential Image Motion Monitor was used to measure the seeing
in the visible (472 nm) at a height of 11 m above the snow surface at Dome Fuji
during the austral summer of 2012/2013.
  Results. Seeing below 0.2'' has been observed. The seeing often has a local
minimum of ~0.3'' near 18 h local time. Some periods of excellent seeing, 0.3''
or smaller, were also observed, sometimes extending for several hours at local
midnight. The median seeing is higher, at 0.52''---this large value is believed
to be caused by periods when the telescope was within the turbulent boundary
layer.
  Conclusions. The diurnal variation of the daytime seeing at Dome Fuji is
similar to that reported for Dome C, and the height of the surface boundary
layer is consistent with previous simulations for Dome Fuji. The free
atmosphere seeing is ~0.2'', and the height of the surface boundary layer can
be as low as ~11 m.",1305.5109v1,astro-ph.IM,2013-05-22 12:38:07+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('H. Okita'), arxiv.Result.Author('T. Ichikawa'), arxiv.Result.Author('M. C. B. Ashley'), arxiv.Result.Author('N. Takato')]",

is a critical parameter used to assess the quality of astronomical sites.
Median values at the best mid-latitude sites are generally in the range of
0.6--0.8\,arcsec. Sites on the Antarctic plateau are characterized by
comparatively-weak turbulence in the free-atmosphere above a strong but thin
boundary layer. The median seeing at Dome C is estimated to be 0.23--0.36
arcsec above a boundary layer that has a typical height of 30\,m. At Dome A and
F, the only previous seeing measurements were made during daytime. Here we
report the first direct measurements of night-time seeing at Dome A, using a
Differential Image Motion Monitor. Located at a height of just 8\,m, it
recorded seeing as low as 0.13\,arcsec, and provided seeing statistics that are
comparable to those for a 20\,m height at Dome C. It indicates that the
boundary layer was below 8\,m 31\% of the time. At such times the median seeing
was 0.31\,arcsec, consistent with free-atmosphere seeing. The seeing and
boundary layer thickness are found to be strongly correlated with the
near-surface temperature gradient. The correlation confirms a median thickness
of approximately 14\,m for the boundary layer at Dome A, as found from a sonic
radar. The thinner boundary layer makes it less challenging to locate a

since it enables users to see through a wall and see the occluded objects. Most
existing research focuses on the visual effects of see-through vision, while
the interaction method is less studied. However, we argue that using common
interaction modalities, e.g., midair click and speech, may not be the optimal
way to control see-through vision. This is because when we want to see through
something, it is physically related to our gaze depth/vergence and thus should
be naturally controlled by the eyes. Following this idea, this paper proposes a
novel gaze-vergence-controlled (GVC) see-through vision technique in AR. Since
gaze depth is needed, we build a gaze tracking module with two infrared cameras
and the corresponding algorithm and assemble it into the Microsoft HoloLens 2
to achieve gaze depth estimation. We then propose two different GVC modes for
see-through vision to fit different scenarios. Extensive experimental results
demonstrate that our gaze depth estimation is efficient and accurate. By
comparing with conventional interaction modalities, our GVC techniques are also
shown to be superior in terms of efficiency and more preferred by users.
Finally, we present four example applications of gaze-vergence-controlled
see-through vision.",2207.02645v1,cs.CV,2022-07-06 13:11:34+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Zhimin Wang'), arxiv.Result.Author('Yuxin Zhao'), arxiv.Result.Author('Feng Lu')]",

in a range of plasma simulations, here improved SEE model of a charged

coefficient and the energy dependency of SEE coefficient. Pertinent algorithms
to implement above SEE model in plasma simulation are studied in detail. It is
found that the SEE coefficient increases with the amount of negative wall
charges, which in turn reduces the emissive sheath potential. With energy
dependent SEE coefficient, the sheath potential is a nonlinear function of the
plasma electron temperature, as opposed to the linear relation predicted by
classic emissive sheath theory. Simulation combining both wall charging effect
and SEE coefficient energy dependency suggests that the space charged limited
sheath is formed at high plasma electron temperature levels, where both sheath
potential and surface charging saturate. Additionally, different algorithms to
implement the backscattering in kinetic simulation are tested and compared.

minimum guarantee is essential. When there are no minimum quotas, stability is
the de-facto notion of optimality. However, in the presence of minimum quotas,
ensuring stability and simultaneously satisfying lower quotas is not an
attainable goal in many instances.
  To address this, a relaxation of stability known as envy-freeness, is
proposed in literature. In our work, we thoroughly investigate envy-freeness

matchings that match maximum number of agents is computationally hard and also
hard to approximate up to a constant factor. Additionally, it is known that
envy-free matchings satisfying lower-quotas may not exist. To circumvent these
drawbacks, we propose a new notion called relaxed stability. We show that

772,Quota-based debiasing can decrease representation of already underrepresented groups,"Many important decisions in societies such as school admissions, hiring, or
elections are based on the selection of top-ranking individuals from a larger
pool of candidates. This process is often subject to biases, which typically
manifest as an under-representation of certain groups among the selected or
accepted individuals. The most common approach to this issue is debiasing, for
example via the introduction of quotas that ensure proportional representation
of groups with respect to a certain, often binary attribute. Cases include
quotas for women on corporate boards or ethnic quotas in elections. This,
however, has the potential to induce changes in representation with respect to
other attributes. For the case of two correlated binary attributes we show that
quota-based debiasing based on a single attribute can worsen the representation

773,Distributed Mixed Voltage Angle and Frequency Droop Control of Microgrid Interconnections with Loss of Distribution-PMU Measurements,"Recent advances in distribution-level phasor measurement unit (D-PMU)
technology have enabled the use of voltage phase angle measurements for direct
load sharing control in distribution-level microgrid interconnections with high
penetration of renewable distributed energy resources (DERs). In particular,
D-PMU enabled voltage angle droop control has the potential to enhance
stability and transient performance in such microgrid interconnections.
However, these angle droop control designs are vulnerable to D-PMU angle
measurement losses that frequently occur due to the unavailability of a GPS
signal for synchronization. In the event of such measurement losses, angle
droop controlled microgrid interconnections may suffer from poor performance
and potentially lose stability. In this paper, we propose a novel distributed
mixed voltage angle and frequency droop control (D-MAFD) framework to improve
the reliability of angle droop controlled microgrid interconnections. In this
framework, when the D-PMU phase angle measurement is lost at a microgrid,
conventional frequency droop control is temporarily used for primary control in
place of angle droop control to guarantee stability. We model the microgrid
interconnection with this primary control architecture as a nonlinear switched
system and design distributed secondary controllers to guarantee transient

Historically, power systems are dominated by synchronous generators that can

role in contributing to the system stability and enhancing the functionality of
the inverters. One of these novel control methods is droop control. Droop
characteristics are used to control voltage, frequency, and active and reactive
power. This paper presents the impact of frequency droop damping on system
frequency, real power, and the rate of change of frequency with distributed

droop behaviors are attributed to different carrier lifetimes, which are
prolonged as wavelength increases. This relationship between carrier lifetime
and indium composition of InGaN quantum well is believed owing to the
polarization-induced quantum confinement Stark effect. Long carrier lifetime
not only increases the probability of carrier leakage, but also results in high
carrier concentration in quantum well. In other words, under the same current
density, the carrier concentration in active region in near-UV LED is the
lowest while that in green one is the highest. If considering the efficiency
droop depending on carrier concentration, the behaviors of LEDs with different

on the RES inverters is an efficient and low cost solution to reach this
objective. However, fixing droop parameters or optimizing them only for
overvoltage conditions does not provide the required robustness and optimality

approach is proposed for reconfiguring PV and QV droop regulators during online
operation. The objective is to minimize power curtailment, power losses, and
voltage deviation subject to electrical security constraints. This enables to
optimally operate the grid with high RES penetration under variable conditions

impedance loads in the network. Sufficient conditions for the feasibility of

801,New Results on Equilibria in Strategic Candidacy,"We consider a voting setting where candidates have preferences about the
outcome of the election and are free to join or leave the election. The
corresponding candidacy game, where candidates choose strategically to
participate or not, has been studied %initially by Dutta et al., who showed
that no non-dictatorial voting procedure satisfying unanimity is
candidacy-strategyproof, that is, is such that the joint action where all
candidates enter the election is always a pure strategy Nash equilibrium. Dutta
et al. also showed that for some voting tree procedures, there are candidacy
games with no pure Nash equilibria, and that for the rule that outputs the
sophisticated winner of voting by successive elimination, all games have a pure
Nash equilibrium. No results were known about other voting rules. Here we prove
several such results. For four candidates, the message is, roughly, that most
scoring rules (with the exception of Borda) do not guarantee the existence of a
pure Nash equilibrium but that Condorcet-consistent rules, for an odd number of
voters, do. For five candidates, most rules we study no longer have this
guarantee. Finally, we identify one prominent rule that guarantees the
existence of a pure Nash equilibrium for any number of candidates (and for an
odd number of voters): the Copeland rule. We also show that under mild

This investigation is driven by a nice lemma of Haagerup which relates
logarithmic potentials and Chebyshev polynomials. The Poincar\'e inequality
revolves around the counting number operator for the Chebyshev polynomials of
first kind with respect to the arcsine law on $[-2,2]$. This counting number
operator appears naturally in a representation of the minimum of the

atomic shuffling and shear candidates for a given compound twinning mode in

mobility of twinning dislocations in non-Bravais metallic lattices, their
analytical expressions have not been previously derived. The method is
illustrated for both flat planes and corrugated planes which are exemplified by
{11-22} and {10-12} twinning modes, respectively. The method distinguishes
between shuffle displacements and net shuffles. While shuffle displacements
correspond to movements between ideal atom positions in the parent and twin
lattices, net shuffles comprise contributions from shear on overlying planes
which can operate along opposite directions to those of shuffle displacements.
Thus, net shuffles in the twinning direction can vanish in a limiting case, as
is interestingly the case for those needed in the second plane by the b_4
dislocation candidate in {11-22} twinning. It is found that while shuffle
displacement vectors can be irrational when K_1 is corrugated, net shuffle
vectors are always rational.",1309.1133v1,cond-mat.mtrl-sci,2013-09-04 18:46:35+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Haitham El Kadiri'), arxiv.Result.Author('Christopher D. Barrett'), arxiv.Result.Author('Mark A. Tschopp')]",Acta Materialia 61 (2013) 7646--7659

practical method for obtaining sufficient separability criteria. We
specifically vet the candidacy of driven and undriven superradiance as schema
for entanglement generation. We conclude by reviewing current approaches to
quantum contextuality, emphasizing the operational distinction between nonlocal
and contextual quantum statistics. We utilize our abstractly-weighted linear
quantum bounds to explicitly demonstrate a set of conditional probability

813,Dynamic Cluster Head Node Election (DCHNE) Model over Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs),"WSNs are becoming an appealing research area due to their several application
domains. The performance of WSNs depends on the topology of sensors and their
ability to adapt to changes in the network. Sensor nodes are often resource
constrained by their limited power, less communication distance capacity, and
restricted sensing capability. Therefore, they need to cooperate with each
other to accomplish a specific task. Thus, clustering enables sensor nodes to
communicate through the cluster head node for continuous communication process.
In this paper, we introduce a dynamic cluster head election mechanism. Each
node in the cluster calculates its residual energy value to determine its
candidacy to become the Cluster Head Node (CHN). With this mechanism, each
sensor node compares its residual energy level to other nodes in the same
cluster. Depending on the residual energy level the sensor node acts as the
next cluster head. Evaluation of the dynamic CHN election mechanism is
conducted using network simulator-2 (ns2). The simulation results demonstrate

requires knowing how the ballots cast in an election are organized into groups,
for instance, how many containers of ballots there are in all and how many
ballots are in each container. A list of the ballot group identifiers along
with number of ballots in each group is called a ballot manifest. What if the
ballot manifest is not accurate? Surprisingly, even if ballots are known to be
missing from the manifest, it is not necessary to make worst-case assumptions
about those ballots--for instance, to adjust the margin by the number of
missing ballots--to ensure that the audit remains conservative. Rather, it
suffices to make worst-case assumptions about the individual randomly selected
ballots that the audit cannot find. This observation provides a simple
modification to some risk-limiting audit procedures that makes them
automatically become more conservative if the ballot manifest has errors. The
modification--phantoms to evil zombies (~2EZ)--requires only an upper bound on
the total number of ballots cast. ~2EZ makes the audit P-value stochastically
larger than it would be had the manifest been accurate, automatically requiring
more than enough ballots to be audited to offset the manifest errors. This
ensures that the true risk limit remains smaller than the nominal risk limit.
On the other hand, if the manifest is in fact accurate and the upper bound on
the total number of ballots equals the total according to the manifest, ~2EZ
has no effect at all on the number of ballots audited nor on the true risk

indistinguishable from real ballots. By means of a game-theoretical model, we
show that decoy ballots may not provide effective protection against a
malevolent adversary trying to buy real ballots. If the citizenry is divided
into subgroups (or districts), the adversary can construct a so-called ""Devil's
Menu"" consisting of several prices. In equilibrium, the adversary can buy the
real ballots of any strict subset of districts at a price corresponding to the
willingness to sell on the part of the citizens holding such ballots. By
contrast, decoy voters are trapped into selling their ballots at a low, or even
negligible, price. Blowing up the adversary's budget by introducing decoy
ballots may thus turn out to be futile. The Devil's Menu can also be applied to
the well-known ""Lemons Problem"".",1712.05477v1,cs.GT,2017-12-14 23:54:58+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Hans Gersbach'), arxiv.Result.Author('Akaki Mamageishvili'), arxiv.Result.Author('Oriol Tejada')]",
825,The ATHENA Class of Risk-Limiting Ballot Polling Audits,"The main risk-limiting ballot polling audit in use today, BRAVO, is designed
for use when single ballots are drawn at random and a decision regarding
whether to stop the audit or draw another ballot is taken after each ballot
draw (ballot-by-ballot (B2) audits). On the other hand, real ballot polling
audits draw many ballots in a single round before determining whether to stop
(round-by-round (R2) audits). We show that BRAVO results in significant
inefficiency when directly applied to real R2 audits. We present the ATHENA
class of R2 stopping rules, which we show are risk-limiting if the round
schedule is pre-determined (before the audit begins). We prove that each rule
is at least as efficient as the corresponding BRAVO stopping rule applied at
the end of the round. We have open-source software libraries implementing most
of our results.
  We show that ATHENA halves the number of ballots required, for all state
margins in the 2016 US Presidential election and a first round with $90\%$
stopping probability, when compared to BRAVO (stopping rule applied at the end
of the round). We present simulation results supporting the 90% stopping
probability claims and our claims for the risk accrued in the first round.
Further, ATHENA reduces the number of ballots by more than a quarter for low
margins, when compared to the BRAVO stopping rule applied on ballots in
selection order. This implies that keeping track of the order when drawing
ballots R2 is not beneficial, because ATHENA is more efficient even without
information on selection order. These results are significant because current
approaches to real ballot polling election audits use the B2 BRAVO rules,
requiring about twice as much work on the part of election officials. Applying
the rules in selection order requires fewer ballots, but keeping track of the
order, and entering it into audit software, adds to the effort.",2008.02315v5,cs.CR,2020-08-05 18:47:37+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Filip Zagórski'), arxiv.Result.Author('Grant McClearn'), arxiv.Result.Author('Sarah Morin'), arxiv.Result.Author('Neal McBurnett'), arxiv.Result.Author('Poorvi L.

without affecting original vertex and edge properties. We further prove that
such the dummy node can help build an efficient monomorphic edge-to-vertex
transform and an epimorphic inverse to recover the original graph back. It also
indicates that adding dummy nodes can preserve local and global structures for
better graph representation learning. We extend graph kernels and graph neural
networks with dummy nodes and conduct experiments on graph classification and
subgraph isomorphism matching tasks. Empirical results demonstrate that taking

Our method involves doing $k$ ""cuts"", each involving moving a random portion of
ballots from the top to the bottom of the stack, and then picking the ballot on
top. Unlike conventional methods of picking a ballot at random, $k$-cut does
not require identification numbers on the ballots or counting many ballots per

justifiably high confidence that the reported results of an election are
consistent with an audit trail (""ballots""), which can be paper or electronic.
SOBA combines three ideas: (1) publishing cast vote records (CVRs) separately
for each contest, so that anyone can verify that each reported contest outcome
is correct, if the CVRs reflect voters' intentions with sufficient accuracy;
(2) shrouding a mapping between ballots and the CVRs for those ballots to
prevent the loss of privacy that could occur otherwise; (3) assessing the
accuracy with which the CVRs reflect voters' intentions for a collection of
contests while simultaneously assessing the integrity of the shrouded mapping
between ballots and CVRs by comparing randomly selected ballots to the CVRs
that purport to represent them. Step (1) is related to work by the Humboldt
County Election Transparency Project, but publishing CVRs separately for
individual contests rather than images of entire ballots preserves privacy.
Step (2) requires a cryptographic commitment from elections officials.
Observers participate in step (3), which relies on the ""super-simple
simultaneous single-ballot risk-limiting audit."" Step (3) is designed to reveal
relatively few ballots if the shrouded mapping is proper and the CVRs
accurately reflect voter intent. But if the reported outcomes of the contests

Recent studies (e.g., Bernhard, et al. 2020) suggest the verification rate is
low. What is not clear from previous research is whether this is more a result
of voters being unable to do so accurately or whether this is because voters
simply choose not to attempt verification in the first place. In order to
understand this problem, we conducted an experiment in which 108 participants
participated in a mock election where the BMD displayed the voters' true
choices, but then changed a subset of those choices on the printed ballot. The
design of the printed ballot, the length of the ballot, the number of changes
that were made to the ballot, the location of those changes, and the
instructions provided to the voters were manipulated as part of the experiment.
Results indicated that of those voters who chose to examine the printed ballot,
76% detected anomalies, indicating that voters can reliably detect errors on
their ballot if they will simply review it. This suggests that administrative

evidence against or in support of the recorded result. Risk-limiting audits for

elections. We define a number of approaches to ballot-polling and comparison
risk-limiting audits for Instant Runoff Voting (IRV) elections. We show that

traditional plurality voting in which voters submit rankings over the

influence the outcome of an election, given fixed voter preferences. We show
that there exist preference profiles over $k$ candidates such that up to $k-1$
different candidates win at different ballot lengths. We derive exact lower
bounds on the number of voters required for such profiles and provide a
construction matching the lower bound for unrestricted voter preferences.
Additionally, we characterize which sequences of winners are possible over
ballot lengths and provide explicit profile constructions achieving any
feasible winner sequence. We also examine how classic preference restrictions
influence our results--for instance, single-peakedness makes $k-1$ different
winners impossible but still allows at least $\Omega(\sqrt k)$. Finally, we
analyze a collection of 168 real-world elections, where we truncate rankings to
simulate shorter ballots. We find that shorter ballots could have changed the
outcome in one quarter of these elections. Our results highlight ballot length

840,"More style, less work: card-style data decrease risk-limiting audit sample sizes","U.S. elections rely heavily on computers such as voter registration
databases, electronic pollbooks, voting machines, scanners, tabulators, and
results reporting websites. These introduce digital threats to election
outcomes. Risk-limiting audits (RLAs) mitigate threats to some of these systems
by manually inspecting random samples of ballot cards. RLAs have a large chance
of correcting wrong outcomes (by conducting a full manual tabulation of a
trustworthy record of the votes), but can save labor when reported outcomes are
correct. This efficiency is eroded when sampling cannot be targeted to ballot
cards that contain the contest(s) under audit. If the sample is drawn from all
cast cards, RLA sample sizes scale like the reciprocal of the fraction of
ballot cards that contain the contest(s) under audit. That fraction shrinks as
the number of cards per ballot grows (i.e., when elections contain more
contests) and as the fraction of ballots that contain the contest decreases
(i.e., when a smaller percentage of voters are eligible to vote in the
contest). States that conduct RLAs of contests on multi-card ballots or of
small contests can dramatically reduce sample sizes by using information about
which ballot cards contain which contests -- by keeping track of card-style
data (CSD). For instance, CSD reduces the expected number of draws needed to
audit a single countywide contest on a 4-card ballot by 75%. Similarly, CSD
reduces the expected number of draws by 95% or more for an audit of two
contests with the same margin on a 4-card ballot if one contest is on every
ballot and the other is on 10% of ballots. In realistic examples, the savings
can be several orders of magnitude.",2012.03371v1,cs.CR,2020-12-06 20:35:12+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Amanda K. Glazer'), arxiv.Result.Author('Jacob V. Spertus'), arxiv.Result.Author('Philip B. Stark')]",
841,Non(c)esuch Ballot-Level Risk-Limiting Audits for Precinct-Count Voting Systems,"Risk-limiting audits (RLAs) guarantee a high probability of correcting
incorrect reported outcomes before the outcomes are certified. The most
efficient use ballot-level comparison, comparing the voting system's
interpretation of individual ballot cards sampled at random (cast-vote records,
CVRs) from a trustworthy paper trail to a human interpretation of the same
cards. Such comparisons require the voting system to create and export CVRs in
a way that can be linked to the individual ballots the CVRs purport to
represent. Such links can be created by keeping the ballots in the order in
which they are scanned or by printing a unique serial number on each ballot.
But for precinct-count systems (PCOS), these strategies may compromise vote
anonymity: the order in which ballots are cast may identify the voters who cast
them. Printing a unique pseudo-random number (""cryptographic nonce"") on each
ballot card after the voter last touches it could reduce such privacy risks.
But what if the system does not in fact print a unique number on each ballot or
does not accurately report the numbers it printed? This paper gives two ways to
conduct an RLA so that even if the system does not print a genuine nonce on
each ballot or misreports the nonces it used, the audit's risk limit is not
compromised (however, the anonymity of votes might be compromised). One method
allows untrusted technology to be used to imprint and to retrieve ballot cards.
The method is adaptive: if the technology behaves properly, this protection
does not increase the audit workload. But if the imprinting or retrieval system
misbehaves, the sample size the RLA requires to confirm the reported results
when the results are correct is generally larger than if the imprinting and
retrieval were accurate.",2207.01362v1,cs.CR,2022-07-04 12:35:42+00:00,[arxiv.Result.Author('Philip B. Stark')],
842,Sets of Half-Average Nulls Generate Risk-Limiting Audits: SHANGRLA,"Risk-limiting audits (RLAs) for many social choice functions can be reduced
to testing sets of null hypotheses of the form ""the average of this list is not
greater than 1/2"" for a collection of finite lists of nonnegative numbers. Such
social choice functions include majority, super-majority, plurality,
multi-winner plurality, Instant Runoff Voting (IRV), Borda count, approval
voting, and STAR-Voting, among others. The audit stops without a full hand
count iff all the null hypotheses are rejected. The nulls can be tested in many
ways. Ballot-polling is particularly simple; two new ballot-polling
risk-measuring functions for sampling without replacement are given.
Ballot-level comparison audits transform each null into an equivalent assertion
that the mean of re-scaled tabulation errors is not greater than 1/2. In turn,
that null can then be tested using the same statistical methods used for ballot
polling---but applied to different finite lists of nonnegative numbers.
SHANGRLA comparison audits are more efficient than previous comparison audits
for two reasons: (i) for most social choice functions, the conditions tested
are both necessary and sufficient for the reported outcome to be correct, while
previous methods tested conditions that were sufficient but not necessary, and
(ii) the tests avoid a conservative approximation. The SHANGRLA abstraction
simplifies stratified audits, including audits that combine ballot polling with
ballot-level comparisons, producing sharper audits than the ""SUITE"" approach.
SHANGRLA works with the ""phantoms to evil zombies"" strategy to treat missing
ballot cards and missing or redacted cast vote records. That also facilitates
sampling from ""ballot-style manifests,"" which can dramatically improve
efficiency when the audited contests do not appear on every ballot card.

848,Chunk Content is not Enough: Chunk-Context Aware Resemblance Detection for Deduplication Delta Compression,"With the growing popularity of cloud storage, removing duplicated data across
users is getting more critical for service providers to reduce costs. Recently,
Data resemblance detection is a novel technology to detect redundancy among
similarity. It extracts feature from each chunk content and treat chunks with
high similarity as candidates for removing redundancy. However, popular
resemblance methods such as ""N-transform"" and ""Finesse"" use only the chunk data
for feature extraction. A minor modification on the data chunk could seriously
deteriorate its capability for resemblance detection. In this paper, we
proposes a novel chunk-context aware resemblance detection algorithm, called
CARD, to mitigate this issue. CARD introduces a BP-Neural network-based
chunk-context aware model, and uses N-sub-chunk shingles-based initial feature
extraction strategy. It effectively integrates each data chunk content's
internal structure with the context information for feature extraction, the
impact of small changes in data chunks is significantly reduced. To evaluate
its performance, we implement a CARD prototype and conduct extensive
experiments using real-world data sets. The results show that CARD can detect
up to 75.03% more redundant data and accelerate the resemblance detection
operations by 5.6 to 17.8 times faster compared with the state-of-the-art
resemblance detection approaches.",2106.01273v1,cs.DC,2021-06-02 16:34:07+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Xuming Ye'), arxiv.Result.Author('Xiaoye Xue'), arxiv.Result.Author('Wenlong Tian'), arxiv.Result.Author('Zhiyong Xu'), arxiv.Result.Author('Weijun Xiao'), arxiv.Result.Author('Ruixuan Li')]",
849,Limiting Risk by Turning Manifest Phantoms into Evil Zombies,"Drawing a random sample of ballots to conduct a risk-limiting audit generally

with number of ballots in each group is called a ballot manifest. What if the
ballot manifest is not accurate? Surprisingly, even if ballots are known to be
missing from the manifest, it is not necessary to make worst-case assumptions
about those ballots--for instance, to adjust the margin by the number of
missing ballots--to ensure that the audit remains conservative. Rather, it
suffices to make worst-case assumptions about the individual randomly selected

modification to some risk-limiting audit procedures that makes them
automatically become more conservative if the ballot manifest has errors. The
modification--phantoms to evil zombies (~2EZ)--requires only an upper bound on
the total number of ballots cast. ~2EZ makes the audit P-value stochastically

more than enough ballots to be audited to offset the manifest errors. This
ensures that the true risk limit remains smaller than the nominal risk limit.

853,Testing Station for Fast Screening of Through Silicon Via (TSV)-enabled Application Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs) for Hard X-ray Imaging Detectors,"Application Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs) are used in space-borne
instruments for signal processing and detector readout. The electrical
interface of these ASICs to frontend printed circuit boards (PCBs) is commonly
accomplished with wire bonds. Through Silicon Via (TSV) technology has been
proposed as an alternative interconnect technique that will reduce assembly
complexity of ASIC packaging by replacing wire bonding with flip-chip bonding.
TSV technology is advantageous in large detector arrays where TSVs enable close
detector tiling on all sides. Wafer-level probe card testing of TSV ASICs is
frustrated by solder balls introduced onto the ASIC surface for flip-chip
bonding that hamper alignment. Therefore, we developed the ASIC Test Stand
(ATS) to enable rapid screening and characterization of individual ASIC die. We
successfully demonstrated ATS operation on ASICs originally developed for
CdZnTe detectors on the Nuclear Spectroscopic and Telescope Array (NuSTAR)
mission that were later modified with TSVs in a via-last process. We tested
both back-side blind-TSVs and front-side through-TSVs, with results from
internal test pulser measurements that demonstrate performance equal to or
exceeding the probe card wafer-level testing data. The ATS can easily be
expanded or duplicated in order to parallelize ASIC screening for large area

electoral control types, that C and D are identical: For each input I and each
election system, I is a Yes instance of both C and D, or of neither.
Surprisingly this had gone undetected, even as the field was score-carding how
many std. control types election systems were resistant to; various ""different""
cells on such score cards were, unknowingly, duplicate effort on the same
issue. This naturally raises the worry that other pairs of control types are
also identical, and so work still is being needlessly duplicated.
  We determine, for all std. control types, which pairs are, for elections
whose votes are linear orderings of the candidates, always identical. We show
that no identical control pairs exist beyond the known 7. We for 3 central
election systems determine which control pairs are identical (""collapse"") with
respect to those systems, and we explore containment/incomparability
relationships between control pairs. For approval voting, which has a different
""type"" for its votes, [HHM20]'s 7 collapses still hold. But we find 14
additional collapses that hold for approval voting but not for some election
systems whose votes are linear orderings. We find 1 additional collapse for
veto and none for plurality. We prove that each of the 3 election systems
mentioned have no collapses other than those inherited from [HHM20] or added
here. But we show many new containment relationships that hold between some
separating control pairs, and for each separating pair of std. control types
classify its separation in terms of containment (always, and strict on some
inputs) or incomparability.

855,Reliable Wireless Networking via Soft-Source Information Combining,"This paper puts forth a multi-stream networking paradigm, referred to as
soft-source-information-combining (SSIC), to support wireless Internet of
Things (IoT) applications with ultra-reliability requirements. For SSIC
networking, an SSIC dispatcher at the source dispatches duplicates of packets
over multiple streams, which may be established over different physical
wireless networks. If a packet on a stream cannot be decoded due to wireless
interference or noise, the decoder makes available the packet's soft
information. An aggregator then combines the soft information of the duplicates
to boost reliability. Of importance are two challenges: i) how to descramble
the scrambled soft information from different streams to enable correct SSIC;
ii) the construct of an SSIC dispatching and aggregation framework compatible
with commercial network interface cards (NICs) and TCP/IP networks. To address
the challenges, we put forth: i) a soft descrambling (SD) method to minimize
the bit-error rate (BER) and packet-error rate (PER) at the SSIC's output; ii)
an SSIC networking architecture readily deployable over today's TCP/IP networks
without specialized NICs. For concept proving and experimentation, we realized
an SSIC system over two Wi-Fi's physical paths in such a way that all legacy
TCP/IP applications can enjoy the reliability brought forth by SSIC without
modification. Experiments over our testbed corroborate the effectiveness of
SSIC in lowering the packet delivery failure rate and the possibility of SSIC
in providing 99.99% reliable packet delivery for short-range communication.",2204.04055v2,cs.NI,2022-04-08 13:18:12+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Lihao Zhang'), arxiv.Result.Author('Soung Chang Liew')]",

for use when single ballots are drawn at random and a decision regarding
whether to stop the audit or draw another ballot is taken after each ballot
draw (ballot-by-ballot (B2) audits). On the other hand, real ballot polling
audits draw many ballots in a single round before determining whether to stop
(round-by-round (R2) audits). We show that BRAVO results in significant
inefficiency when directly applied to real R2 audits. We present the ATHENA
class of R2 stopping rules, which we show are risk-limiting if the round
schedule is pre-determined (before the audit begins). We prove that each rule
is at least as efficient as the corresponding BRAVO stopping rule applied at
the end of the round. We have open-source software libraries implementing most

  We show that ATHENA halves the number of ballots required, for all state

of the round). We present simulation results supporting the 90% stopping
probability claims and our claims for the risk accrued in the first round.
Further, ATHENA reduces the number of ballots by more than a quarter for low
margins, when compared to the BRAVO stopping rule applied on ballots in
selection order. This implies that keeping track of the order when drawing
ballots R2 is not beneficial, because ATHENA is more efficient even without
information on selection order. These results are significant because current
approaches to real ballot polling election audits use the B2 BRAVO rules,
requiring about twice as much work on the part of election officials. Applying

870,"Voter Verification of BMD Ballots Is a Two-Part Question: Can They? Mostly, They Can. Do They? Mostly, They Don't","The question of whether or not voters actually verify ballots produced by
ballot marking devices (BMDs) is presently the subject of some controversy.
Recent studies (e.g., Bernhard, et al. 2020) suggest the verification rate is
low. What is not clear from previous research is whether this is more a result
of voters being unable to do so accurately or whether this is because voters
simply choose not to attempt verification in the first place. In order to
understand this problem, we conducted an experiment in which 108 participants
participated in a mock election where the BMD displayed the voters' true
choices, but then changed a subset of those choices on the printed ballot. The
design of the printed ballot, the length of the ballot, the number of changes
that were made to the ballot, the location of those changes, and the
instructions provided to the voters were manipulated as part of the experiment.
Results indicated that of those voters who chose to examine the printed ballot,
76% detected anomalies, indicating that voters can reliably detect errors on
their ballot if they will simply review it. This suggests that administrative
remedies, rather than attempts to alter fundamental human perceptual
capabilities, could be employed to encourage voters to check their ballots,

risk-limiting audits for Instant Runoff Voting (IRV) elections. We show that

traditional plurality voting in which voters submit rankings over the
candidates rather than single votes. In practice, elections using IRV often
restrict the ballot length, the number of candidates a voter is allowed to rank
on their ballot. We theoretically and empirically analyze how ballot length can
influence the outcome of an election, given fixed voter preferences. We show
that there exist preference profiles over $k$ candidates such that up to $k-1$
different candidates win at different ballot lengths. We derive exact lower
bounds on the number of voters required for such profiles and provide a
construction matching the lower bound for unrestricted voter preferences.
Additionally, we characterize which sequences of winners are possible over
ballot lengths and provide explicit profile constructions achieving any
feasible winner sequence. We also examine how classic preference restrictions
influence our results--for instance, single-peakedness makes $k-1$ different
winners impossible but still allows at least $\Omega(\sqrt k)$. Finally, we
analyze a collection of 168 real-world elections, where we truncate rankings to
simulate shorter ballots. We find that shorter ballots could have changed the
outcome in one quarter of these elections. Our results highlight ballot length

to be skipped if there are many checks to be performed in a short time. In

data in living organisms, Jain {\em et al.} (2016) proposed the study of codes

investigate algorithms associated with the study of these codes.
  Two words are said to be ${\le}k$-confusable if there exists two sequences of
tandem duplications of lengths at most $k$ such that the resulting words are
equal. We demonstrate that the problem of deciding whether two words is
${\le}k$-confusable is linear-time solvable through a characterisation that can
be checked efficiently for $k=3$. Combining with previous results, the decision
problem is linear-time solvable for $k\le 3$. We conjecture that this problem

highly critical in terms of security. Examples include password checks,
signature checks, secure boot, and user privilege checks. For embedded devices,
these security-critical branches are a preferred target of fault attacks as a
single bit flip or skipping a single instruction can lead to complete access to
a system. In the past, numerous redundancy schemes have been proposed in order
to provide control-flow-integrity (CFI) and to enable error detection on
processed data. However, current countermeasures for general purpose software
do not provide protection mechanisms for conditional branches. Hence, critical
branches are in practice often simply duplicated.
  We present a generic approach to protect conditional branches, which links an
encoding-based comparison result with the redundancy of CFI protection
mechanisms. The presented approach can be used for all types of data encodings
and CFI mechanisms and maintains their error-detection capabilities throughout
all steps of a conditional branch. We demonstrate our approach by realizing an
encoded comparison based on AN-codes, which is a frequently used encoding
scheme to detect errors on data during arithmetic operations. We extended the
LLVM compiler so that standard code and conditional branches can be protected

space efficiency for manifest contracts---contracts that check stronger
properties than simple types, e.g., ""is a natural"" instead of ""is an

  We show how to achieve sound space efficiency for manifest contracts with
strong predicate contracts. The essential trick is breaking the contract
checking down into coercions: structured, blame-annotated lists of checks. By
carefully preventing duplicate coercions from appearing, we can restore space
efficiency while keeping the same observable behavior.
  Along the way, we define a framework for space efficiency, traversing the
design space with three different space-efficient manifest calculi. We examine
the diverse correctness criteria for contract semantics; we conclude with a

887,Duplicate-sensitivity Guided Transformation Synthesis for DBMS Correctness Bug Detection,"Database Management System (DBMS) plays a core role in modern software from
mobile apps to online banking. It is critical that DBMS should provide correct
data to all applications. When the DBMS returns incorrect data, a correctness
bug is triggered. Current production-level DBMSs still suffer from insufficient
testing due to the limited hand-written test cases. Recently several works
proposed to automatically generate many test cases with query transformation, a
process of generating an equivalent query pair and testing a DBMS by checking
whether the system returns the same result set for both queries. However, all
of them still heavily rely on manual work to provide a transformation which
largely confines their exploration of the valid input query space.
  This paper introduces duplicate-sensitivity guided transformation synthesis
which automatically finds new transformations by first synthesizing many
candidates then filtering the nonequivalent ones. Our automated synthesis is
achieved by mutating a query while keeping its duplicate sensitivity, which is
a necessary condition for query equivalence. After candidate synthesis, we keep
the mutant query which is equivalent to the given one by using a query
equivalent checker. Furthermore, we have implemented our idea in a tool Eqsql

beam search eliminates this while-loop by vectorizing multiple hypotheses. This
vectorization is nontrivial as the expansion of the hypotheses within the
original RNN-T beam search can be different from each other. However, we found
that the hypotheses expanded only once at each decoding step in most cases;
thus, we constrained the maximum expansion number to one, thereby allowing
vectorization of the hypotheses. For further acceleration, we assign
constraints to the prefixes of the hypotheses to prune the redundant search
space. In addition, OSC beam search has duplication check among hypotheses
during the decoding process as duplication can undesirably shrink the search
space. We achieved significant speedup compared with other RNN-T beam search

refactorings for NASA's Formal Requirements Elicitation Tool (FRET), our
tool-of-choice. Refactoring is the process of reorganising software to improve
its internal structure without altering its external behaviour; it can also be
applied to requirements, to make them more manageable by reducing repetition.
FRET automatically translates requirements (written in its input language
Fretish) into Temporal Logic, which enables us to formally verify that
refactoring has preserved the requirements' underlying meaning. In this paper,
we present four refactorings for Fretish requirements and explain their
utility. We describe the application of one of these refactorings to the
requirements of a civilian aircraft engine software controller, to decouple the
dependencies from the duplication, and analyse how this changes the number of

output data strings in a single left-to-right pass in linear time. Data strings
are (unbounded) sequences of data values, tagged with symbols from a finite
set, over a potentially infinite data domain that supports only the operations
of equality and ordering. The transducer uses a finite set of states, a finite
set of variables ranging over the data domain, and a finite set of variables
ranging over data strings. At every step, it can make decisions based on the
next input symbol, updating its state, remembering the input data value in its
data variables, and updating data-string variables by concatenating data-string
variables and new symbols formed from data variables, while avoiding
duplication. We establish that the problems of checking functional equivalence
of two streaming transducers, and of checking whether a streaming transducer
satisfies pre/post verification conditions specified by streaming acceptors
over input/output data-strings, are in PSPACE. We identify a class of
imperative and a class of functional programs, manipulating lists of data

changing next-pointers of heap-nodes and by adding new nodes. The main

894,Modified belief propagation decoders for quantum low-density parity-check codes,"Quantum low-density parity-check codes can be decoded using a syndrome based
$\mathrm{GF}(4)$ belief propagation decoder. However, the performance of this
decoder is limited both by unavoidable $4$-cycles in the code's factor graph
and the degenerate nature of quantum errors. For the subclass of CSS codes, the
number of $4$-cycles can be reduced by breaking an error into an $X$ and $Z$
component and decoding each with an individual $\mathrm{GF}(2)$ based decoder.
However, this comes at the expense of ignoring potential correlations between
these two error components. We present a number of modified belief propagation
decoders that address these issues. We propose a $\mathrm{GF}(2)$ based decoder
for CSS codes that reintroduces error correlations by reattempting decoding
with adjusted error probabilities. We also propose the use of an augmented
decoder, which has previously been suggested for classical binary low-density
parity-check codes. This decoder iteratively reattempts decoding on factor
graphs that have a subset of their check nodes duplicated. The augmented
decoder can be based on a $\mathrm{GF}(4)$ decoder for any code, a
$\mathrm{GF}(2)$ decoder for CSS code, or even a supernode decoder for a
dual-containing CSS code. For CSS codes, we further propose a $\mathrm{GF}(2)$
based decoder that combines the augmented decoder with error probability
adjustment. We demonstrate the performance of these new decoders on a range of
different codes, showing that they perform favorably compared to other decoders
presented in literature.",1903.07404v2,quant-ph,2019-03-18 12:55:27+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Alex Rigby'), arxiv.Result.Author('JC Olivier'), arxiv.Result.Author('Peter Jarvis')]","Phys. Rev. A 100, 012330 (2019)"
895,Why C++ is not very fit for GUI programming,"With no intent of starting a holy war, this paper lists several annoying C++
birthmarks that the author has come across developing GUI class libraries.
C++'s view of classes, instances and hierarchies appears tantalizingly close to
GUI concepts of controls, widgets, window classes and subwindows. OO models of
C++ and of a window system are however different. C++ was designed to be a
""static"" language with a lexical name scoping, static type checking and
hierarchies defined at compile time. Screen objects on the other hand are
inherently dynamic; they usually live well beyond the procedure/block that
created them; the hierarchy of widgets is defined to a large extent by layout,
visibility and event flow. Many GUI fundamentals such as dynamic and geometric
hierarchies of windows and controls, broadcasting and percolation of events are
not supported directly by C++ syntax or execution semantics (or supported as
""exceptions"" -- pun intended). Therefore these features have to be emulated in
C++ GUI code. This leads to duplication of a graphical toolkit or a window
manager functionality, code bloat, engaging in unsafe practices and forgoing of
many strong C++ features (like scoping rules and compile-time type checking).
This paper enumerates a few major C++/GUI sores and illustrates them on simple
examples.",cs/0001003v1,cs.PL,2000-01-06 21:31:29+00:00,[arxiv.Result.Author('Oleg Kiselyov')],
896,Flow: Separating Consensus and Compute -- Execution Verification,"Throughput limitations of existing blockchain architectures are well
documented and are one of the most significant hurdles for their wide-spread
adoption. In our previous proof-of-concept work, we have shown that separating
computation from consensus can provide a significant throughput increase
without compromising security. In our architecture, Consensus Nodes only define
the transaction order but do not execute transactions. Instead, computing the
block result is delegated to compute-optimized Execution Nodes, and dedicated
Verification Nodes check the computation result. During normal operation,
Consensus Nodes do not inspect the computation but oversee that participating
nodes execute their tasks with due diligence and adjudicate potential result
challenges. While the architecture can significantly increase throughput,
Verification Nodes still have to duplicate the computation fully. In this
paper, we refine the architecture such that result verification is distributed
and parallelized across many Verification Nodes. The full architecture
significantly increases throughput and delegates the computation work to the
specialized Execution Nodes and the onus of checking it to a variety of less
powerful Verification Nodes. We provide a full protocol specification of the
verification process, including challenges to faulty computation results and
the resulting adjudication process. Furthermore, we formally prove liveness and
safety of the system.",1909.05832v1,cs.DC,2019-09-12 17:38:48+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Alexander Hentschel'), arxiv.Result.Author('Dieter Shirley'), arxiv.Result.Author('Layne Lafrance'), arxiv.Result.Author('Maor Zamski')]",

presented method is the first to automatically synthesise TSC circuits from

synthesised by the presented method have significantly lower overhead than the
previously reported best for every one of a set of 11 frequently used

comparison overhead, compared with an average of 69% for the previous best
reported values across the set. The methodology presented represents a
breakthrough in concurrent error detection (CED). The highly efficient, novel
designs produced are tailored to each circuit's function, rather than being
constrained by a particular modular CED design methodology. Results are
synthesised using two-input gates and are TSC with respect to all gate input
and output stuck-at faults. The method can be used to add CED with or without
modifications to the original logic, and can be generalised to any
implementation technology and fault model. An example circuit is analysed and

in modelling and understanding the chemical composition of stars in the
universe. Despite the significant work underway to produce these parameters for
many astrophysically important ions, uncertainties in these parameters remain
large and can propagate throughout the entire field of astronomy. The Belgian
repository of fundamental atomic data and stellar spectra (BRASS) aims to
provide the largest systematic and homogeneous quality assessment of atomic
data to date in terms of wavelength, atomic and stellar parameter coverage. To
prepare for it, we first compiled multiple literature occurrences of many
individual atomic transitions, from several atomic databases of astrophysical
interest, and assessed their agreement. Several atomic repositories were
searched and their data retrieved and formatted in a consistent manner. Data
entries from all repositories were cross-matched against our initial BRASS
atomic line list to find multiple occurrences of the same transition. Where
possible we used a non-parametric cross-match depending only on electronic
configurations and total angular momentum values. We also checked for duplicate
entries of the same physical transition, within each retrieved repository,
using the non-parametric cross-match. We report the cross-matched transitions
for each repository and compare their fundamental atomic parameters. We find
differences in log(gf) values of up to 2 dex or more. We also find and report
that ~2% of our line list and Vienna Atomic Line Database retrievals are
composed of duplicate transitions. Finally we provide a number of examples of
atomic spectral lines with different log(gf) values, and discuss the impact of
these uncertain log(gf) values on quantitative spectroscopy. All cross-matched

Tomography (CT), which is an important and most common modality in medical
imaging. This is mainly due to that the effectiveness of clinical diagnosis
using CT image lies on the image quality. The denoising technique for CT images
using window-based Multi-wavelet transformation and thresholding shows the
effectiveness in denoising, however, a drawback exists in selecting the closer
windows in the process of window-based multi-wavelet transformation and
thresholding. Generally, the windows of the duplicate noisy image that are
closer to each window of original noisy image are obtained by the checking them
sequentially. This leads to the possibility of missing out very closer windows
and so enhancement is required in the aforesaid process of the denoising
technique. In this paper, we propose a GA-based window selection methodology to
include the denoising technique. With the aid of the GA-based window selection
methodology, the windows of the duplicate noisy image that are very closer to
every window of the original noisy image are extracted in an effective manner.
By incorporating the proposed GA-based window selection methodology, the
denoising the CT image is performed effectively. Eventually, a comparison is

from a range of disciplines. The data underlying these networks is often
automatically gathered from API's, websites or existing databases. As a result,
the quality of this data is typically not manually validated, and the resulting
networks may be based on false, biased or incomplete data. In this paper, we
investigate the effect of data quality issues on the analysis of large
networks. We focus on the global board interlock network, in which nodes
represent firms across the globe, and edges model social ties between firms --
shared board members holding a position at both firms. First, we demonstrate
how we can automatically assess the completeness of a large dataset of 160
million firms, in which data is missing not at random. Second, we present a
novel method to increase the accuracy of the entries in our data. By comparing
the expected and empirical characteristics of the resulting network topology,
we develop a technique that automatically prunes and merges duplicate nodes and
edges. Third, we use a case study of the board interlock network of Sweden to
show how poor quality data results in incorrect network topologies, biased
centrality values and abnormal influence spread under a well-known diffusion
model. Finally, we demonstrate how our data quality assessment methods help
restore the correct network structure, ultimately allowing us to derive

process of merging noisy databases in the absence of unique identifiers to
remove duplicate entities. One major challenge of analysis with linked data is
identifying a representative record among determined matches to pass to an
inferential or predictive task, referred to as the \emph{downstream task}.
Additionally, incorporating uncertainty from ER in the downstream task is
critical to ensure proper inference. To bridge the gap between ER and the
downstream task in an analysis pipeline, we propose five methods to choose a
representative (or canonical) record from linked data, referred to as
canonicalization. Our methods are scalable in the number of records,
appropriate in general data scenarios, and provide natural error propagation
via a Bayesian canonicalization stage. The proposed methodology is evaluated on
three simulated data sets and one application -- determining the relationship
between demographic information and party affiliation in voter registration
data from the North Carolina State Board of Elections. We first perform
Bayesian ER and evaluate our proposed methods for canonicalization before
considering the downstream tasks of linear and logistic regression. Bayesian
canonicalization methods are empirically shown to improve downstream inference

promising candidate for satisfying increasing data storage needs. Compared to
conventional storage media, however, data stored in DNA is subject to a wider
range of errors resulting from various processes involved in the data storage
pipeline. In this paper, we consider correcting duplication errors for both
exact and noisy tandem duplications of a given length k. An exact duplication
inserts a copy of a substring of length k of the sequence immediately after
that substring, e.g., ACGT to ACGACGT, where k = 3, while a noisy duplication
inserts a copy suffering from substitution noise, e.g., ACGT to ACGATGT.
Specifically, we design codes that can correct any number of exact duplication
and one noisy duplication errors, where in the noisy duplication case the copy
is at Hamming distance 1 from the original. Our constructions rely upon
recovering the duplication root of the stored codeword. We characterize the
ways in which duplication errors manifest in the root of affected sequences and
design efficient codes for correcting these error patterns. We show that the
proposed construction is asymptotically optimal, in the sense that it has the

interface of these ASICs to frontend printed circuit boards (PCBs) is commonly

complexity of ASIC packaging by replacing wire bonding with flip-chip bonding.
TSV technology is advantageous in large detector arrays where TSVs enable close
detector tiling on all sides. Wafer-level probe card testing of TSV ASICs is
frustrated by solder balls introduced onto the ASIC surface for flip-chip
bonding that hamper alignment. Therefore, we developed the ASIC Test Stand

successfully demonstrated ATS operation on ASICs originally developed for
CdZnTe detectors on the Nuclear Spectroscopic and Telescope Array (NuSTAR)

the trained models are evaluated on different SE tasks, including code search,

results show that pre-trained language models are insensitive to the given
input, thus they achieve similar performance in these three SE tasks. We refer

decision without salient features, or where a model finds some irrelevant
relationships between the final decision and the dataset. Our study
investigates two approaches to mitigate the overinterpretation phenomenon:
whole word mask strategy and ensembling. To the best of our knowledge, we are

duplication operations of the form $\seq x = \seq a \seq b \seq c \to \seq y =
\seq a \seq b \seq b \seq c$, where $\seq x$ and $\seq y$ are sequences and
$\seq a$, $\seq b$, and $\seq c$ are their substrings, needed to generate a
binary sequence of length $n$ starting from a square-free sequence from the set
$\{0,1,01,10,010,101\}$. This problem is a restricted case of finding the
duplication/deduplication distance between two sequences, defined as the
minimum number of duplication and deduplication operations required to
transform one sequence to the other. We consider both exact and approximate
tandem duplications. For exact duplication, denoting the maximum distance to
the root of a sequence of length $n$ by $f(n)$, we prove that $f(n)=\Theta(n)$.
For the case of approximate duplication, where a $\beta$-fraction of symbols
may be duplicated incorrectly, we show that the maximum distance has a sharp
transition from linear in $n$ to logarithmic at $\beta=1/2$. We also study the
duplication distance to the root for sequences with a given root and for
special classes of sequences, namely, the de Bruijn sequences, the Thue-Morse
sequence, and the Fibbonaci words. The problem is motivated by genomic tandem
duplication mutations and the smallest number of tandem duplication events

automatically identify groups of duplicate and near-duplicate SATD comments and

and near-duplicate SATD comments from the target projects, which belong to
1,141 groups. We manually analyze the content and context of a sample of 1,505
SATD comments (by sampling 100 groups for each project) and identify if they
annotate the same root cause. We also investigate whether duplicate SATD
comments exist in code clones, whether they co-exist in the same file, and
whether they are introduced and removed simultaneously. Our preliminary study
reveals several surprising findings that would shed light on future studies
aiming to improve the management of duplicate SATD comments. For instance, only

and are important models of biological networks, including protein-protein
interaction networks and gene regulatory networks. Three models of graph growth
are studied: pure duplication growth, and two two-parameter models in which
duplication forms one element of the growth dynamics. A power-law degree
distribution is found to emerge in all three models. However, the parameter
space of the latter two models is characterized by a range of parameter values
for which duplication is the predominant mechanism of graph growth. For
parameter values that lie in this ``duplication-dominated'' regime, it is shown
that the degree distribution either approaches zero asymptotically, or
approaches a non-zero power-law degree distribution very slowly. In either
case, the approach to the true asymptotic degree distribution is characterized
by a dependence of the scaling exponent on properties of the initial degree
distribution. It is therefore conjectured that duplication-dominated,
scale-free networks may contain identifiable remnants of their early structure.
This feature is inherited from the idealized model of pure duplication growth,
for which the exact finite-size degree distribution is found and its asymptotic
properties studied.",cond-mat/0307717v2,cond-mat.stat-mech,2003-07-30 18:11:01+00:00,[arxiv.Result.Author('Alpan Raval')],

techniques used hash index comparison to remove duplicate query results. The
major drawback of using the hash index to remove duplicate query results is
that, if there is a slight change in formatting or word order, then hash index
is changed and query results are no more considered as duplicate even though
they have same contents. We presented an algorithm for detection and
elimination of duplicate query results from semantic web using hash index and

916,Duplicated Code Pattern Mining in Visual Programming Languages,"Visual Programming Languages (VPLs), coupled with the high-level abstractions
that are commonplace in visual programming environments, enable users with less
technical knowledge to become proficient programmers. However, the lower skill
floor required by VPLs also entails that programmers are more likely to not
adhere to best practices of software development, producing systems with high
technical debt, and thus poor maintainability. Duplicated code is one important
example of such technical debt. In fact, we observed that the amount of
duplication in the OutSystems VPL code bases can reach as high as $39\%$.
  Duplicated code detection in text-based programming languages is still an
active area of research with important implications regarding software
maintainability and evolution. However, to the best of our knowledge, the
literature on duplicated code detection for VPLs is very limited. We propose a
novel and scalable duplicated code pattern mining algorithm that leverages the
visual structure of VPLs in order to not only detect duplicated code, but also

917,Studying Duplicate Logging Statements and Their Relationships with Code Clones,"In this paper, we focus on studying duplicate logging statements, which are
logging statements that have the same static text message. We manually studied
over 4K duplicate logging statements and their surrounding code in five
large-scale open source systems. We uncovered five patterns of duplicate
logging code smells. For each instance of the duplicate logging code smell, we
further manually identify the potentially problematic and justifiable cases.
Then, we contact developers to verify our manual study result. We integrated
our manual study result and the feedback of developers into our automated
static analysis tool, DLFinder, which automatically detects problematic
duplicate logging code smells. We evaluated DLFinder on the five manually
studied systems and three additional systems. In total, combining the results
of DLFinder and our manual analysis, we reported 91 problematic duplicate
logging code smell instances to developers and all of them have been fixed. We
further study the relationship between duplicate logging statements, including
the problematic instances of duplicate logging code smells, and code clones. We
find that 83% of the duplicate logging code smell instances reside in cloned
code, but 17% of them reside in micro-clones that are difficult to detect using
automated clone detection tools. We also find that more than half of the
duplicate logging statements reside in cloned code snippets, and a large
portion of them reside in very short code blocks which may not be effectively
detected by existing code clone detection tools. Our study shows that, in
addition to general source code that implements the business logic, code clones
may also result in bad logging practices that could increase maintenance
difficulties.",2106.00339v1,cs.SE,2021-06-01 09:19:43+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Zhenhao Li'), arxiv.Result.Author('Tse-Hsun'), arxiv.Result.Author('Chen'), arxiv.Result.Author('Jinqiu Yang'), arxiv.Result.Author('Weiyi Shang')]",
918,Towards Understanding the Impacts of Textual Dissimilarity on Duplicate Bug Report Detection,"About 40% of software bug reports are duplicates of one another, which pose a
major overhead during software maintenance. Traditional techniques often focus
on detecting duplicate bug reports that are textually similar. However, in bug
tracking systems, many duplicate bug reports might not be textually similar,
for which the traditional techniques might fall short. In this paper, we
conduct a large-scale empirical study to better understand the impacts of
textual dissimilarity on the detection of duplicate bug reports. First, we
collect a total of 92,854 bug reports from three open-source systems and
construct two datasets containing textually similar and textually dissimilar
duplicate bug reports. Then we determine the performance of three existing
techniques in detecting duplicate bug reports and show that their performance
is significantly poor for textually dissimilar duplicate reports. Second, we
analyze the two groups of bug reports using a combination of descriptive
analysis, word embedding visualization, and manual analysis. We found that
textually dissimilar duplicate bug reports often miss important components
(e.g., expected behaviors and steps to reproduce), which could lead to their
textual differences and poor performance by the existing techniques. Finally,
we apply domain-specific embedding to duplicate bug report detection problems,
which shows mixed results. All these findings above warrant further
investigation and more effective solutions for detecting textually dissimilar
duplicate bug reports.",2212.09976v1,cs.SE,2022-12-20 03:39:24+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Sigma Jahan'), arxiv.Result.Author('Mohammad Masudur Rahman')]",
919,Arranging the order of passengers on the boarding bridge to reduce the boarding time for single-aisle aircraft,"Reducing the aircraft boarding time is a common problem not only for
airlines, but also for passengers and airports. Group boarding is a popular
boarding strategy that separates the passengers into several groups and those
groups, which are then called in a certain order. Group boarding can reduce the
boarding time compared with that in random order boarding; however, it is
insufficient in several real scenarios because the passengers are not separated
strictly into groups. In this paper, we propose a boarding strategy that
arranges the order of the boarding passengers at the boarding gate. Although
this approach appears more time-consuming, we show that such a rearrangement
can be applied efficiently to the waiting queue of a single-aisle aircraft. We
quantitatively demonstrate the boarding times for various patterns of this
approach and discuss the mechanism underlying the reduction of boarding time.
This strategy is a promising approach to reduce boarding times and can replace
the conventional boarding strategy.",2109.13431v1,physics.soc-ph,2021-09-28 02:01:00+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Sakurako Tanida'), arxiv.Result.Author('Katsuhiro Nishinari')]",

The system is transparent and enables each voter to verify that the tally
includes their ballot selection without requiring any understanding of
cryptography. This paper describes the system and its use in fall 2020, to vote
remotely in promotion committees in a university. Each voter fills out a form
in the cloud with their vote V (YES, NO, ABSTAIN) and a passphrase P-two words
entered by the voter. The system generates a verification prompt of the (P,V)
pairs and a tally of the votes, organized to help visualize how the votes add
up. After the polls close, each voter verifies that this table lists their
(P,V) pair and that the tally is computed correctly. The system is especially
appropriate for any small group making sensitive decisions. Because the system
would not prevent a coercer from demanding that their victim use a specified
passphrase, it is not designed for applications where such malfeasance would be
likely or go undetected. Results from 43 voters show that the system was
well-accepted, performed effectively for its intended purpose, and introduced
users to the concept of voter-verified elections. Compared to the commonly-used
alternatives of paper ballots or voting by email, voters found the system
easier to use, and that it provided greater privacy and outcome integrity.",2103.07180v1,cs.CR,2021-03-12 09:59:55+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Enka Blanchard'), arxiv.Result.Author('Ryan Robucci'), arxiv.Result.Author('Ted Selker'), arxiv.Result.Author('Alan Sherman')]",

needed for the set up of the clique; to instantiate the local voter; to send
input or control messages to that voter. No interlocutor is needed other than
the local voter. The other user modules are supposed to create coherent
pictures and instances of voters on other nodes of the machine and to manage
consistently the task of their local intermediary. All technicalities
concerning the set up of the clique and the exchange of messages between the
voters are completely transparent to the user module. In the following the
basic functionalities of the VotingFarm class will be discussed, namely how to

PBFT with dynamic nodes is called a dynamic PBFT. Clearly, the dynamic PBFT can
more strongly support the decentralization and distributed structure of
blockchain. However, analyzing dynamic PBFT blockchain systems will become more
interesting and challenging.
  In this paper, we propose a large-scale Markov modeling technique to analyze

this end, we set up a large-scale Markov process (and further a
multi-dimensional Quasi-Birth-and-Death (QBD) process) and provide performance

indicate how some key system parameters influence the performance measures of
the dynamic PBFT voting processes and of the dynamic PBFT blockchain system.
Therefore, by using the theory of multi-dimensional QBD processes and the

strategic voting when there is uncertainty about the voting method. We
introduce three notions of manipulability for a set of voting methods: sure,
safe, and expected manipulability. With the help of a computer program, we
identify voting scenarios in which uncertainty about the voting method may
reduce or even eliminate a voter's incentive to misrepresent her preferences.

give a general robustness result for cycles not relying on a tie-breaking rule,
showing that they persist under small enough perturbations of the behavior of
voters. Then we give examples in Approval Voting of electorates applying
simple, sincere and consistent heuristics (namely Laslier's Leader Rule or a
modification of it) leading to cycles with bad outcomes, either not electing an
existing Condorcet winner, or possibly electing a candidate ranked last by a
majority of voters. Using the robustness result, it follows that those ""bad
cycles"" persist even if only a (large enough) fraction of the electorate
updates its choice of ballot at each iteration.We complete these results with
examples in other voting methods, including ranking methods satisfying the
Condorcet criterion; an in silico experimental study of the rarity of

than that needed to push a polarized two-opinion population to the consensus
state, when the degree ($p$) of homophily is less than 0.8. For finite system,

It is well known that the US electoral college system is about 5 times more
likely to have a changed outcome due to vote corruption, when compared to a
majority vote. In fact, Mossel, O'Donnell and Oleszkiewicz proved in 2005 that
the majority voting method is most stable to this random vote corruption, among
voting methods where each person has a small influence on the election. We

corruption in votes. We also survey results on adversarial election

quickness of large network dynamics is usually quantified by the length of
transient paths, an analytically intractable measure. For discrete-time
dynamics of networks of binary elements, we address this dilemma with an
alternative unified framework by using a concept termed state concentration,
defined as the exponent of the average number of t-step ancestors in state
transition graphs. The state transition graph is defined by nodes corresponding
to network states and directed links corresponding to transitions. Using this
exponent, we interrogate the dynamics of random Boolean and majority vote

943,Leveraging Phone Mask Training for Phonetic-Reduction-Robust E2E Uyghur Speech Recognition,"In Uyghur speech, consonant and vowel reduction are often encountered,
especially in spontaneous speech with high speech rate, which will cause a
degradation of speech recognition performance. To solve this problem, we
propose an effective phone mask training method for Conformer-based Uyghur
end-to-end (E2E) speech recognition. The idea is to randomly mask off a certain
percentage features of phones during model training, which simulates the above
verbal phenomena and facilitates E2E model to learn more contextual
information. According to experiments, the above issues can be greatly
alleviated. In addition, deep investigations are carried out into different
units in masking, which shows the effectiveness of our proposed masking unit.
We also further study the masking method and optimize filling strategy of phone
mask. Finally, compared with Conformer-based E2E baseline without mask
training, our model demonstrates about 5.51% relative Word Error Rate (WER)
reduction on reading speech and 12.92% on spontaneous speech, respectively. The
above approach has also been verified on test-set of open-source data THUYG-20,

944,Single-phonon and multi-phonon excitations of the $γ$ vibration in rotating odd-$A$ nuclei,"Multi-phonon excitations in atomic nuclei were observed very rarely although
collective motions in quantum many-body systems are described as bosonic
excitations. In particular, the first two-phonon $\gamma$ vibrational
($2\gamma$) excitation in odd-$A$ nuclei was reported in 2006 and only a few
have been known. Quite recently, conspicuously enhanced $B(E2)$s feeding
$2\gamma$ states were observed in $^{105}$Nb and conjectured that their parent
states are candidates of $3\gamma$ states. In the present work, the model space
is enlarged from the present author's previous calculation for $^{103}$Nb. The
purpose is twofold: One is to see how the description of $2\gamma$ states is
improved, and the other is to examine the existence of collective $3\gamma$
states, and when they exist, study their collectivity through calculating
interband $B(E2)$s. The particle-vibration coupling model based on the cranking
model and the random-phase approximation is used to calculate the vibrational
states in rotating odd-$A$ nuclei. Interband $B(E2)$s are calculated by
adopting the method of the generalized intensity relation. The present
calculation reproduces the observed spectra of $0\gamma$ - $2\gamma$ states
well and gives collective $3\gamma$ states with enhanced $B(E2)$s to $2\gamma$
states in $^{103}$Nb and $^{105}$Nb. The most collective $3\gamma$ state with
the highest $K$ at zero rotation is thought to be the main component of the
observed band.",1406.3445v2,nucl-th,2014-06-13 07:47:13+00:00,[arxiv.Result.Author('Masayuki Matsuzaki')],"Phys. Rev. C90, 044313 (2014)"

948,EPIC: Efficient Privacy-Preserving Scheme with E2E Data Integrity and Authenticity for AMI Networks,"In Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI) networks, smart meters should send
fine-grained power consumption readings to electric utilities to perform
real-time monitoring and energy management. However, these readings can leak
sensitive information about consumers' activities. Various privacy-preserving
schemes for collecting fine-grained readings have been proposed for AMI
networks. These schemes aggregate individual readings and send an aggregated
reading to the utility, but they extensively use asymmetric-key cryptography
which involves large computation/communication overhead. Furthermore, they do
not address End-to-End (E2E) data integrity, authenticity, and computing
electricity bills based on dynamic prices. In this paper, we propose EPIC, an
efficient and privacy-preserving data collection scheme with E2E data integrity
verification for AMI networks. Using efficient cryptographic operations, each
meter should send a masked reading to the utility such that all the masks are
canceled after aggregating all meters' masked readings, and thus the utility
can only obtain an aggregated reading to preserve consumers' privacy. The
utility can verify the aggregated reading integrity without accessing the
individual readings to preserve privacy. It can also identify the attackers and
compute electricity bills efficiently by using the fine-grained readings
without violating privacy. Furthermore, EPIC can resist collusion attacks in
which the utility colludes with a relay node to extract the meters' readings. A
formal proof, probabilistic analysis are used to evaluate the security of EPIC,
and ns-3 is used to implement EPIC and evaluate the network performance. In
addition, we compare EPIC to existing data collection schemes in terms of
overhead and security/privacy features.",1810.01851v1,cs.CR,2018-10-03 17:35:23+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Ahmad Alsharif'), arxiv.Result.Author('Mahmoud Nabil'), arxiv.Result.Author('Samet Tonyali'), arxiv.Result.Author('Hawzhin Mohammed'), arxiv.Result.Author('Mohamed Mahmoud'), arxiv.Result.Author('Kemal Akkaya')]",

cross-modal shared embedding, and network integration with Interface. We
propose a simple and robust integration method for the E2E SLU network with
novel Interface, Continuous Token Interface (CTI), the junctional
representation of the ASR and NLU networks when both networks are pre-trained
with the same vocabulary. Because the only difference is the noise level, we
directly feed the ASR network's output to the NLU network. Thus, we can train
our SLU network in an E2E manner without additional modules, such as
Gumbel-Softmax. We evaluate our model using SLURP, a challenging SLU dataset
and achieve state-of-the-art scores on both intent classification and slot

challenging for ASR systems, particularly when numeric sequences are not seen
during training. This out-of-vocabulary (OOV) issue is addressed in
conventional ASR systems by training part of the model on spoken domain
utterances (e.g. I need one dollar and twenty five cents.), for which numeric
sequences are composed of in-vocabulary numbers, and then using an FST
verbalizer to denormalize the result. Unfortunately, conventional ASR models
are not suitable for the low memory setting of on-device speech recognition.
E2E models such as RNN-T are attractive for on-device ASR, as they fold the AM,
PM and LM of a conventional model into one neural network. However, in the
on-device setting the large memory footprint of an FST denormer makes spoken
domain training more difficult. In this paper, we investigate techniques to
improve E2E model performance on numeric data. We find that using a
text-to-speech system to generate additional numeric training data, as well as
using a small-footprint neural network to perform spoken-to-written domain
denorming, yields improvement in several numeric classes. In the case of the
longest numeric sequences, we see reduction of WER by up to a factor of 8.",1907.01372v1,eess.AS,2019-07-01 14:21:09+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Cal Peyser'), arxiv.Result.Author('Hao Zhang'), arxiv.Result.Author('Tara N. Sainath'), arxiv.Result.Author('Zelin Wu')]",
958,A Policy-based Approach to the SpecAugment Method for Low Resource E2E ASR,"SpecAugment is a very effective data augmentation method for both HMM and
E2E-based automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems. Especially, it also works
in low-resource scenarios. However, SpecAugment masks the spectrum of time or
the frequency domain in a fixed augmentation policy, which may bring relatively
less data diversity to the low-resource ASR. In this paper, we propose a
policy-based SpecAugment (Policy-SpecAugment) method to alleviate the above
problem. The idea is to use the augmentation-select policy and the
augmentation-parameter changing policy to solve the fixed way. These policies
are learned based on the loss of validation set, which is applied to the
corresponding augmentation policies. It aims to encourage the model to learn
more diverse data, which the model relatively requires. In experiments, we
evaluate the effectiveness of our approach in low-resource scenarios, i.e., the
100 hours librispeech task. According to the results and analysis, we can see
that the above issue can be obviously alleviated using our proposal. In
addition, the experimental results show that, compared with the
state-of-the-art SpecAugment, the proposed Policy-SpecAugment has a relative
WER reduction of more than 10% on the Test/Dev-clean set, more than 5% on the

sufficiently well the deformed mean-field structure as well as the cluster
structure and their mixed structure within the same framework. The improvement
over the original version of the antisymmetrized molecular dynamics which uses
the spherical Gaussian is verified by the application to $^{20}{\rm Ne}$

Since it has been long known that the pure $\alpha + ^{16}{\rm O}_{g.s.}$
cluster model underestimates the intra-band $E2$ transitions in the
$K^\pi$=$0^+_1$ band by about 30%, we consider that this success is due to the

965,Election in India: Polling in National Financial Switch,"Indian voters from Kashmir to Kanyakumari select their representatives to
form their parliament by going to polls. India's election is one of the largest
democratic exercise in the world history. About 850 million eligible voters
determine which political party or alliance will form the government and in
turn, will serve as prime minister. Given the electoral rules of placing a
polling place within 2 kilometers of every habitation, it comes as no surprise
that is indeed a humongous task for the Election Commission of India (ECI). It
sends around 11 million election workers through tough terrains to reach the
last mile. This exercise also comes as ever growing expenditure for the ECI.
This paper proposes the use of Automated Teller Machines (ATM) and Point Of
Sale (POS) machines to be used to cover as much as urban, rural and semi-urban
places possible given the wide network of National Financial Switch (NFS) and
increase in connectivity through Digital India initiative. This would add to

consequences for the polling results which can be used to identify election
irregularities. Using a suitable data collapse, we find that vote distributions
of elections with alleged fraud show a kurtosis of hundred times more than
normal elections on certain levels of data aggregation. As an example we show
that reported irregularities in recent Russian elections are indeed well
explained by systematic ballot stuffing and develop a parametric model
quantifying to which extent fraudulent mechanisms are present. We show that if
specific statistical properties are present in an election, the results do not
represent the will of the people. We formulate a parametric test detecting
these statistical properties in election results. Remarkably, this technique
produces similar outcomes irrespective of the data resolution and thus allows

decrypt each vote. Ballot sheets are encrypted by onion-routing, which has a
layer with the key of the election instance, so it's impossible for a quorum to
decode the results before they have announced their decision by exposing their
keys. A register of voters ensures that only verified voters can vote without
compromising their identity. If there any doubts about the identity of a voter,
their vote can be excluded from the election, if a quorum agrees. This system

972,"Exploring the Online Micro-targeting Practices of Small, Medium, and Large Businesses","Facebook and other advertising platforms exploit users data for marketing
purposes by allowing advertisers to select specific users and target them (the
practice is being called micro-targeting). However, advertisers such as
Cambridge Analytica have maliciously used these targeting features to
manipulate users in the context of elections. The European Commission plans to
restrict or ban some targeting functionalities in the new European Democracy
Action Plan act to protect users from such harms. The difficulty is that we do
not know the economic impact of these restrictions on regular advertisers. In
this paper, to inform the debate, we take a first step by understanding who is
advertising on Facebook and how they use the targeting functionalities. For
this, we asked 890 U.S. users to install a monitoring tool on their browsers to
collect the ads they receive on Facebook and information about how these ads
were targeted. By matching advertisers on Facebook with their LinkedIn
profiles, we could see that 71% of advertisers are small and medium-sized
businesses with 200 employees or less, and they are responsible for 61% of ads
and 57% of ad impressions. Regarding micro-targeting, we found that only 32% of
small and medium-sized businesses and 30% of large-sized businesses
micro-target at least one of their ads. These results should not be interpreted
as micro-targeting not being useful as a marketing strategy, but rather that
advertisers prefer to outsource the micro-targeting task to ad platforms.
Indeed, Facebook is employing optimization algorithms that exploit user data to
decide which users should see what ads; which means ad platforms are performing
an algorithmic-driven micro-targeting. Hence, when setting restrictions,
legislators should take into account both the traditional advertiser-driven
micro-targeting as well as algorithmic-driven micro-targeting performed by ad
platforms.",2207.09286v1,cs.CY,2022-07-19 14:16:54+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Salim Chouaki'), arxiv.Result.Author('Islem Bouzenia'), arxiv.Result.Author('Oana Goga'), arxiv.Result.Author('Beatrice Roussillon')]",

""chair"" who is seeking to control the election is allied with the manipulators,
and the case where the manipulators seek to thwart the chair. In the latter
case, we see that the order of play substantially influences the complexity. We
prove upper bounds, holding over every election system with a polynomial-time
winner problem, for all standard control cases, and some of these bounds are at
the second or third level of the polynomial hierarchy, and we provide matching
lower bounds to prove these tight. Nonetheless, for important natural systems
the complexity can be much lower. We prove that for approval and plurality
elections, the complexity of even competitive clashes between a controller and
manipulators falls far below those high bounds, even as low as polynomial time.

collect data about them when they visit a website. Such privacy policies take
time to read and are difficult to understand; on average, it takes a college
graduate to comprehend the policy and a user spends 12 minutes to read the

977,The Complexity of Online Manipulation of Sequential Elections,"Most work on manipulation assumes that all preferences are known to the
manipulators. However, in many settings elections are open and sequential, and
manipulators may know the already cast votes but may not know the future votes.
We introduce a framework, in which manipulators can see the past votes but not
the future ones, to model online coalitional manipulation of sequential
elections, and we show that in this setting manipulation can be extremely
complex even for election systems with simple winner problems. Yet we also show
that for some of the most important election systems such manipulation is
simple in certain settings. This suggests that when using sequential voting,
one should pay great attention to the details of the setting in choosing one's
voting rule.
  Among the highlights of our classifications are: We show that, depending on
the size of the manipulative coalition, the online manipulation problem can be
complete for each level of the polynomial hierarchy or even for PSPACE. We
obtain the most dramatic contrast to date between the nonunique-winner and
unique-winner models: Online weighted manipulation for plurality is in P in the
nonunique-winner model, yet is coNP-hard (constructive case) and NP-hard
(destructive case) in the unique-winner model. And we obtain what to the best
of our knowledge are the first PNP[1]-completeness and PNP-completeness results

completeness for, respectively, the complexity of 3-candidate and 4-candidate

order parameter dynamics (Glauber dynamics), in all the cases in which the
stochastic dynamics satisfy detailed balance, the critical percolation state
persists over a long period of time before usual coarsening of domains takes
over and eventually takes the system to equilibrium. By studying the
geometrical and statistical properties of time-evolving spin clusters we are
able to identify a characteristic length $\ell_p(t)$, different from the usual
length $\ell_d(t) \sim t^{1/z_{d}}$ that describes the late time coarsening,
that is involved in all scaling relations in the approach to the critical
percolation regime. We find that this characteristic length depends on the
particular microscopic dynamics and the lattice geometry. In the case of the

988,"Polarization, Abstention, and the Median Voter Theorem","The median voter theorem has long been the default model of voter behavior
and candidate choice. While contemporary work on the distribution of political
opinion has emphasized polarization and an increasing gap between the ""left""
and the ""right"" in democracies, the median voter theorem presents a model of
anti-polarization: competing candidates move to the center of the ideological
distribution to maximize vote share, regardless of the underlying ideological
distribution of voters. These anti-polar results, however, largely depend on
the ""singled-peakedness"" of voter preferences, an assumption that is rapidly
loosing relevance in the age of polarization. This article presents a model of
voter choice that examines three potential mechanisms that can undermine this
finding: a relative cost of voting that deters voters who are sufficiently
indifferent to both candidates, ideologically motivated third-party
alternatives that attract extreme voters, and a bimodal distribution of voter
ideology. Under reasonable sets of conditions and empirically observed voter
opinion distributions, these mechanisms can be sufficient to cause
strategically-minded candidates to fail to converge to the center, or to even
become more polarized than their electorate.",2103.12847v1,physics.soc-ph,2021-03-23 21:14:22+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Matthew I. Jones'), arxiv.Result.Author('Antonio D. Sirianni'), arxiv.Result.Author('Feng Fu')]",
989,A Fault Tolerance Improved Majority Voter for TMR System Architectures,"For digital system designs, triple modular redundancy (TMR), which is a
3-tuple version of N-modular redundancy is widely preferred for many
mission-control and safety-critical applications. The TMR scheme involves
two-times duplication of the simplex system hardware, with a majority voter
ensuring correctness provided at least two out of three copies of the system
remain operational. Thus the majority voter plays a pivotal role in ensuring
the correct operation of the system. The fundamental assumption implicit in the
TMR scheme is that the majority voter does not become faulty, which may not
hold well for implementations based on latest technology nodes with dimensions
of the order of just tens of nanometers. To overcome the drawbacks of the
classical majority voter some new voter designs were put forward in the
literature with the aim of enhancing the fault tolerance. However, these voter
designs generally ensure the correct system operation in the presence of either
a faulty function module or the faulty voter, considered only in isolation.
Since multiple faults may no longer be excluded in the nanoelectronics regime,
simultaneous fault occurrences on both the function module and the voter should
be considered, and the fault tolerance of the voters have to be analyzed under
such a scenario. In this context, this article proposes a new fault-tolerant
majority voter which is found to be more robust to faults than the existing
voters in the presence of faults occurring internally and/or externally to the
voter. Moreover, the proposed voter features less power dissipation, delay, and
area metrics based on the simulation results obtained by using a 32/28nm CMOS
process.",1605.03771v2,cs.AR,2016-05-12 11:54:44+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('P Balasubramanian'), arxiv.Result.Author('K Prasad')]","WSEAS Transactions on Circuits and Systems, vol. 15, Article #14,

990,On the Computational Complexity of Variants of Combinatorial Voter Control in Elections,"Voter control problems model situations in which an external agent tries
toaffect the result of an election by adding or deleting the fewest number of
voters. The goal of the agent is to make a specific candidate either win
(\emph{constructive} control) or lose (\emph{destructive} control) the
election. We study the constructive and destructive voter control problems
whenadding and deleting voters have a \emph{combinatorial flavor}: If we add
(resp.\ delete) a voter~$v$, we also add (resp.\ delete) a bundle~$\kappa(v) $
of voters that are associated with~$v$. While the bundle~$\kappa(v)$ may have
more than one voter, a voter may also be associated with more than one voter.
We analyze the computational complexity of the four voter control problems for
the Plurality rule. We obtain that, in general, making a candidate lose is
computationally easier than making her win. In particular, if the bundling
relation is symmetric (i.e.\ $\forall w\colon w \in \kappa(v) \Leftrightarrow v
\in \kappa(w) $), and if each voter has at most two voters associated with him,
then destructive control is polynomial-time solvable while the constructive
variant remains $\NP$-hard. Even if the bundles are disjoint (i.e.\ $\forall
w\colon w \in \kappa(v) \Leftrightarrow \kappa(v) = \kappa(w) $), the
constructive problem variants remain intractable. Finally, the minimization
variant of constructive control by adding voters does not admit an efficient
approximation algorithm, unless P=NP.",1701.05108v1,cs.MA,2017-01-18 15:36:46+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Leon Kellerhals'), arxiv.Result.Author('Viatcheslav Korenwein'), arxiv.Result.Author('Philipp Zschoche'), arxiv.Result.Author('Robert Bredereck'), arxiv.Result.Author('Jiehua Chen')]",

congressional elections. This is achieved by predicting an individual voter's
likelihood to vote and an individual voter's likelihood to vote for a given
party, if he votes. We make a rough prediction of these values. We then update
these predictions by incorporating information on a municipality wide basis via
aggregate data to enhance our estimate under the assumption that nearby voters
have similar behavior, which could be due to social interaction or common
external factors. Finally, we use a ranking scheme on these predictions to
identify two key types of voter: 1) Voters who are likely to vote that we can
convince to vote for a given party; and, 2) Voters who are likely to vote for a
given party, if they vote, that we can convince to actually turn out to vote.
Once these voters have been identified, a political campaign can use this
information to micro-target voters and win more votes.",1405.5111v1,physics.soc-ph,2014-05-19 06:30:42+00:00,[arxiv.Result.Author('Steven Ambadjes')],

to study the impact the Internet has had on election campaigning in Canada.
With the explosion of use the Net has seen since the 1997 general election,
Canadian federal parties stood at the threshold of a new age in election
campaigning. Pundits such as Rheingold (1993) have argued that the Internet
will provide citizens with a way to bypass traditional media and gain
unmediated access to each parties political message as well as providing a
forum for citizens to engage the parties, and each other in deliberative
debate.
  Through a longitudinal analysis of party web pages and telephone interviews
with party staffers, we analyze the role the Internet played in the election
campaigns of Canada's federal parties. Our findings indicate that the parties
are still focusing on providing online features that talk at the voter instead
of engaging them in any type of meaningful discourse. Most of these sites were
exceptionally similar in their structure and in the type of content they
provided. Generally, these sites served as digital archives for campaign
material created with other media in mind and despite the multimedia
capabilities of the Internet, these sites tended to be overwhelmingly text
oriented. In line with Stromer-Galley's (2000) discussion of why candidates in
the U.S. avoid online interaction, we also argue that little incentive exists

voter registration scheme enabling voters to create verifiable and
indistinguishable real and fake credentials using an untrusted kiosk inside a
privacy booth at a supervised location, e.g., the registrar's office. TRIP
ensures the integrity of the voter's real credential while enabling the
creation of fake credentials using interactive zero-knowledge proofs between
the voter as the verifier and the kiosk as the prover, unbeknownst to the
average voter. TRIP ensures that even voters who are under extreme coercion,
and cannot leave the booth with a real credential, can delegate their vote to a
political party, with the caveat that they must then trust the kiosk. TRIP
optimizes the tallying process by limiting the number of credentials a voter
can receive and capping the number of votes that a credential can cast per
election. We conduct a preliminary usability study among 41 participants at a
university and found that 42.5% of participants rated TRIP a B or higher in

with different preferences in different states; or predetermined with the same
preference in every state. In this setting, even if every voter is a contingent
voter, agents voting according to their private information need not result in
the adoption of the universally preferred alternative, because the signals can
be systematically biased.
  We present an easy-to-deploy mechanism that elicits and aggregates the
private signals from the voters, and outputs the alternative that is favored by
the majority. In particular, voters truthfully reporting their signals forms a
strong Bayes Nash equilibrium (where no coalition of voters can deviate and
receive a better outcome).",2108.03749v1,cs.GT,2021-08-08 22:20:15+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Grant Schoenebeck'), arxiv.Result.Author('Biaoshuai Tao')]","Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems 2021, Vol. 34,

almost linear in the number of alternatives. It is therefore unclear whether
these results remain intact when the number of voters is bounded, as is, for
example, typically the case in search engine aggregation settings. In this
paper, we provide a systematic study of majority digraphs for a constant number
of voters resulting in analytical, experimental, and complexity-theoretic
insights. First, we characterize the set of digraphs that can be induced by two
and three voters, respectively, and give sufficient conditions for larger
numbers of voters. Second, we present a surprisingly efficient implementation
via SAT solving for computing the minimal number of voters that is required to
induce a given digraph and experimentally evaluate how many voters are required
to induce the majority digraphs of real-world and generated preference
profiles. Finally, we leverage our sufficient conditions to show that the
winner determination problem of various well-known voting rules remains hard
even when there is only a small constant number of voters. In particular, we
show that Kemeny's rule is hard to evaluate for 7 voters, while previous
methods could only establish such a result for constant even numbers of voters.",1704.06304v1,cs.GT,2017-04-20 19:04:28+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Georg Bachmeier'), arxiv.Result.Author('Felix Brandt'), arxiv.Result.Author('Christian Geist'), arxiv.Result.Author('Paul Harrenstein'), arxiv.Result.Author('Keyvan Kardel'), arxiv.Result.Author('Dominik Peters'), arxiv.Result.Author('Hans Georg Seedig')]",

role of social networks in promoting content on Digg, a social news aggregator

to feature the most interesting stories on its front page, and it aggregates
opinions of its many users to identify them. Like other social networking

stories they found interesting. We studied the spread of interest in news
stories submitted to Digg in June 2006. Our results suggest that pattern of the
spread of interest in a story on the network is indicative of how popular the
story will become. Stories that spread mainly outside of the submitter's
neighborhood go on to be very popular, while stories that spread mainly through
submitter's social neighborhood prove not to be very popular. This effect is

differential pricing for access to content or ad placement. Prediction would
also give consumers an important tool for filtering the ever-growing amount of
content. Predicting popularity of content in social media, however, is
challenging due to the complex interactions among content quality, how the
social media site chooses to highlight content, and influence among users.
While these factors make it difficult to predict popularity \emph{a priori}, we
show that stochastic models of user behavior on these sites allows predicting
popularity based on early user reactions to new content. By incorporating
aspects of the web site design, such models improve on predictions based on

identify voting scenarios in which uncertainty about the voting method may
reduce or even eliminate a voter's incentive to misrepresent her preferences.

of voters are private information and a positive outcome is achieved if
well-behaving agents win. We illustrate that vote delegation leads to quite
different outcomes than conventional voting with abstention. In particular, we
obtain three insights: First, if the number of misbehaving voters, denoted by f
, is high, both voting methods fail to deliver a positive outcome. Second, if f
takes an intermediate value, conventional voting delivers a positive outcome,
while vote delegation fails with probability one. Third, if f is low,
delegation delivers a positive outcome with higher probability than
conventional voting. Finally, our results characterize worst-case outcomes that
can happen in a liquid democracy.",2102.08823v2,cs.GT,2021-02-17 15:32:32+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Hans Gersbach'), arxiv.Result.Author('Akaki Mamageishvili'), arxiv.Result.Author('Manvir Schneider')]",
1012,Modeling Voting for System Combination in Machine Translation,"System combination is an important technique for combining the hypotheses of
different machine translation systems to improve translation performance.
Although early statistical approaches to system combination have been proven
effective in analyzing the consensus between hypotheses, they suffer from the
error propagation problem due to the use of pipelines. While this problem has
been alleviated by end-to-end training of multi-source sequence-to-sequence
models recently, these neural models do not explicitly analyze the relations
between hypotheses and fail to capture their agreement because the attention to
a word in a hypothesis is calculated independently, ignoring the fact that the
word might occur in multiple hypotheses. In this work, we propose an approach
to modeling voting for system combination in machine translation. The basic
idea is to enable words in hypotheses from different systems to vote on words
that are representative and should get involved in the generation process. This
can be done by quantifying the influence of each voter and its preference for
each candidate. Our approach combines the advantages of statistical and neural
methods since it can not only analyze the relations between hypotheses but also
allow for end-to-end training. Experiments show that our approach is capable of
better taking advantage of the consensus between hypotheses and achieves
significant improvements over state-of-the-art baselines on Chinese-English and
English-German machine translation tasks.",2007.06943v1,cs.CL,2020-07-14 09:59:38+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Xuancheng Huang'), arxiv.Result.Author('Jiacheng Zhang'), arxiv.Result.Author('Zhixing Tan'), arxiv.Result.Author('Derek F.

1013,Proof of Travel for Trust-Based Data Validation in V2I Communication,"Previous work on misbehavior detection and trust management for
Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) communication can identify falsified and malicious
messages, enabling witness vehicles to report observations about
high-criticality traffic events. However, there may not exist enough ""benign""
vehicles with V2X connectivity or vehicle owners who are willing to opt-in in
the early stages of connected-vehicle deployment. In this paper, we propose a
security protocol for the communication between vehicles and infrastructure,
titled Proof-of-Travel (POT), to answer the research question: How can we
transform the power of cryptography techniques embedded within the protocol
into social and economic mechanisms to simultaneously incentivize
Vehicle-to-Infrastructure (V2I) data sharing and validate data trustworthiness?
  The key idea is to determine the reputation of and the contribution made by a
vehicle based on its distance traveled and the information it shared through
V2I channels. In particular, the total vehicle miles traveled for a vehicle
must be testified by digital signatures signed by each infrastructure component
along the path of its movement. While building a chain of proofs of spatial
movement creates burdens for malicious vehicles, acquiring proofs does not
result in extra costs for normal vehicles, which naturally want to move from
the origin to the destination. The proposed POT protocol is used for enhancing
the security of previous voting-based data validation algorithms. For the
POT-enhanced voting, we prove that all vehicles choosing to cheat are not a
pure Nash equilibrium by using game-theoretic analysis. Simulation results
suggest that the POT-enhanced voting is more robust to malicious data.",2104.05070v3,cs.CR,2021-04-11 18:25:56+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Dajiang Suo'), arxiv.Result.Author('Baichuan Mo'), arxiv.Result.Author('Jinhua Zhao'), arxiv.Result.Author('Sanjay E. Sarma')]",

voting"" model to allow probabilistic voting, partial voting, and correlated
team voting. We extend the standard Banzhaf metric to account for these cases;
our generalization reduces to the standard metric under ""random voting"", This

We study three of the most common methods used to modify voting rules to deal
with such partial votes. These methods modify scoring rules (like the Borda
count), elimination style rules (like single transferable vote) and rules based
on the tournament graph (like Copeland) respectively. We argue that with an
elimination style voting rule like single transferable vote, partial voting
does not change the situations where strategic voting is possible. However,
with scoring rules and rules based on the tournament graph, partial voting can
increase the situations where strategic voting is possible. As a consequence,
the computational complexity of computing a strategic vote can change. For
example, with Borda count, the complexity of computing a strategic vote can
decrease or stay the same depending on how we score partial votes.",1405.7714v1,cs.GT,2014-05-28 12:13:52+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Nina Narodytska'), arxiv.Result.Author('Toby Walsh')]",

voting on their behalf for the voters. Ballot voting, and in recent times,
electronic voting via electronic voting machines (EVMs) improves fairness by
relying on centralized trust. Homomorphic encryption-based voting protocols
also assure fairness but cannot scale to large scale elections such as
presidential elections. In this paper, we leverage the blockchain technology of
distributing trust to propose a smart contract-based protocol, namely, \proto.
There are many existing protocols for voting using smart contracts. We observe
that these either are not scalable or leak the vote tally during the voting
stage, i.e., do not provide vote concealment. In contrast, we show that FASTEN
preserves voter's privacy ensures vote concealment, immutability, and avoids
double voting. We prove that the probability of privacy breaches is negligibly
small. Further, our cost analysis of executing FASTEN over Ethereum is
comparable to most of the existing cost of elections.",2102.10594v1,cs.CR,2021-02-21 12:29:23+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Sankarshan Damle'), arxiv.Result.Author('Sujit Gujar'), arxiv.Result.Author('Moin Hussain Moti')]",
1017,Early Exiting with Ensemble Internal Classifiers,"As a simple technique to accelerate inference of large-scale pre-trained
models, early exiting has gained much attention in the NLP community. It allows
samples to exit early at internal classifiers without passing through the
entire model. Most existing work usually trains the internal classifiers
independently and employs an exiting strategy to decide whether or not to exit
based on the confidence of the current internal classifier. However, none of
these works takes full advantage of the fact that the internal classifiers are
trained to solve the same task therefore can be used to construct an ensemble.
In this paper, we show that a novel objective function for the training of the
ensemble internal classifiers can be naturally induced from the perspective of
ensemble learning and information theory. The proposed training objective
consists of two terms: one for accuracy and the other for the diversity of the
internal classifiers. In contrast, the objective used in prior work is exactly
the accuracy term of our training objective therefore only optimizes the
accuracy but not diversity. Further, we propose a simple voting-based strategy
that considers predictions of all the past internal classifiers to infer the
correct label and decide whether to exit. Experimental results on various NLP
tasks show that our proposed objective function and voting-based strategy can
achieve better accuracy-speed trade-offs.",2105.13792v1,cs.CL,2021-05-28 12:54:11+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Tianxiang Sun'), arxiv.Result.Author('Yunhua Zhou'), arxiv.Result.Author('Xiangyang Liu'), arxiv.Result.Author('Xinyu Zhang'), arxiv.Result.Author('Hao Jiang'), arxiv.Result.Author('Zhao Cao'), arxiv.Result.Author('Xuanjing Huang'), arxiv.Result.Author('Xipeng Qiu')]",

performed without sound scientific rigour do not yield representative results.
Yet, both inside and outside Belarus it is of great importance to obtain
precise estimates of the ratings of all candidates. These ratings could
function as reliable proxies for the election's outcomes. We conduct an
independent poll based on the combination of the data collected via Viber and
on the streets of Belarus. The Viber and the street data samples consist of
almost 45000 and 1150 unique observations respectively. Bayesian regressions
with poststratification were build to estimate ratings of the candidates and
rates of early voting turnout for the population as a whole and within various
focus subgroups. We show that both the officially announced results of the
election and early voting rates are highly improbable. With a probability of at
least 95%, Sviatlana Tikhanouskaya's rating lies between 75% and 80%, whereas
Aliaksandr Lukashenka's rating lies between 13% and 18% and early voting rate
predicted by the method ranges from 9% to 13% of those who took part in the
election. These results contradict the officially announced outcomes, which are
10.12%, 80.11%, and 49.54% respectively and lie far outside even the 99.9%
credible intervals predicted by our model. The only marginal groups of people
where the upper bounds of the 99.9% credible intervals of the rating of
Lukashenka are above 50% are people older than 60 and uneducated people. For
all other marginal subgroups, including rural residents, even the upper bounds
of 99.9% credible intervals for Lukashenka are far below 50%. The same is true
for the population as a whole. Thus, with a probability of at least 99.9%

majority-vote type, and degrees of anisotropy are varied. Although early works
showed that coupled map lattices and PCAs with synchronously updating rules
belong to a universality class distinct from the Ising class, careful
calculations reveal that synchronous Glauber PCAs should be categorized into
the Ising class, regardless of the degree of anisotropy. Majority-vote PCAs for
the system size considered yield exponents $\nu$ which are between those of the
two classes, closer to the Ising value, with slight dependence on the

AI-powered creative writing tools. However, most prior work on human-AI
collaboration in the creative writing domain has evaluated new systems with
amateur writers, typically in contrived user studies of limited scope. In this
work, we commissioned 13 professional, published writers from a diverse set of
creative writing backgrounds to craft stories using Wordcraft, a text editor
with built-in AI-powered writing assistance tools. Using interviews and
participant journals, we discuss the potential of NLG to have significant
impact in the creative writing domain--especially with respect to
brainstorming, generation of story details, world-building, and research
assistance. Experienced writers, more so than amateurs, typically have
well-developed systems and methodologies for writing, as well as distinctive
voices and target audiences. Our work highlights the challenges in building for
these writers; NLG technologies struggle to preserve style and authorial voice,
and they lack deep understanding of story contents. In order for AI-powered
writing assistants to realize their full potential, it is essential that they

1040,Sampling-Based Winner Prediction in District-Based Elections,"In a district-based election, we apply a voting rule $r$ to decide the
winners in each district, and a candidate who wins in a maximum number of
districts is the winner of the election. We present efficient sampling-based
algorithms to predict the winner of such district-based election systems in
this paper. When $r$ is plurality and the margin of victory is known to be at
least $\varepsilon$ fraction of the total population, we present an algorithm
to predict the winner. The sample complexity of our algorithm is
$\mathcal{O}\left(\frac{1}{\varepsilon^4}\log
\frac{1}{\varepsilon}\log\frac{1}{\delta}\right)$. We complement this result by
proving that any algorithm, from a natural class of algorithms, for predicting
the winner in a district-based election when $r$ is plurality, must sample at
least $\Omega\left(\frac{1}{\varepsilon^4}\log\frac{1}{\delta}\right)$ votes.
We then extend this result to any voting rule $r$. Loosely speaking, we show
that we can predict the winner of a district-based election with an extra
overhead of
$\mathcal{O}\left(\frac{1}{\varepsilon^2}\log\frac{1}{\delta}\right)$ over the
sample complexity of predicting the single-district winner under $r$. We
further extend our algorithm for the case when the margin of victory is
unknown, but we have only two candidates. We then consider the median voting
rule when the set of preferences in each district is single-peaked. We show
that the winner of a district-based election can be predicted with
$\mathcal{O}\left(\frac{1}{\varepsilon^4}\log\frac{1}{\varepsilon}\log\frac{1}{\delta}\right)$

1041,Agent-based Simulation of District-based Elections,"In district-based elections, electors cast votes in their respective
districts. In each district, the party with maximum votes wins the
corresponding seat in the governing body. The election result is based on the
number of seats won by different parties. In this system, locations of electors
across the districts may severely affect the election result even if the total
number of votes obtained by different parties remains unchanged. A less popular
party may end up winning more seats if their supporters are suitably
distributed spatially. This happens due to various regional and social
influences on individual voters which modulate their voting choice. In this
paper, we explore agent-based models for district-based elections, where we
consider each elector as an agent, and try to represent their social and
geographical attributes and political inclinations using probability
distributions. This model can be used to simulate election results by Monte
Carlo sampling. The models allow us to explore the full space of possible
outcomes of an electoral setting, though they can also be calibrated to actual
election results for suitable values of parameters. We use Approximate Bayesian
Computation (ABC) framework to estimate model parameters. We show that our
model can reproduce the results of elections held in India and USA, and can

1042,District-Fair Participatory Budgeting,"Participatory budgeting is a method used by city governments to select public
projects to fund based on residents' votes. Many cities use participatory
budgeting at a district level. Typically, a budget is divided among districts
proportionally to their population, and each district holds an election over
local projects and then uses its budget to fund the projects most preferred by
its voters. However, district-level participatory budgeting can yield poor
social welfare because it does not necessarily fund projects supported across
multiple districts. On the other hand, decision making that only takes global
social welfare into account can be unfair to districts: A
social-welfare-maximizing solution might not fund any of the projects preferred
by a district, despite the fact that its constituents pay taxes to the city.
Thus, we study how to fairly maximize social welfare in a participatory
budgeting setting with a single city-wide election. We propose a notion of
fairness that guarantees each district at least as much welfare as it would
have received in a district-level election. We show that, although optimizing
social welfare subject to this notion of fairness is NP-hard, we can
efficiently construct a lottery over welfare-optimal outcomes that is fair in
expectation. Moreover, we show that, when we are allowed to slightly relax
fairness, we can efficiently compute a fair solution that is
welfare-maximizing, but which may overspend the budget.",2102.06115v1,cs.GT,2021-02-11 16:55:57+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('D Ellis Hershkowitz'), arxiv.Result.Author('Anson Kahng'), arxiv.Result.Author('Dominik Peters'), arxiv.Result.Author('Ariel D. Procaccia')]",
1043,Electoral David vs Goliath: How does the Spatial Concentration of Electors affect District-based Elections?,"Many democratic countries use district-based elections where there is a
""seat"" for each district in the governing body. In each district, the party
whose candidate gets the maximum number of votes wins the corresponding seat.
The result of the election is decided based on the number of seats won by the
different parties. The electors (voters) can cast their votes only in the
district of their residence. Thus, locations of the electors and boundaries of
the districts may severely affect the election result even if the proportion of
popular support (number of electors) of different parties remains unchanged.
This has led to significant amount of research on whether the districts may be
redrawn or electors may be moved to maximize seats for a particular party. In
this paper, we frame the spatial distribution of electors in a probabilistic
setting, and explore different models to capture the intra-district
polarization of electors in favour of a party, or the spatial concentration of
supporters of different parties. Our models are inspired by elections in India,
where supporters of different parties tend to be concentrated in certain
districts. We show with extensive simulations that our model can capture
different statistical properties of real elections held in India. We frame
parameter estimation problems to fit our models to the observed election
results. Since analytical calculation of the likelihood functions are
infeasible for our complex models, we use Likelihood-free Inference methods
under the Approximate Bayesian Computation framework. Since this approach is
highly time-consuming, we explore how supervised regression using Logistic
Regression or Deep Neural Networks can be used to speed it up. We also explore
how the election results can change by varying the spatial distributions of the
voters, even when the proportions of popular support of the parties remain

1044,Exploring Fairness in District-based Multi-party Elections under different Voting Rules using Stochastic Simulations,"Many democratic societies use district-based elections, where the region
under consideration is geographically divided into districts and a
representative is chosen for each district based on the preferences of the
electors who reside there. These representatives belong to political parties,
and the executive powers are acquired by that party which has a majority of the
elected district representatives. In most systems, each elector can express
preference for one candidate, though they may have a complete or partial
ranking of the candidates/parties. We show that this can lead to situations
where many electors are dissatisfied with the election results, which is not
desirable in a democracy. The results may be biased towards the supporters of a
particular party, and against others. Inspired by current literature on
fairness of Machine Learning algorithms, we define measures of fairness to
quantify the satisfaction of electors, irrespective of their political choices.
We also consider alternative election policies using concepts of voting rules
and rank aggregation, to enable voters to express their detailed preferences
without making the electoral process cumbersome or opaque. We then evaluate
these policies using the aforementioned fairness measures with the help of
Monte Carlo simulations. Such simulations are obtained using a proposed
stochastic model for election simulation, that takes into account community
identities of electors and its role in influencing their residence and
political preferences. We show that this model can simulate actual multi-party
elections in India. Through extensive simulations, we find that allowing voters
to provide 2 preferences reduces the disparity between supporters of different
parties in terms of the election result.",2203.03720v1,cs.CY,2022-02-25 18:03:03+00:00,[arxiv.Result.Author('Adway Mitra')],

1046,Identifying Possible Winners in Ranked Choice Voting Elections with Outstanding Ballots,"Several election districts in the US have recently moved to ranked-choice
voting (RCV) to decide the results of local elections. RCV allows voters to
rank their choices, and the results are computed in rounds, eliminating one
candidate at a time. RCV ensures fairer elections and has been shown to
increase elected representation of women and people of color. A main drawback
of RCV is that the round-by-round process requires all the ballots to be
tallied before the results of an election can be calculated. With increasingly
large portions of ballots coming from absentee voters, RCV election outcomes
are not always apparent on election night, and can take several weeks to be
published, leading to a loss of trust in the electoral process from the public.
In this paper, we present an algorithm for efficiently computing possible
winners of RCV elections from partially known ballots and evaluate it on data
from the recent New York City Primary elections. We show that our techniques
allow to significantly narrow down the field of possible election winners, and
in some case identify the winner as soon as election night despite a number of

advantage to manipulate the outcome of an election. In particular, we study
district-based elections with two candidates, in which the winner of the
election is the candidate that wins in the majority of the districts.
District-based elections are adopted worldwide (e.g., UK and USA) and are a
natural extension of widely studied voting mechanisms (e.g., k-voting and
plurality voting). We resort to the Bayesian persuasion framework, where the
manipulator (sender) strategically discloses information to the voters
(receivers) that update their beliefs rationally. We study both private
signaling, in which the sender can use a private communication channel per
receiver, and public signaling, in which the sender can use a single
communication channel for all the receivers. Furthermore, for the first time,
we introduce semi-public signaling in which the sender can use a single
communication channel per district. We show that there is a sharp distinction
between private and (semi-)public signaling. In particular, optimal private
signaling schemes can provide an arbitrarily better probability of victory than
(semi-)public ones and can be computed efficiently, while optimal (semi-)public
signaling schemes cannot be approximated to within any factor in polynomial
time unless P=NP. However, we show that reasonable relaxations allow the design
of multi-criteria PTASs for optimal (semi-)public signaling schemes. In doing
so, we introduce a novel property, namely comparative stability, and we design
a bi-criteria PTAS for public signaling in general Bayesian persuasion problems

single-member voting district plans for a hypothetical city council election. A
fair district plan is defined as one where the number of minority-majority
districts is proportional to the city-wide minority population. Thus each city
is summarized by three traits: minority percent, a measure of segregation, and
availability of a fair district plan. We find that when the minority population
is around 25%-33%, there is a positive correlation between the degree of
segregation and the availability of proportional district plan. Consistently,
when the minority population lives in a more diffuse residential pattern, there
are fewer available proportional district plans. Finally, we develop a new

non-negative integer) to each political party. The count indicates the number
of previously lost districts which that party potentially could have had a 50%
chance of winning, without risking any currently won districts, by making
reasonable changes to the input map. We then analyze GEO metric scores for each

empirically test this prediction, I compile one of the most comprehensive
datasets to date on the political careers of all district attorneys in office
during the steepest rise in incarceration in U.S. history (roughly 1986-2006).
Using quasi-experimental methods, I find causal evidence that being in a DA
election year increases total admissions per capita and total months sentenced
per capita. I estimate that the election year effects on admissions are akin to
moving 0.85 standard deviations along the distribution of DA behavior within
state (e.g., going from the 50th to 80th percentile in sentencing intensity). I
find evidence that election effects are larger (1) when DA elections are
contested, (2) in Republican counties, and (3) in the southern United
States--all these factors are consistent with the perspective that election
effects arise from political incentives influencing DAs. Further, I find that
district attorney election effects decline over the period 1986-2006, in tandem

briber. The briber needs to compute if the given partition can be modified so
that (i) the favorite alternative of the briber wins the resulting election,
(ii) the modification is budget feasible, and (iii) every new district is
connected. We study four natural variants of the above problem -- the graph on
voter being arbitrary vs complete graph (corresponds to removing connectedness
requirement for districts) and the cost of bribing every voter being uniform vs
non-uniform. We show that all the four problems are NP-complete even under

year presidential term. For the 2018 midterms, 35 senators and all the 435
seats in the House of Representatives were up for re-election, thus, every
congressional district and practically every state had a federal election. In
order to collect election related tweets, we analyzed Twitter during the month
prior to, and the two weeks following, the November 6, 2018 election day. In a
targeted analysis to detect statistical anomalies or election interference, we
identified several biases that can lead to wrong conclusions. Specifically, we
looked for divergence between actual voting outcomes and instances of the
#ivoted hashtag on the election day. This analysis highlighted three states of
concern: New York, California, and Texas. We repeated our analysis discarding
malicious accounts, such as social bots. Upon further inspection and against a
backdrop of collected general election-related tweets, we identified some
confounding factors, such as population bias, or bot and political ideology
inference, that can lead to false conclusions. We conclude by providing an
in-depth discussion of the perils and challenges of using social media data to
explore questions about election manipulation.",1902.00043v1,cs.SI,2019-01-31 19:23:10+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Ashok Deb'), arxiv.Result.Author('Luca Luceri'), arxiv.Result.Author('Adam Badawy'), arxiv.Result.Author('Emilio Ferrara')]",

1060,Sampling-Based Winner Prediction in District-Based Elections,"In a district-based election, we apply a voting rule $r$ to decide the
winners in each district, and a candidate who wins in a maximum number of
districts is the winner of the election. We present efficient sampling-based
algorithms to predict the winner of such district-based election systems in
this paper. When $r$ is plurality and the margin of victory is known to be at
least $\varepsilon$ fraction of the total population, we present an algorithm
to predict the winner. The sample complexity of our algorithm is
$\mathcal{O}\left(\frac{1}{\varepsilon^4}\log
\frac{1}{\varepsilon}\log\frac{1}{\delta}\right)$. We complement this result by
proving that any algorithm, from a natural class of algorithms, for predicting
the winner in a district-based election when $r$ is plurality, must sample at
least $\Omega\left(\frac{1}{\varepsilon^4}\log\frac{1}{\delta}\right)$ votes.
We then extend this result to any voting rule $r$. Loosely speaking, we show
that we can predict the winner of a district-based election with an extra
overhead of
$\mathcal{O}\left(\frac{1}{\varepsilon^2}\log\frac{1}{\delta}\right)$ over the
sample complexity of predicting the single-district winner under $r$. We
further extend our algorithm for the case when the margin of victory is
unknown, but we have only two candidates. We then consider the median voting
rule when the set of preferences in each district is single-peaked. We show
that the winner of a district-based election can be predicted with
$\mathcal{O}\left(\frac{1}{\varepsilon^4}\log\frac{1}{\varepsilon}\log\frac{1}{\delta}\right)$
samples even when the harmonious order in different districts can be different
and even unknown. Finally, we also show some results for estimating the margin
of victory of a district-based election within both additive and multiplicative
error bounds.",2203.00083v1,cs.AI,2022-02-28 20:32:48+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Palash Dey'), arxiv.Result.Author('Debajyoti Kar'), arxiv.Result.Author('Swagato Sanyal')]",
1061,Agent-based Simulation of District-based Elections,"In district-based elections, electors cast votes in their respective
districts. In each district, the party with maximum votes wins the
corresponding seat in the governing body. The election result is based on the
number of seats won by different parties. In this system, locations of electors
across the districts may severely affect the election result even if the total
number of votes obtained by different parties remains unchanged. A less popular
party may end up winning more seats if their supporters are suitably
distributed spatially. This happens due to various regional and social
influences on individual voters which modulate their voting choice. In this
paper, we explore agent-based models for district-based elections, where we
consider each elector as an agent, and try to represent their social and
geographical attributes and political inclinations using probability
distributions. This model can be used to simulate election results by Monte
Carlo sampling. The models allow us to explore the full space of possible
outcomes of an electoral setting, though they can also be calibrated to actual
election results for suitable values of parameters. We use Approximate Bayesian
Computation (ABC) framework to estimate model parameters. We show that our
model can reproduce the results of elections held in India and USA, and can
also produce counterfactual scenarios.",2205.14400v1,cs.MA,2022-05-28 11:19:04+00:00,[arxiv.Result.Author('Adway Mitra')],
1062,District-Fair Participatory Budgeting,"Participatory budgeting is a method used by city governments to select public
projects to fund based on residents' votes. Many cities use participatory
budgeting at a district level. Typically, a budget is divided among districts
proportionally to their population, and each district holds an election over
local projects and then uses its budget to fund the projects most preferred by
its voters. However, district-level participatory budgeting can yield poor
social welfare because it does not necessarily fund projects supported across
multiple districts. On the other hand, decision making that only takes global
social welfare into account can be unfair to districts: A
social-welfare-maximizing solution might not fund any of the projects preferred
by a district, despite the fact that its constituents pay taxes to the city.
Thus, we study how to fairly maximize social welfare in a participatory
budgeting setting with a single city-wide election. We propose a notion of
fairness that guarantees each district at least as much welfare as it would
have received in a district-level election. We show that, although optimizing
social welfare subject to this notion of fairness is NP-hard, we can
efficiently construct a lottery over welfare-optimal outcomes that is fair in
expectation. Moreover, we show that, when we are allowed to slightly relax
fairness, we can efficiently compute a fair solution that is
welfare-maximizing, but which may overspend the budget.",2102.06115v1,cs.GT,2021-02-11 16:55:57+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('D Ellis Hershkowitz'), arxiv.Result.Author('Anson Kahng'), arxiv.Result.Author('Dominik Peters'), arxiv.Result.Author('Ariel D. Procaccia')]",
1063,Electoral David vs Goliath: How does the Spatial Concentration of Electors affect District-based Elections?,"Many democratic countries use district-based elections where there is a
""seat"" for each district in the governing body. In each district, the party
whose candidate gets the maximum number of votes wins the corresponding seat.
The result of the election is decided based on the number of seats won by the
different parties. The electors (voters) can cast their votes only in the
district of their residence. Thus, locations of the electors and boundaries of
the districts may severely affect the election result even if the proportion of
popular support (number of electors) of different parties remains unchanged.
This has led to significant amount of research on whether the districts may be
redrawn or electors may be moved to maximize seats for a particular party. In
this paper, we frame the spatial distribution of electors in a probabilistic
setting, and explore different models to capture the intra-district
polarization of electors in favour of a party, or the spatial concentration of
supporters of different parties. Our models are inspired by elections in India,
where supporters of different parties tend to be concentrated in certain
districts. We show with extensive simulations that our model can capture
different statistical properties of real elections held in India. We frame
parameter estimation problems to fit our models to the observed election
results. Since analytical calculation of the likelihood functions are
infeasible for our complex models, we use Likelihood-free Inference methods
under the Approximate Bayesian Computation framework. Since this approach is
highly time-consuming, we explore how supervised regression using Logistic
Regression or Deep Neural Networks can be used to speed it up. We also explore
how the election results can change by varying the spatial distributions of the
voters, even when the proportions of popular support of the parties remain
constant.",2006.11865v1,stat.AP,2020-06-21 18:17:57+00:00,[arxiv.Result.Author('Adway Mitra')],
1064,Exploring Fairness in District-based Multi-party Elections under different Voting Rules using Stochastic Simulations,"Many democratic societies use district-based elections, where the region
under consideration is geographically divided into districts and a
representative is chosen for each district based on the preferences of the
electors who reside there. These representatives belong to political parties,
and the executive powers are acquired by that party which has a majority of the
elected district representatives. In most systems, each elector can express
preference for one candidate, though they may have a complete or partial
ranking of the candidates/parties. We show that this can lead to situations
where many electors are dissatisfied with the election results, which is not
desirable in a democracy. The results may be biased towards the supporters of a
particular party, and against others. Inspired by current literature on
fairness of Machine Learning algorithms, we define measures of fairness to
quantify the satisfaction of electors, irrespective of their political choices.
We also consider alternative election policies using concepts of voting rules
and rank aggregation, to enable voters to express their detailed preferences
without making the electoral process cumbersome or opaque. We then evaluate
these policies using the aforementioned fairness measures with the help of
Monte Carlo simulations. Such simulations are obtained using a proposed
stochastic model for election simulation, that takes into account community
identities of electors and its role in influencing their residence and
political preferences. We show that this model can simulate actual multi-party
elections in India. Through extensive simulations, we find that allowing voters
to provide 2 preferences reduces the disparity between supporters of different
parties in terms of the election result.",2203.03720v1,cs.CY,2022-02-25 18:03:03+00:00,[arxiv.Result.Author('Adway Mitra')],

1066,Identifying Possible Winners in Ranked Choice Voting Elections with Outstanding Ballots,"Several election districts in the US have recently moved to ranked-choice
voting (RCV) to decide the results of local elections. RCV allows voters to
rank their choices, and the results are computed in rounds, eliminating one
candidate at a time. RCV ensures fairer elections and has been shown to
increase elected representation of women and people of color. A main drawback
of RCV is that the round-by-round process requires all the ballots to be
tallied before the results of an election can be calculated. With increasingly
large portions of ballots coming from absentee voters, RCV election outcomes
are not always apparent on election night, and can take several weeks to be
published, leading to a loss of trust in the electoral process from the public.
In this paper, we present an algorithm for efficiently computing possible
winners of RCV elections from partially known ballots and evaluate it on data
from the recent New York City Primary elections. We show that our techniques
allow to significantly narrow down the field of possible election winners, and
in some case identify the winner as soon as election night despite a number of

1067,Persuading Voters in District-based Elections,"We focus on the scenario in which an agent can exploit his information
advantage to manipulate the outcome of an election. In particular, we study
district-based elections with two candidates, in which the winner of the
election is the candidate that wins in the majority of the districts.
District-based elections are adopted worldwide (e.g., UK and USA) and are a
natural extension of widely studied voting mechanisms (e.g., k-voting and
plurality voting). We resort to the Bayesian persuasion framework, where the
manipulator (sender) strategically discloses information to the voters
(receivers) that update their beliefs rationally. We study both private
signaling, in which the sender can use a private communication channel per
receiver, and public signaling, in which the sender can use a single
communication channel for all the receivers. Furthermore, for the first time,
we introduce semi-public signaling in which the sender can use a single
communication channel per district. We show that there is a sharp distinction
between private and (semi-)public signaling. In particular, optimal private
signaling schemes can provide an arbitrarily better probability of victory than
(semi-)public ones and can be computed efficiently, while optimal (semi-)public
signaling schemes cannot be approximated to within any factor in polynomial
time unless P=NP. However, we show that reasonable relaxations allow the design
of multi-criteria PTASs for optimal (semi-)public signaling schemes. In doing
so, we introduce a novel property, namely comparative stability, and we design
a bi-criteria PTAS for public signaling in general Bayesian persuasion problems

their residential segregation patterns. Of these, 1200 are modeled on existing
cities, and 3000 are rectangular grid cities. In each city, we consider
single-member voting district plans for a hypothetical city council election. A
fair district plan is defined as one where the number of minority-majority
districts is proportional to the city-wide minority population. Thus each city
is summarized by three traits: minority percent, a measure of segregation, and
availability of a fair district plan. We find that when the minority population
is around 25%-33%, there is a positive correlation between the degree of
segregation and the availability of proportional district plan. Consistently,
when the minority population lives in a more diffuse residential pattern, there
are fewer available proportional district plans. Finally, we develop a new
method to validate runtime and sample size of an ensemble of district plans

biased way of partitioning the state into electoral districts such that based
on a priori knowledge it has more chances to win in a maximum possible number
of districts. In this paper, we propose a new methodology for deciding whether

non-negative integer) to each political party. The count indicates the number
of previously lost districts which that party potentially could have had a 50%
chance of winning, without risking any currently won districts, by making
reasonable changes to the input map. We then analyze GEO metric scores for each

empirically test this prediction, I compile one of the most comprehensive
datasets to date on the political careers of all district attorneys in office
during the steepest rise in incarceration in U.S. history (roughly 1986-2006).
Using quasi-experimental methods, I find causal evidence that being in a DA
election year increases total admissions per capita and total months sentenced
per capita. I estimate that the election year effects on admissions are akin to
moving 0.85 standard deviations along the distribution of DA behavior within
state (e.g., going from the 50th to 80th percentile in sentencing intensity). I
find evidence that election effects are larger (1) when DA elections are
contested, (2) in Republican counties, and (3) in the southern United
States--all these factors are consistent with the perspective that election
effects arise from political incentives influencing DAs. Further, I find that
district attorney election effects decline over the period 1986-2006, in tandem

findings suggest DA behavior may respond to voter preferences--in particular to

briber. The briber needs to compute if the given partition can be modified so
that (i) the favorite alternative of the briber wins the resulting election,
(ii) the modification is budget feasible, and (iii) every new district is
connected. We study four natural variants of the above problem -- the graph on
voter being arbitrary vs complete graph (corresponds to removing connectedness
requirement for districts) and the cost of bribing every voter being uniform vs
non-uniform. We show that all the four problems are NP-complete even under

1082,Understanding Political Agreements and Disagreements: Evidence from the 2022 French Presidential Election,"Since the seminal works of Condorcet and Borda, social choice theory has
explored how to aggregate individual preferences into collective decisions.
Yet, social choice theory has focused primarily on identifying winners in
elections involving few candidates, leaving questions about direct
participation on multiple issues relatively unexplored. Here we analyze data
collected in a direct participation experiment where people built their own
government programs using 120 proposals from the candidates of the 2022 French
presidential. We find that in this setting it is useful to introduce a measure
of ""divisiveness,"" which can be constructed for any voting rule, is orthogonal
to them, and helps identify polarizing proposals. We show that divisiveness
captures fragmentation across multiple dimensions (sex, age, political

1083,A model of conflict and leadership: Is there a hawkish drift in politics?,"We analyze conflict between a citizenry and an insurgent group over a fixed
resource such as land. The citizenry has an elected leader who proposes a
division such that, the lower the land ceded to the insurgents, the higher the
cost of conflict. Leaders differ in ability and ideology such that the higher
the leader's ability, the lower the cost of conflict, and the more hawkish the
leader, the higher his utility from retaining land. We show that the conflict
arises from the political process with re-election motives causing leaders to
choose to cede too little land to signal their ability. We also show that when
the rents of office are high, the political equilibrium and the second best
diverge; in particular, the policy under the political equilibrium is more
hawkish compared to the second best. When both ideology and ability are
unknown, we provide a plausible condition under which the probability of
re-election increases in the leader's hawkishness, thereby providing an
explanation for why hawkish politicians may have a natural advantage under the

consequences all over the world. Today, we know that a minority of social bots,

1090,Identifying Possible Winners in Ranked Choice Voting Elections with Outstanding Ballots,"Several election districts in the US have recently moved to ranked-choice
voting (RCV) to decide the results of local elections. RCV allows voters to
rank their choices, and the results are computed in rounds, eliminating one
candidate at a time. RCV ensures fairer elections and has been shown to
increase elected representation of women and people of color. A main drawback
of RCV is that the round-by-round process requires all the ballots to be
tallied before the results of an election can be calculated. With increasingly
large portions of ballots coming from absentee voters, RCV election outcomes
are not always apparent on election night, and can take several weeks to be
published, leading to a loss of trust in the electoral process from the public.
In this paper, we present an algorithm for efficiently computing possible
winners of RCV elections from partially known ballots and evaluate it on data
from the recent New York City Primary elections. We show that our techniques
allow to significantly narrow down the field of possible election winners, and
in some case identify the winner as soon as election night despite a number of

1092,On Microtargeting Socially Divisive Ads: A Case Study of Russia-Linked Ad Campaigns on Facebook,"Targeted advertising is meant to improve the efficiency of matching
advertisers to their customers. However, targeted advertising can also be
abused by malicious advertisers to efficiently reach people susceptible to
false stories, stoke grievances, and incite social conflict. Since targeted ads

likely to go unreported and their effects undetected. This work examines a
specific case of malicious advertising, exploring the extent to which political
ads from the Russian Intelligence Research Agency (IRA) run prior to 2016 U.S.
elections exploited Facebook's targeted advertising infrastructure to
efficiently target ads on divisive or polarizing topics (e.g., immigration,
race-based policing) at vulnerable sub-populations. In particular, we do the
following: (a) We conduct U.S. census-representative surveys to characterize
how users with different political ideologies report, approve, and perceive
truth in the content of the IRA ads. Our surveys show that many ads are
""divisive"": they elicit very different reactions from people belonging to
different socially salient groups. (b) We characterize how these divisive ads
are targeted to sub-populations that feel particularly aggrieved by the status
quo. Our findings support existing calls for greater transparency of content
and targeting of political ads. (c) We particularly focus on how the Facebook
ad API facilitates such targeting. We show how the enormous amount of personal

argue that these unexpressed negativities are the predominant source of
polarization in politics. I propose a voting scheme with an explicit expression
of these negative preferences, so that we can simultaneously decipher the

autonomously identifies the replica that minimizes the average cluster response
time, using prediction models trained dynamically at runtime. To balance the
exploration and exploitation, SEER explores replicas' performance and updates
their prediction models only after detecting significant system changes. We
evaluate SEER in a traffic management scenario comprising [3..7] Raft replicas,
and well-known data-center and WAN topologies. Compared to the Raft's uniform
leader election, SEER decreases the mean control plane response time by up to

most prominently for State Elections in Victoria (2014), New South Wales (2015)
and Western Australia (2017), along with trials of electronic voting systems in
federal elections in 2007.
  This thesis presents an analysis of the iVote electronic voting system used
for the 2017 Western Australian State Election (iVote WA), outlining a number
of security risks introduced by the use of cloud-based distributed denial of
service mitigation. In addition, this thesis presents the results of a
cross-sectional survey of Australian voters regarding levels of trust for three
voting systems: the existing paper-based system used for Australian federal
elections, the iVote WA system, and the vVote system used for the 2014
Victorian State Election.
  The analysis of iVote, combined with the survey results, are used to inform a
recommendation for future research and public policy regarding the use of
electronic voting systems in Australian federal elections.",1805.02202v1,cs.CR,2018-05-06 12:41:10+00:00,[arxiv.Result.Author('Mark Eldridge')],
1108,"Complexity of Manipulation, Bribery, and Campaign Management in Bucklin and Fallback Voting","A central theme in computational social choice is to study the extent to
which voting systems computationally resist manipulative attacks seeking to
influence the outcome of elections, such as manipulation (i.e., strategic
voting), control, and bribery. Bucklin and fallback voting are among the voting
systems with the broadest resistance (i.e., NP-hardness) to control attacks.
However, only little is known about their behavior regarding manipulation and
bribery attacks. We comprehensively investigate the computational resistance of
Bucklin and fallback voting for many of the common manipulation and bribery
scenarios; we also complement our discussion by considering several campaign

1111,Perils and Challenges of Social Media and Election Manipulation Analysis: The 2018 US Midterms,"One of the hallmarks of a free and fair society is the ability to conduct a
peaceful and seamless transfer of power from one leader to another.
Democratically, this is measured in a citizen population's trust in the
electoral system of choosing a representative government. In view of the well
documented issues of the 2016 US Presidential election, we conducted an
in-depth analysis of the 2018 US Midterm elections looking specifically for
voter fraud or suppression. The Midterm election occurs in the middle of a 4
year presidential term. For the 2018 midterms, 35 senators and all the 435
seats in the House of Representatives were up for re-election, thus, every
congressional district and practically every state had a federal election. In
order to collect election related tweets, we analyzed Twitter during the month
prior to, and the two weeks following, the November 6, 2018 election day. In a
targeted analysis to detect statistical anomalies or election interference, we
identified several biases that can lead to wrong conclusions. Specifically, we
looked for divergence between actual voting outcomes and instances of the
#ivoted hashtag on the election day. This analysis highlighted three states of
concern: New York, California, and Texas. We repeated our analysis discarding
malicious accounts, such as social bots. Upon further inspection and against a
backdrop of collected general election-related tweets, we identified some
confounding factors, such as population bias, or bot and political ideology
inference, that can lead to false conclusions. We conclude by providing an
in-depth discussion of the perils and challenges of using social media data to

behavior at a large scale. In proportional elections with open lists, the

the country and the year of the election. Here we provide the first thorough
assessment of this claim. We analyzed election datasets of 15 countries with
proportional systems. We confirm that a class of nations with similar election
rules fulfill the universality claim. Discrepancies from this trend in other
countries with open-lists elections are always associated with peculiar
differences in the election rules, which matter more than differences between
countries and historical periods. Our analysis shows that the role of parties
in the electoral performance of candidates is crucial: alternative scalings not
taking into account party affiliations lead to poor results.",1212.2142v2,physics.soc-ph,2012-12-10 17:26:06+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Arnab Chatterjee'), arxiv.Result.Author('Marija Mitrović'), arxiv.Result.Author('Santo Fortunato')]","Scientific Reports 3, 1049 (2013)"

ballot box losses) throw the election result into doubt---requiring a costly
repeat election---or can be safely ignored. In this paper, we present

one parliamentary seat was decided by a margin much smaller than the number of

of undesirable behavior among agents, such as control, manipulation, and
bribery in election systems. These kinds of voting strategies are often
tempting at the individual level but disastrous for the agents as a whole.
Creating election systems where the determination of such strategies is
difficult is thus an important goal.
  An interesting set of elections is that of scoring protocols. Previous work
in this area has demonstrated the complexity of misuse in cases involving a
fixed number of candidates, and of specific election systems on unbounded
number of candidates such as Borda. In contrast, we take the first step in
generalizing the results of computational complexity of election misuse to
cases of infinitely many scoring protocols on an unbounded number of
candidates. Interesting families of systems include $k$-approval and $k$-veto
elections, in which voters distinguish $k$ candidates from the candidate set.
  Our main result is to partition the problems of these families based on their
complexity. We do so by showing they are polynomial-time computable, NP-hard,
or polynomial-time equivalent to another problem of interest. We also
demonstrate a surprising connection between manipulation in election systems

state databases containing information about which citizens are eligible to
vote. Administrators at the state and local level are faced with the
exceedingly difficult task of ensuring that each of their jurisdictions is
properly managed, while also monitoring for improper modifications to the
database. Monitoring changes to Voter Registration Files (VRFs) is crucial,
given that a malicious actor wishing to disrupt the democratic process in the
US would be well-advised to manipulate the contents of these files in order to
achieve their goals. In 2020, we saw election officials perform admirably when
faced with administering one of the most contentious elections in US history,
but much work remains to secure and monitor the election systems Americans rely
on. Using data created by comparing snapshots taken of VRFs over time, we
present a set of methods that make use of machine learning to ease the burden
on analysts and administrators in protecting voter rolls. We first evaluate the
effectiveness of multiple unsupervised anomaly detection methods in detecting
VRF modifications by modeling anomalous changes as sparse additive noise. In
this setting we determine that statistical models comparing administrative
districts within a short time span and non-negative matrix factorization are
most effective for surfacing anomalous events for review. These methods were
deployed during 2019-2020 in our organization's monitoring system and were used
in collaboration with the office of the Iowa Secretary of State. Additionally,
we propose a newly deployed model which uses historical and demographic
metadata to label the likely root cause of database modifications. We hope to
use this model to predict which modifications have known causes and therefore
better identify potentially anomalous modifications.",2106.15285v1,cs.CR,2021-06-16 21:48:31+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Sam Royston'), arxiv.Result.Author('Ben Greenberg'), arxiv.Result.Author('Omeed Tavasoli'), arxiv.Result.Author('Courtenay Cotton')]",
1119,High-Multiplicity Election Problems,"The computational study of elections generally assumes that the preferences
of the electorate come in as a list of votes. Depending on the context, it may
be much more natural to represent the list succinctly, as the distinct votes of
the electorate and their counts, i.e., high-multiplicity representation. We
consider how this representation affects the complexity of election problems.
High-multiplicity representation may be exponentially smaller than standard
representation, and so many polynomial-time algorithms for election problems in
standard representation become exponential-time. Surprisingly, for
polynomial-time election problems, we are often able to either adapt the same
approach or provide new algorithms to show that these problems remain
polynomial-time in the high-multiplicity case; this is in sharp contrast to the
case where each voter has a weight, where the complexity usually increases. In
the process we explore the relationship between high-multiplicity scheduling
and manipulation of high-multiplicity elections. And we show that for any fixed
set of job lengths, high-multiplicity scheduling on uniform parallel machines
is in P, which was previously known for only two job lengths. We did not find
any natural case where a polynomial-time election problem does not remain in P
when moving to high-multiplicity representation. However, we found one natural
NP-hard election problem where the complexity does increase, namely winner
determination for Kemeny elections.",1611.08927v5,cs.GT,2016-11-27 22:39:53+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Zack Fitzsimmons'), arxiv.Result.Author('Edith Hemaspaandra')]",

Threshold-encryption, which is used to implement the quorum, prevents a
deadlock from occurring if a minority of candidates or observers tries to
sabotage the election. Candidates and observers can indicate that the election
was free and fair by exposing their keys, which are used by the system to
decrypt each vote. Ballot sheets are encrypted by onion-routing, which has a
layer with the key of the election instance, so it's impossible for a quorum to
decode the results before they have announced their decision by exposing their
keys. A register of voters ensures that only verified voters can vote without
compromising their identity. If there any doubts about the identity of a voter,
their vote can be excluded from the election, if a quorum agrees. This system
is designed to scale from one instance to a distributed system that runs over
an unlimited number of instances, which can be achieved using cloud instances
or smartphones belonging to voters or tellers.",2011.10902v2,cs.CR,2020-11-22 00:58:34+00:00,[arxiv.Result.Author('Kirill A. Korinsky')],
1125,An Information-theoretical Secured Byzantine-fault Tolerance Consensus in Quantum Key Distribution Network,"Quantum key distribution (QKD) networks is expected to provide
information-theoretical secured (ITS) communication over long distances. QKD
networks based trusted relay architecture are now the most widely used scheme
in practice. However, it is an unrealistic assumption that all relays are fully
trustable in complex networks. In the past, only a few studies have
theoretically analyzed the case of passive eavesdropping attack by dishonest
relays and corresponding defense method. However, we have found that active
attacks by dishonest relays can be more threatening. With the consideration of
passive and active attacks, we treat dishonest relays as Byzantine nodes and
analyzes the upper limit of Byzantine nodes that the QKD network can
accommodate. In this paper, we propose an ITS Byzantine-fault tolerance (BFT)
QKD network scheme to achieve end-to-end key distribution based on
point-to-point QKD links. To ensure consistency and provide BFT ability in the
QKD network, we design an ITSBFT-consensus protocol for this network scheme. To
ensure the information-theoretic security of consensus, we design a temporary
signature scheme based on point-to-point QKD link keys. To prevent Byzantine
nodes from disrupting the execution process of key distribution, we design an
end-to-end key distribution scheme combined with consensus. We theoretically
analyze proposed ITSBFT-QKD network scheme from four aspects: QKD key
distribution security, temporary signature security, consensus security, and

1127,Signature Correction Attack on Dilithium Signature Scheme,"Motivated by the rise of quantum computers, existing public-key cryptosystems
are expected to be replaced by post-quantum schemes in the next decade in
billions of devices. To facilitate the transition, NIST is running a
standardization process which is currently in its final Round. Only three
digital signature schemes are left in the competition, among which Dilithium
and Falcon are the ones based on lattices. Classical fault attacks on signature
schemes make use of pairs of faulty and correct signatures to recover the
secret key which only works on deterministic schemes. To counter such attacks,
Dilithium offers a randomized version which makes each signature unique, even
when signing identical messages.
  In this work, we introduce a novel Signature Correction Attack which not only
applies to the deterministic version but also to the randomized version of
Dilithium and is effective even on constant-time implementations using AVX2
instructions. The Signature Correction Attack exploits the mathematical
structure of Dilithium to recover the secret key bits by using faulty
signatures and the public-key. It can work for any fault mechanism which can
induce single bit-flips. For demonstration, we are using Rowhammer induced
faults. Thus, our attack does not require any physical access or special
privileges, and hence could be also implemented on shared cloud servers. We
perform a thorough classical and quantum security analysis of Dilithium and
successfully recover 1,851 bits out of 3,072 bits of secret key $s_1$ for
security level 2. The lattice strength against quantum attackers is reduced
from $2^{128}$ to $2^{81}$ while the strength against classical attackers is
reduced from $2^{141}$ to $2^{89}$. Hence, the Signature Correction Attack may
be employed to achieve a practical attack on Dilithium (security level 2) as

requires voters to rank candidates in order of preference, and uses a counting
algorithm that is more complex than systems such as first-past-the-post or
scoring rules. An even more complex system, the single transferable vote (STV),
is used when multiple candidates need to be elected. The complexity of these
systems has made it difficult to audit the election outcomes. There is
currently no known risk-limiting audit (RLA) method for STV, other than a full
manual count of the ballots.
  A new approach to auditing these systems was recently proposed, based on a
Dirichlet-tree model. We present a detailed analysis of this approach for
ballot-polling Bayesian audits of IRV elections. We compared several choices
for the prior distribution, including some approaches using a Bayesian
bootstrap (equivalent to an improper prior). Our findings include that the
bootstrap-based approaches can be adapted to perform similarly to a full
Bayesian model in practice, and that an overly informative prior can give
counter-intuitive results. Via carefully chosen examples, we show why creating
an RLA with this model is challenging, but we also suggest ways to overcome

transient faults, as it guarantees that even in the presence of such faults,
the system will recover to states where it satisfies its specification. One of
the desirable attributes of stabilization is the use of bounded space for each

program that uses variables with unbounded domain into a stabilizing program
that uses bounded variables and (practically bounded) physical time. While
non-stabilizing programs (that do not handle transient faults) can deal with
unbounded variables by assigning large enough but bounded space, stabilizing
programs that need to deal with arbitrary transient faults cannot do the same
since a transient fault may corrupt the variable to its maximum value. We show
that our transformation algorithm is applicable to several problems including
logical clocks, vector clocks, mutual exclusion, leader election, diffusing
computations, Paxos based consensus, and so on. Moreover, our approach can also
be used to bound counters used in an earlier work by Katz and Perry for adding
stabilization to a non-stabilizing program. By combining our algorithm with

information-theoretical secured (ITS) communication over long distances. QKD
networks based trusted relay architecture are now the most widely used scheme
in practice. However, it is an unrealistic assumption that all relays are fully
trustable in complex networks. In the past, only a few studies have
theoretically analyzed the case of passive eavesdropping attack by dishonest
relays and corresponding defense method. However, we have found that active
attacks by dishonest relays can be more threatening. With the consideration of
passive and active attacks, we treat dishonest relays as Byzantine nodes and
analyzes the upper limit of Byzantine nodes that the QKD network can
accommodate. In this paper, we propose an ITS Byzantine-fault tolerance (BFT)
QKD network scheme to achieve end-to-end key distribution based on
point-to-point QKD links. To ensure consistency and provide BFT ability in the
QKD network, we design an ITSBFT-consensus protocol for this network scheme. To
ensure the information-theoretic security of consensus, we design a temporary
signature scheme based on point-to-point QKD link keys. To prevent Byzantine
nodes from disrupting the execution process of key distribution, we design an
end-to-end key distribution scheme combined with consensus. We theoretically

layer with the key of the election instance, so it's impossible for a quorum to
decode the results before they have announced their decision by exposing their
keys. A register of voters ensures that only verified voters can vote without
compromising their identity. If there any doubts about the identity of a voter,
their vote can be excluded from the election, if a quorum agrees. This system

1154,Sparse Choice Models,"Choice models, which capture popular preferences over objects of interest,
play a key role in making decisions whose eventual outcome is impacted by human
choice behavior. In most scenarios, the choice model, which can effectively be
viewed as a distribution over permutations, must be learned from observed data.
The observed data, in turn, may frequently be viewed as (partial, noisy)
information about marginals of this distribution over permutations. As such,
the search for an appropriate choice model boils down to learning a
distribution over permutations that is (near-)consistent with observed
information about this distribution.
  In this work, we pursue a non-parametric approach which seeks to learn a
choice model (i.e. a distribution over permutations) with {\em sparsest}
possible support, and consistent with observed data. We assume that the data
observed consists of noisy information pertaining to the marginals of the
choice model we seek to learn. We establish that {\em any} choice model admits
a `very' sparse approximation in the sense that there exists a choice model
whose support is small relative to the dimension of the observed data and whose
marginals approximately agree with the observed marginal information. We
further show that under, what we dub, `signature' conditions, such a sparse
approximation can be found in a computationally efficiently fashion relative to
a brute force approach. An empirical study using the American Psychological
Association election data-set suggests that our approach manages to unearth
useful structural properties of the underlying choice model using the sparse
approximation found. Our results further suggest that the signature condition
is a potential alternative to the recently popularized Restricted Null Space
condition for efficient recovery of sparse models.",1011.4339v2,stat.ME,2010-11-19 03:51:01+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Vivek F. Farias'), arxiv.Result.Author('Srikanth Jagabathula'), arxiv.Result.Author('Devavrat Shah')]",

1163,Estonian Voting Verification Mechanism Revisited,"After the Estonian Parliamentary Elections held in 2011, an additional
verification mechanism was integrated into the i-voting system in order to
resist corrupted voting devices, including the so called Student's Attack where
a student practically showed that the voting system is indeed not verifiable by
developing several versions of malware capable of blocking or even changing the
vote. This mechanism gives voters the opportunity to verify whether the vote
they cast is stored in the central system correctly. However, the verification
phase ends by displaying the cast vote in plain form on the verification
device. In other words, the device on which the verification is done learns the
voter's choice. In this work, our aim is to investigate this verification phase
in detail and to point out that leaking the voter's choice to the verification
application may harm the voter privacy. Additionally, when applied in a wide
range, this would even compromise the fairness and the overall secrecy of the
elections. In this respect, we propose an alternative verification mechanism
for the Estonian i-voting system to overcome this vulnerability. Not only is
the proposed mechanism secure and resistant against corrupted verification
devices, so does it successfully verify whether the vote is correctly stored in
the system. We also highlight that our proposed mechanism brings only symmetric
encryptions and hash functions on the verification device, thereby mitigating
these weaknesses in an efficient way with a negligible cost. More concretely,
it brings only $m$ additional symmetric key decryptions to the verification
device, where $m$ denoting the number of candidates. Finally, we prove the
security of the proposed verification mechanism and compare the cost complexity

1165,Verification of the Socio-Technical Aspects of Voting: The Case of the Polish Postal Vote 2020,"Voting procedures are designed and implemented by people, for people, and
with significant human involvement. Thus, one should take into account the
human factors in order to comprehensively analyze properties of an election and
detect threats. In particular, it is essential to assess how actions and
strategies of the involved agents (voters, municipal office employees, mail
clerks) can influence the outcome of other agents' actions as well as the
overall outcome of the election. In this paper, we present our first attempt to
capture those aspects in a formal multi-agent model of the Polish presidential
election 2020. The election marked the first time when postal vote was
universally available in Poland. Unfortunately, the voting scheme was prepared
under time pressure and political pressure, and without the involvement of
experts. This might have opened up possibilities for various kinds of ballot

1168,A verifiably secure and proportional committee election rule,"The property of proportional representation in approval-based committee
elections has appeared in the social choice literature for over a century, and
is typically understood as avoiding the underrepresentation of minorities.
However, we argue that the security of some distributed systems is directly
linked to the opposite goal of avoiding the overrepresentation of any minority,
a goal not previously formalized that leads us to an optimization objective
known as maximin support. After providing a thorough analysis of the
computational complexity of this objective, we propose a new efficient election
rule that simultaneously achieves a) a constant-factor approximation guarantee
for it, and b) the property of proportional justified representation (PJR) -
one of the strongest forms of proportional representation. However, the most
striking feature of the new rule is that one can verify in linear time that the
winning committee satisfies the two aforementioned guarantees, even when the
algorithm is executed by an untrusted party who only communicates the output.
As a result, the rule can be adapted into a verifiable computing scheme.
Moreover, its verification procedure easily admits parallel processing for
further efficiency.
  Our work is motivated by an application on blockchain networks that implement
Nominated Proof-of-Stake, where the community elects a committee of validators
to participate in the consensus protocol, and where preventing
overrepresentation protects the network against attacks by an adversarial
minority. Our election rule enables a validator selection protocol with formal
guarantees on security and proportionality, and its adaptation as a verifiable
computing scheme with a parallelized verification proves to be key for its
successful implementation given the computationally limited nature of the

1169,An Automata-Theoretic Approach to the Verification of Distributed Algorithms,"We introduce an automata-theoretic method for the verification of distributed
algorithms running on ring networks. In a distributed algorithm, an arbitrary
number of processes cooperate to achieve a common goal (e.g., elect a leader).
Processes have unique identifiers (pids) from an infinite, totally ordered
domain. An algorithm proceeds in synchronous rounds, each round allowing a
process to perform a bounded sequence of actions such as send or receive a pid,
store it in some register, and compare register contents wrt. the associated
total order. An algorithm is supposed to be correct independently of the number
of processes. To specify correctness properties, we introduce a logic that can
reason about processes and pids. Referring to leader election, it may say that,
at the end of an execution, each process stores the maximum pid in some
dedicated register. Since the verification of distributed algorithms is
undecidable, we propose an underapproximation technique, which bounds the
number of rounds. This is an appealing approach, as the number of rounds needed
by a distributed algorithm to conclude is often exponentially smaller than the
number of processes. We provide an automata-theoretic solution, reducing model
checking to emptiness for alternating two-way automata on words. Overall, we
show that round-bounded verification of distributed algorithms over rings is
PSPACE-complete.",1504.06534v1,cs.LO,2015-04-24 15:03:08+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('C. Aiswarya'), arxiv.Result.Author('Benedikt Bollig'), arxiv.Result.Author('Paul Gastin')]",
1170,A Novel Hybrid Biometric Electronic Voting System: Integrating Finger Print and Face Recognition,"A novel hybrid design based electronic voting system is proposed, implemented
and analyzed. The proposed system uses two voter verification techniques to
give better results in comparison to single identification based systems.
Finger print and facial recognition based methods are used for voter
identification. Cross verification of a voter during an election process
provides better accuracy than single parameter identification method. The
facial recognition system uses Viola-Jones algorithm along with rectangular
Haar feature selection method for detection and extraction of features to
develop a biometric template and for feature extraction during the voting
process. Cascaded machine learning based classifiers are used for comparing the
features for identity verification using GPCA (Generalized Principle Component
Analysis) and K-NN (K-Nearest Neighbor). It is accomplished through comparing
the Eigen-vectors of the extracted features with the biometric template
pre-stored in the election regulatory body database. The results of the
proposed system show that the proposed cascaded design based system performs
better than the systems using other classifiers or separate schemes i.e. facial
or finger print based schemes. The proposed system will be highly useful for
real time applications due to the reason that it has 91% accuracy under nominal
light in terms of facial recognition. with bags of paper votes. The central
station compiles and publishes the names of winners and losers through

justifiably high confidence that the reported results of an election are
consistent with an audit trail (""ballots""), which can be paper or electronic.
SOBA combines three ideas: (1) publishing cast vote records (CVRs) separately
for each contest, so that anyone can verify that each reported contest outcome
is correct, if the CVRs reflect voters' intentions with sufficient accuracy;
(2) shrouding a mapping between ballots and the CVRs for those ballots to
prevent the loss of privacy that could occur otherwise; (3) assessing the
accuracy with which the CVRs reflect voters' intentions for a collection of
contests while simultaneously assessing the integrity of the shrouded mapping
between ballots and CVRs by comparing randomly selected ballots to the CVRs
that purport to represent them. Step (1) is related to work by the Humboldt
County Election Transparency Project, but publishing CVRs separately for
individual contests rather than images of entire ballots preserves privacy.
Step (2) requires a cryptographic commitment from elections officials.
Observers participate in step (3), which relies on the ""super-simple
simultaneous single-ballot risk-limiting audit."" Step (3) is designed to reveal
relatively few ballots if the shrouded mapping is proper and the CVRs
accurately reflect voter intent. But if the reported outcomes of the contests
differ from the outcomes that a full hand count would show, step (3) is
guaranteed to have a large chance of requiring all the ballots to be counted by

only four nodes will have more than a billion states. Although it seems that
model checking is not a feasible approach for this problem, I attempt to use
several effective limiting assumptions for hiring formal model checking
approach without losing the correct functionality of the Peterson's algorithm.
These enforced limiting assumptions target the degree of freedom in the model
checking process and significantly decrease the CPU time, memory usage and the

1175,A Peered Bulletin Board for Robust Use in Verifiable Voting Systems,"The Web Bulletin Board (WBB) is a key component of verifiable election
systems. It is used in the context of election verification to publish evidence
of voting and tallying that voters and officials can check, and where
challenges can be launched in the event of malfeasance. In practice, the
election authority has responsibility for implementing the web bulletin board
correctly and reliably, and will wish to ensure that it behaves correctly even
in the presence of failures and attacks. To ensure robustness, an
implementation will typically use a number of peers to be able to provide a
correct service even when some peers go down or behave dishonestly. In this
paper we propose a new protocol to implement such a Web Bulletin Board,
motivated by the needs of the vVote verifiable voting system. Using a
distributed algorithm increases the complexity of the protocol and requires
careful reasoning in order to establish correctness. Here we use the Event-B
modelling and refinement approach to establish correctness of the peered design
against an idealised specification of the bulletin board behaviour. In
particular we show that for n peers, a threshold of t > 2n/3 peers behaving
correctly is sufficient to ensure correct behaviour of the bulletin board
distributed design. The algorithm also behaves correctly even if honest or
dishonest peers temporarily drop out of the protocol and then return. The
verification approach also establishes that the protocols used within the
bulletin board do not interfere with each other. This is the first time a
peered web bulletin board suite of protocols has been formally verified.",1401.4151v1,cs.CR,2014-01-16 20:11:42+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Chris Culnane'), arxiv.Result.Author('Steve Schneider')]",

framework based on FOL for specifying distributed multi-process protocols in a
process-local manner together with an implicit network topology. In the
specification framework, we provide an auto-active analysis technique to reason
about the protocols locally, in a process-modular way. Our goal is to mirror
the way designers often describe and reason about protocols. By hiding the
topology behind the FOL structure, we simplify the modelling, but complicate
the reasoning. To deal with that, we use an oracle for the topology to develop
a sound and relatively complete proof rule that reduces reasoning about the
implicit topology back to pure FOL. This completely avoids the need to
axiomatize the topology. Using the rule, we establish a property that reduces
verification to a fixed number of processes bounded by the size of local
neighbourhoods. We show how to use the framework on two examples, including

1183,Identifying Possible Winners in Ranked Choice Voting Elections with Outstanding Ballots,"Several election districts in the US have recently moved to ranked-choice
voting (RCV) to decide the results of local elections. RCV allows voters to
rank their choices, and the results are computed in rounds, eliminating one
candidate at a time. RCV ensures fairer elections and has been shown to
increase elected representation of women and people of color. A main drawback
of RCV is that the round-by-round process requires all the ballots to be
tallied before the results of an election can be calculated. With increasingly
large portions of ballots coming from absentee voters, RCV election outcomes
are not always apparent on election night, and can take several weeks to be
published, leading to a loss of trust in the electoral process from the public.
In this paper, we present an algorithm for efficiently computing possible
winners of RCV elections from partially known ballots and evaluate it on data
from the recent New York City Primary elections. We show that our techniques
allow to significantly narrow down the field of possible election winners, and
in some case identify the winner as soon as election night despite a number of
yet-unaccounted absentee ballots, providing more transparency in the electoral
process.",2206.12741v1,cs.CY,2022-06-25 22:08:15+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Alborz Jelvani'), arxiv.Result.Author('Amélie Marian')]",

1188,The Price of Political Uncertainty: Evidence from the 2016 U.S. Presidential Election and the U.S. Stock Markets,"There is bountiful evidence that political uncertainty stemming from
presidential elections or doubt about the direction of future policy make
financial markets significantly volatile, especially in proximity to close
elections or elections that may prompt radical policy changes. Although several
studies have examined the association between presidential elections and stock
returns, very little attention has been given to the impacts of elections and
election induced uncertainty on stock markets. This paper explores, at sectoral
level, the uncertain information hypothesis (UIH) as a means of explaining the
reaction of markets to the arrival of unanticipated information. This
hypothesis postulates that political uncertainty is greater prior to the
elections (relative to pre-election period) but is resolved once the outcome of
the elections is determined (relative to post-election period). To this end, we
adopt an event-study methodology that examines abnormal return behavior around
the election date. We show that collapsing stock returns around the election
result is reversed by positive abnormal return on the next day, except some
cases where we note negative responses following the vote count. Although
Trump's win plunges US into uncertain future, positive reactions of abnormal
return are found. Therefore, our results do not support the UIH hypothesis.
Besides, the effect of political uncertainty is sector-specific. While some
sectors emerged winners (healthcare, oil and gas, real estate, defense,
financials and consumer goods and services), others took the opposite route
(technology and utilities). The winning industries are generally those that
will benefit from the new administration's focus on rebuilding infrastructure,
renegotiating trade agreements, reforming tax policy and labour laws,
increasing defense funding, easing restrictions on energy production, and
rolling back Obamacare.",1612.06200v2,q-fin.GN,2016-12-19 14:28:59+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Jamal Bouoiyour'), arxiv.Result.Author('Refk Selmi')]",

1194,Sublinear Bounds for Randomized Leader Election,"This paper concerns {\em randomized} leader election in synchronous
distributed networks. A distributed leader election algorithm is presented for
complete $n$-node networks that runs in O(1) rounds and (with high probability)
uses only $O(\sqrt{n}\log^{3/2} n)$ messages to elect a unique leader (with
high probability). When considering the ""explicit"" variant of leader election
where eventually every node knows the identity of the leader, our algorithm
yields the asymptotically optimal bounds of O(1) rounds and O(n) messages. This
algorithm is then extended to one solving leader election on any connected
non-bipartite $n$-node graph $G$ in $O(\tau(G))$ time and
$O(\tau(G)\sqrt{n}\log^{3/2} n)$ messages, where $\tau(G)$ is the mixing time
of a random walk on $G$. The above result implies highly efficient (sublinear
running time and messages) leader election algorithms for networks with small
mixing times, such as expanders and hypercubes. In contrast, previous leader
election algorithms had at least linear message complexity even in complete
graphs. Moreover, super-linear message lower bounds are known for
time-efficient {\em deterministic} leader election algorithms.
  Finally, we present an almost matching lower bound for randomized leader
election, showing that $\Omega(\sqrt n)$ messages are needed for any leader
election algorithm that succeeds with probability at least $1/e + \eps$, for
any small constant $\eps > 0$.
  We view our results as a step towards understanding the randomized complexity

number of vote manipulations (changes, additions, and deletions) required to
bring about a change in the set of elected candidates. Knowledge of the MOV of

spent on the auditing of the election, and whether uncovered mistakes (such as
ballot box losses) throw the election result into doubt---requiring a costly
repeat election---or can be safely ignored. In this paper, we present

number of candidates such as Borda. In contrast, we take the first step in
generalizing the results of computational complexity of election misuse to
cases of infinitely many scoring protocols on an unbounded number of
candidates. Interesting families of systems include $k$-approval and $k$-veto
elections, in which voters distinguish $k$ candidates from the candidate set.
  Our main result is to partition the problems of these families based on their
complexity. We do so by showing they are polynomial-time computable, NP-hard,
or polynomial-time equivalent to another problem of interest. We also
demonstrate a surprising connection between manipulation in election systems

1214,High-Multiplicity Election Problems,"The computational study of elections generally assumes that the preferences
of the electorate come in as a list of votes. Depending on the context, it may
be much more natural to represent the list succinctly, as the distinct votes of
the electorate and their counts, i.e., high-multiplicity representation. We
consider how this representation affects the complexity of election problems.
High-multiplicity representation may be exponentially smaller than standard
representation, and so many polynomial-time algorithms for election problems in
standard representation become exponential-time. Surprisingly, for
polynomial-time election problems, we are often able to either adapt the same
approach or provide new algorithms to show that these problems remain
polynomial-time in the high-multiplicity case; this is in sharp contrast to the
case where each voter has a weight, where the complexity usually increases. In
the process we explore the relationship between high-multiplicity scheduling
and manipulation of high-multiplicity elections. And we show that for any fixed
set of job lengths, high-multiplicity scheduling on uniform parallel machines
is in P, which was previously known for only two job lengths. We did not find
any natural case where a polynomial-time election problem does not remain in P
when moving to high-multiplicity representation. However, we found one natural
NP-hard election problem where the complexity does increase, namely winner
determination for Kemeny elections.",1611.08927v5,cs.GT,2016-11-27 22:39:53+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Zack Fitzsimmons'), arxiv.Result.Author('Edith Hemaspaandra')]",

researchers and regulators to miss important sources of error in these complex

satisfaction of voters comes from the final decisions made by the elected

committee to make these final decisions, different multi-winner election rules

1220,Electoral Stability and Rigidity,"Some argue that political stability is best served through a two-party
system. This study refutes this. The author mathematically defines the
stability and rigidity of electoral systems comprised of any quantity of
electors and parties. In fact, stability is a function of the quantity of
electors - i.e., the number of occupied seats at the table. As the number of
electors increases, the properties of an electorate are increasingly well
resolved, and well described by those of an electorate that is least excessive
-- that is to say an electorate that is closest to equilibrium. Further,
electoral rigidity is a function of the quantity of parties and their
probabilities of representation. An absolutely rigid system admits no
fluctuations -- whatever happens to one elector will happen to all electors. As
the quantity of parties increases so does the number of party lines, and with
it the quantity of alternatives with which to respond to an external stimulus.
Rigidity is significant in a social system that places high value on party
loyalty. In conclusion, (i) electoral stability is best served by increasing
the quantity of electors; (ii) electoral rigidity is best served by decreasing
the quantity of parties, and by increasing the representation of some parties
at the expense of others; and (iii) the less stable a branch of government, the
more concern is placed on those who would hold those offices for the people.",1608.05038v1,q-fin.EC,2016-08-16 05:17:34+00:00,[arxiv.Result.Author('Michael Y. Levy')],

77.769 votes were ""contaminated"" as there have been -- at least on a formal
level - violations of the legal procedure when counting those votes. For
example, the envelopes were opened prematurely, or not all the members of the
electoral board were present during the counting etc. Hence the court
considered the scenario that the irregular counting of these votes might have
caused a reversal of the result as possible. The constitutional court sentenced
that this possibility presents a sufficient irregularity in order to order a
repetition of the entire election. While it is, of course, possible that the
irregular counting of those 77.769 votes reversed the result, we shall show

functions}, i.e. the attitude of each party to form or not an alliance. In the
first model the interactions between each party and their electors are
considered. We show that these interactions drive the decision functions
towards certain asymptotic values depending on the electors only: this is the
{\em perfect party}, which behaves following the electors' suggestions. The
second model is an extension of the first one in which we include a $rule$
which modifies the status of the electors, and of the decision functions as a
consequence, at some specific time step. In the third model we neglect the
interactions with the electors while we consider cubic and quartic interactions
between the parties and we show that we get (slightly oscillating) asymptotic
values for the decision functions, close to their initial values. This is the
{\em real party}, which does not listen to the electors. Several explicit
situations are considered in details and numerical results are also shown.",1704.05453v1,physics.soc-ph,2017-04-18 14:27:47+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('F. Bagarello'), arxiv.Result.Author('F. Gargano')]",

variation of electoral violence across time and space in Kenya during
1992-2013. We find that infants and adolescents exposed to electoral violence

of the victims of electoral violence, particularly boys, also have reduced
height-for-age. Higher food prices and changes in diet experienced during
outbreaks of violence are important mechanisms. No impact is found on the

1224,Electoral Susceptibility,"In the United States electoral system, a candidate is elected indirectly by
winning a majority of electoral votes cast by individual states, the election
usually being decided by the votes cast by a small number of ""swing states""
where the two candidates historically have roughly equal probabilities of
winning. The effective value of a swing state in deciding the election is
determined not only by the number of its electoral votes but by the frequency
of its appearance in the set of winning partitions of the electoral college.
Since the electoral vote values of swing states are not identical, the presence
or absence of a state in a winning partition is generally correlated with the
frequency of appearance of other states and, hence, their effective values. We
quantify the effective value of states by an {\sl electoral susceptibility},
$\chi_j$, the variation of the winning probability with the ""cost"" of changing
the probability of winning state $j$. We study $\chi_j$ for realistic data
accumulated for the 2012 U.S. presidential election and for a simple model with
a Zipf's law type distribution of electoral votes. In the latter model we show
that the susceptibility for small states is largest in ""one-sided"" electoral
contests and smallest in close contests. We draw an analogy to models of

1238,A mixture of experts model for rank data with applications in election studies,"A voting bloc is defined to be a group of voters who have similar voting
preferences. The cleavage of the Irish electorate into voting blocs is of
interest. Irish elections employ a ``single transferable vote'' electoral
system; under this system voters rank some or all of the electoral candidates
in order of preference. These rank votes provide a rich source of preference
information from which inferences about the composition of the electorate may
be drawn. Additionally, the influence of social factors or covariates on the
electorate composition is of interest. A mixture of experts model is a mixture
model in which the model parameters are functions of covariates. A mixture of
experts model for rank data is developed to provide a model-based method to
cluster Irish voters into voting blocs, to examine the influence of social
factors on this clustering and to examine the characteristic preferences of the
voting blocs. The Benter model for rank data is employed as the family of
component densities within the mixture of experts model; generalized linear
model theory is employed to model the influence of covariates on the mixing
proportions. Model fitting is achieved via a hybrid of the EM and MM
algorithms. An example of the methodology is illustrated by examining an Irish
presidential election. The existence of voting blocs in the electorate is
established and it is determined that age and government satisfaction levels
are important factors in influencing voting in this election.",0901.4203v1,stat.AP,2009-01-27 09:16:05+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Isobel Claire Gormley'), arxiv.Result.Author('Thomas Brendan Murphy')]","Annals of Applied Statistics 2008, Vol. 2, No. 4, 1452-1477"
1239,The adoption and challenges of electronic voting technologies within the South African context,"Literature has shown that countries such as Brazil and India have
successfully implemented electronic voting systems and other countries are at
various piloting stages to address many challenges associated with manual paper
based system such ascosts of physical ballot paper and other overheads,
electoral delays, distribution of electoral materials, and general lack of
confidence in the electoral process. It is in this context that this study
explores how South African can leverage the opportunities that e-voting
presents. Manual voting is often tedious, non-secure, and time-consuming, which
leads us to think about using electronic facilities to make the process more
efficient. This study proposes that the adoption of electronic voting
technologies could perhaps mitigate some of these issues and challengesin the
process improving the electoral process. The study used an on-line
questionnaire which was administered to a broader group of voters and an
in-depth semi-structured interview with the Independent Electoral Commission
officials. The analysis is based on thematic analysis and diffusion of
innovations theory is adopted as a theoretical lens of analysis. The findings
reveal that relative advantage, compatibility and complexity would determine
the intentions of South African voters and the Electoral Management Bodies
(IEC) to adopt e-voting technologies. Moreover, the findings also reveal
several other factorsthat could influence the adoption process. The study is
limited to only voters in Cape Town and these voters were expected to have some
access to the internet. The sample size limits the generalizability of the

system. This study refutes this. The author mathematically defines the
stability and rigidity of electoral systems comprised of any quantity of
electors and parties. In fact, stability is a function of the quantity of
electors - i.e., the number of occupied seats at the table. As the number of
electors increases, the properties of an electorate are increasingly well
resolved, and well described by those of an electorate that is least excessive
-- that is to say an electorate that is closest to equilibrium. Further,
electoral rigidity is a function of the quantity of parties and their
probabilities of representation. An absolutely rigid system admits no
fluctuations -- whatever happens to one elector will happen to all electors. As
the quantity of parties increases so does the number of party lines, and with
it the quantity of alternatives with which to respond to an external stimulus.
Rigidity is significant in a social system that places high value on party
loyalty. In conclusion, (i) electoral stability is best served by increasing
the quantity of electors; (ii) electoral rigidity is best served by decreasing
the quantity of parties, and by increasing the representation of some parties
at the expense of others; and (iii) the less stable a branch of government, the
more concern is placed on those who would hold those offices for the people.",1608.05038v1,q-fin.EC,2016-08-16 05:17:34+00:00,[arxiv.Result.Author('Michael Y. Levy')],

description of alliances between political parties interacting among themselves

different models, deducing the dynamics of their related {\em decision
functions}, i.e. the attitude of each party to form or not an alliance. In the
first model the interactions between each party and their electors are
considered. We show that these interactions drive the decision functions
towards certain asymptotic values depending on the electors only: this is the
{\em perfect party}, which behaves following the electors' suggestions. The
second model is an extension of the first one in which we include a $rule$
which modifies the status of the electors, and of the decision functions as a
consequence, at some specific time step. In the third model we neglect the
interactions with the electors while we consider cubic and quartic interactions
between the parties and we show that we get (slightly oscillating) asymptotic
values for the decision functions, close to their initial values. This is the
{\em real party}, which does not listen to the electors. Several explicit
situations are considered in details and numerical results are also shown.",1704.05453v1,physics.soc-ph,2017-04-18 14:27:47+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('F. Bagarello'), arxiv.Result.Author('F. Gargano')]",

medium- and long-term effects of electoral violence on young children and

recursive nature has a detrimental effect on the height of children and
adolescents of affected households. Our identification strategy uses the
variation of electoral violence across time and space in Kenya during
1992-2013. We find that infants and adolescents exposed to electoral violence
are shorter as adults if compared to similar people not exposed to violence
during their growing age. We also find inter-generation effects as the children
of the victims of electoral violence, particularly boys, also have reduced
height-for-age. Higher food prices and changes in diet experienced during
outbreaks of violence are important mechanisms. No impact is found on the
educational attainment of school-aged pupils as electoral violence has been
concentrated during the school holidays.",2112.13849v1,econ.GN,2021-12-27 12:23:04+00:00,[arxiv.Result.Author('Roxana Gutiérrez-Romero')],
1245,Electoral Susceptibility,"In the United States electoral system, a candidate is elected indirectly by
winning a majority of electoral votes cast by individual states, the election
usually being decided by the votes cast by a small number of ""swing states""
where the two candidates historically have roughly equal probabilities of
winning. The effective value of a swing state in deciding the election is
determined not only by the number of its electoral votes but by the frequency
of its appearance in the set of winning partitions of the electoral college.
Since the electoral vote values of swing states are not identical, the presence
or absence of a state in a winning partition is generally correlated with the
frequency of appearance of other states and, hence, their effective values. We
quantify the effective value of states by an {\sl electoral susceptibility},
$\chi_j$, the variation of the winning probability with the ""cost"" of changing
the probability of winning state $j$. We study $\chi_j$ for realistic data
accumulated for the 2012 U.S. presidential election and for a simple model with
a Zipf's law type distribution of electoral votes. In the latter model we show

compensation for all votes that are not necessary to win the district (negative

  The model is studied in the case of two parties. When the number of votes for
the majority party follows a uniform distribution in each district, DVT results
in the greatest expected seat share, however, application of PVT, and,
especially, NVT increases the probability of winning the election. The
trade-off between vote transfer formulas and the number of list mandates
reveals that the majority party should use an appropriately calibrated NVT
system if it focuses on these two variables.",1607.02879v3,cs.GT,2016-07-11 09:58:58+00:00,[arxiv.Result.Author('László Csató')],

summarization. In this paper, we propose a new task: identifying the purpose
behind electoral tweets--why do people post election-oriented tweets? We show
that identifying purpose is correlated with the related phenomenon of sentiment
and emotion detection, but yet significantly different. Detecting purpose has a
number of applications including detecting the mood of the electorate,
estimating the popularity of policies, identifying key issues of contention,
and predicting the course of events. We create a large dataset of electoral
tweets and annotate a few thousand tweets for purpose. We develop a system that
automatically classifies electoral tweets as per their purpose, obtaining an
accuracy of 43.56% on an 11-class task and an accuracy of 73.91% on a 3-class
task (both accuracies well above the most-frequent-class baseline). Finally, we
show that resources developed for emotion detection are also helpful for
detecting purpose.",1311.1194v1,cs.CL,2013-11-05 20:55:23+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Saif M. Mohammad'), arxiv.Result.Author('Svetlana Kiritchenko'), arxiv.Result.Author('Joel Martin')]","In Proceedings of the KDD Workshop on Issues of Sentiment

1265,A mixture of experts model for rank data with applications in election studies,"A voting bloc is defined to be a group of voters who have similar voting
preferences. The cleavage of the Irish electorate into voting blocs is of
interest. Irish elections employ a ``single transferable vote'' electoral
system; under this system voters rank some or all of the electoral candidates
in order of preference. These rank votes provide a rich source of preference
information from which inferences about the composition of the electorate may
be drawn. Additionally, the influence of social factors or covariates on the
electorate composition is of interest. A mixture of experts model is a mixture
model in which the model parameters are functions of covariates. A mixture of
experts model for rank data is developed to provide a model-based method to
cluster Irish voters into voting blocs, to examine the influence of social
factors on this clustering and to examine the characteristic preferences of the
voting blocs. The Benter model for rank data is employed as the family of
component densities within the mixture of experts model; generalized linear
model theory is employed to model the influence of covariates on the mixing
proportions. Model fitting is achieved via a hybrid of the EM and MM
algorithms. An example of the methodology is illustrated by examining an Irish
presidential election. The existence of voting blocs in the electorate is
established and it is determined that age and government satisfaction levels

1266,The adoption and challenges of electronic voting technologies within the South African context,"Literature has shown that countries such as Brazil and India have
successfully implemented electronic voting systems and other countries are at
various piloting stages to address many challenges associated with manual paper
based system such ascosts of physical ballot paper and other overheads,
electoral delays, distribution of electoral materials, and general lack of
confidence in the electoral process. It is in this context that this study
explores how South African can leverage the opportunities that e-voting
presents. Manual voting is often tedious, non-secure, and time-consuming, which
leads us to think about using electronic facilities to make the process more
efficient. This study proposes that the adoption of electronic voting
technologies could perhaps mitigate some of these issues and challengesin the
process improving the electoral process. The study used an on-line
questionnaire which was administered to a broader group of voters and an
in-depth semi-structured interview with the Independent Electoral Commission
officials. The analysis is based on thematic analysis and diffusion of
innovations theory is adopted as a theoretical lens of analysis. The findings
reveal that relative advantage, compatibility and complexity would determine
the intentions of South African voters and the Electoral Management Bodies
(IEC) to adopt e-voting technologies. Moreover, the findings also reveal
several other factorsthat could influence the adoption process. The study is
limited to only voters in Cape Town and these voters were expected to have some
access to the internet. The sample size limits the generalizability of the
findings of this study.",1312.2406v1,cs.CY,2013-12-09 12:24:20+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Mourine Achieng'), arxiv.Result.Author('Ephias Ruhode')]",
1267,Exploring Fairness in District-based Multi-party Elections under different Voting Rules using Stochastic Simulations,"Many democratic societies use district-based elections, where the region
under consideration is geographically divided into districts and a
representative is chosen for each district based on the preferences of the
electors who reside there. These representatives belong to political parties,
and the executive powers are acquired by that party which has a majority of the
elected district representatives. In most systems, each elector can express
preference for one candidate, though they may have a complete or partial
ranking of the candidates/parties. We show that this can lead to situations
where many electors are dissatisfied with the election results, which is not
desirable in a democracy. The results may be biased towards the supporters of a
particular party, and against others. Inspired by current literature on
fairness of Machine Learning algorithms, we define measures of fairness to
quantify the satisfaction of electors, irrespective of their political choices.
We also consider alternative election policies using concepts of voting rules
and rank aggregation, to enable voters to express their detailed preferences
without making the electoral process cumbersome or opaque. We then evaluate
these policies using the aforementioned fairness measures with the help of
Monte Carlo simulations. Such simulations are obtained using a proposed
stochastic model for election simulation, that takes into account community
identities of electors and its role in influencing their residence and
political preferences. We show that this model can simulate actual multi-party
elections in India. Through extensive simulations, we find that allowing voters
to provide 2 preferences reduces the disparity between supporters of different
parties in terms of the election result.",2203.03720v1,cs.CY,2022-02-25 18:03:03+00:00,[arxiv.Result.Author('Adway Mitra')],

it go beyond the 70% of processed certificates; hence it have an improvement at

shown that many of the NP-hardness shields, previously obtained, vanish when
the electorate has single-peaked or nearly single-peaked preferences. In light
of these results, we investigate whether it is possible to reimpose NP-hardness
shields for such electorates by allowing the voters to specify partial
preferences instead of insisting they cast complete ballots. In particular, we
show that in single-peaked and nearly single-peaked electorates, if voters are

1273,Between order and disorder: a 'weak law' on recent electoral behavior among urban voters?,"A new viewpoint on electoral involvement is proposed from the study of the
statistics of the proportions of abstentionists, blank and null, and votes
according to list of choices, in a large number of national elections in
different countries. Considering 11 countries without compulsory voting
(Austria, Canada, Czech Republic, France, Germany, Italy, Mexico, Poland,
Romania, Spain and Switzerland), a stylized fact emerges for the most populated
cities when one computes the entropy associated to the three ratios, which we
call the entropy of civic involvement of the electorate. The distribution of
this entropy (over all elections and countries) appears to be sharply peaked
near a common value. This almost common value is typically shared since the
1970's by electorates of the most populated municipalities, and this despite
the wide disparities between voting systems and types of elections. Performing
different statistical analyses, we notably show that this stylized fact reveals
particular correlations between the blank/null votes and abstentionists ratios.
  We suggest that the existence of this hidden regularity, which we propose to
coin as a `weak law on recent electoral behavior among urban voters', reveals
an emerging collective behavioral norm characteristic of urban citizen voting
behavior in modern democracies. Analyzing exceptions to the rule provide
insights into the conditions under which this normative behavior can be

ballot marking devices (BMDs) is presently the subject of some controversy.
Recent studies (e.g., Bernhard, et al. 2020) suggest the verification rate is
low. What is not clear from previous research is whether this is more a result
of voters being unable to do so accurately or whether this is because voters
simply choose not to attempt verification in the first place. In order to
understand this problem, we conducted an experiment in which 108 participants
participated in a mock election where the BMD displayed the voters' true
choices, but then changed a subset of those choices on the printed ballot. The
design of the printed ballot, the length of the ballot, the number of changes
that were made to the ballot, the location of those changes, and the
instructions provided to the voters were manipulated as part of the experiment.
Results indicated that of those voters who chose to examine the printed ballot,
76% detected anomalies, indicating that voters can reliably detect errors on
their ballot if they will simply review it. This suggests that administrative
remedies, rather than attempts to alter fundamental human perceptual
capabilities, could be employed to encourage voters to check their ballots,

1303,"More style, less work: card-style data decrease risk-limiting audit sample sizes","U.S. elections rely heavily on computers such as voter registration
databases, electronic pollbooks, voting machines, scanners, tabulators, and
results reporting websites. These introduce digital threats to election
outcomes. Risk-limiting audits (RLAs) mitigate threats to some of these systems
by manually inspecting random samples of ballot cards. RLAs have a large chance
of correcting wrong outcomes (by conducting a full manual tabulation of a
trustworthy record of the votes), but can save labor when reported outcomes are
correct. This efficiency is eroded when sampling cannot be targeted to ballot
cards that contain the contest(s) under audit. If the sample is drawn from all
cast cards, RLA sample sizes scale like the reciprocal of the fraction of
ballot cards that contain the contest(s) under audit. That fraction shrinks as
the number of cards per ballot grows (i.e., when elections contain more
contests) and as the fraction of ballots that contain the contest decreases
(i.e., when a smaller percentage of voters are eligible to vote in the
contest). States that conduct RLAs of contests on multi-card ballots or of
small contests can dramatically reduce sample sizes by using information about
which ballot cards contain which contests -- by keeping track of card-style
data (CSD). For instance, CSD reduces the expected number of draws needed to
audit a single countywide contest on a 4-card ballot by 75%. Similarly, CSD
reduces the expected number of draws by 95% or more for an audit of two
contests with the same margin on a 4-card ballot if one contest is on every
ballot and the other is on 10% of ballots. In realistic examples, the savings
can be several orders of magnitude.",2012.03371v1,cs.CR,2020-12-06 20:35:12+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Amanda K. Glazer'), arxiv.Result.Author('Jacob V. Spertus'), arxiv.Result.Author('Philip B. Stark')]",

to secure the voting process: namely, to certify that the computed results are
consistent with the cast ballots, and that the privacy of the voters is
preserved. We propose herein a secure voting protocol for elections that are
governed by order-based voting rules. Our protocol offers perfect ballot
secrecy, in the sense that it issues only the required output, while no other
information on the cast ballots is revealed. Such perfect secrecy, which is
achieved by employing secure multiparty computation tools, may increase the
voters' confidence and, consequently, encourage them to vote according to their
true preferences. Evaluation of the protocol's computational costs establishes
that it is lightweight and can be readily implemented in real-life electronic

the future information society. It will have an enormous impact on the election
process making it fast, reliable and inexpensive. Nonetheless, so far remote

susceptibility of the voter's PC to various cyber-attacks. As a result, most
the research effort is put into developing protocols and machines for poll-site
electronic voting. Although these solutions yield promising results, they
cannot be directly adopted to Internet voting because of secure platform
problem. However, the cryptographic components they utilize may be very useful.
This paper presents a scheme based on combination of mixnets and homomorphic
encryption borrowed from robust poll-site voting, along with techniques
recommended for remote voting -- code sheets and test ballots. The protocol
tries to minimize the trust put in voter's PC by making the voter responsible
for manual encryption of his vote. To achieve this, the voter obtains a paper
ballot that allows him to scramble the vote by performing simple operations
(lookup in a table). Creation of paper ballots, as well as decryption of votes,
is performed by a group of cooperating trusted servers. As a result, the scheme
is characterized by strong asymmetry -- all computations are carried out on the
server side. In consequence it does not require any additional hardware on the
voter's side, and offers distributed trust, receipt-freeness and verifiability.",0804.2349v1,cs.CR,2008-04-15 10:26:40+00:00,[arxiv.Result.Author('Lukasz Nitschke')],
1309,A Unified Evaluation of Two-Candidate Ballot-Polling Election Auditing Methods,"Counting votes is complex and error-prone. Several statistical methods have

selected physical ballots. Two 'principled' methods are risk-limiting audits
(RLAs) and Bayesian audits (BAs). RLAs use frequentist statistical inference
while BAs are based on Bayesian inference. Until recently, the two have been
thought of as fundamentally different.
  We present results that unify and shed light upon 'ballot-polling' RLAs and
BAs (which only require the ability to sample uniformly at random from all cast
ballot cards) for two-candidate plurality contests, which are building blocks
for auditing more complex social choice functions, including some preferential
voting systems. We highlight the connections between the methods and explore
their performance.
  First, building on a previous demonstration of the mathematical equivalence
of classical and Bayesian approaches, we show that BAs, suitably calibrated,
are risk-limiting. Second, we compare the efficiency of the methods across a
wide range of contest sizes and margins, focusing on the distribution of sample
sizes required to attain a given risk limit. Third, we outline several ways to
improve performance and show how the mathematical equivalence explains the
improvements.",2008.08536v2,stat.AP,2020-08-19 16:30:03+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Zhuoqun Huang'), arxiv.Result.Author('Ronald L. Rivest'), arxiv.Result.Author('Philip B.

1310,Limiting Risk by Turning Manifest Phantoms into Evil Zombies,"Drawing a random sample of ballots to conduct a risk-limiting audit generally
requires knowing how the ballots cast in an election are organized into groups,
for instance, how many containers of ballots there are in all and how many
ballots are in each container. A list of the ballot group identifiers along
with number of ballots in each group is called a ballot manifest. What if the
ballot manifest is not accurate? Surprisingly, even if ballots are known to be
missing from the manifest, it is not necessary to make worst-case assumptions
about those ballots--for instance, to adjust the margin by the number of
missing ballots--to ensure that the audit remains conservative. Rather, it
suffices to make worst-case assumptions about the individual randomly selected
ballots that the audit cannot find. This observation provides a simple
modification to some risk-limiting audit procedures that makes them
automatically become more conservative if the ballot manifest has errors. The
modification--phantoms to evil zombies (~2EZ)--requires only an upper bound on
the total number of ballots cast. ~2EZ makes the audit P-value stochastically
larger than it would be had the manifest been accurate, automatically requiring
more than enough ballots to be audited to offset the manifest errors. This
ensures that the true risk limit remains smaller than the nominal risk limit.
On the other hand, if the manifest is in fact accurate and the upper bound on
the total number of ballots equals the total according to the manifest, ~2EZ
has no effect at all on the number of ballots audited nor on the true risk
limit.",1207.3413v1,stat.AP,2012-07-14 11:26:02+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Jorge H. Banuelos'), arxiv.Result.Author('Philip B. Stark')]",

selections on a BMD. We then required them to examine their ballots for any
changes from the slate they used to vote. Overall accuracy was exceptionally
high. Participants saw 1440 total contests, and of those 1440, there were a
total of 4 errors, so total accuracy was 99.8%. Participants were able to
perform with near-perfect accuracy regardless of ballot length, ballot type,
number of altered races, and location of altered races. Detection performance
was extremely robust. We conclude that with proper direction and resources,
voters can be near-perfect detectors of ballot changes on printed paper ballots

systematic bias into election results. This is because, even if the errors are
random, votes for different candidates occur in different patterns that are
affected differently by random errors. In the STV context, the most important
effect of random errors is to invalidate the ballot. This removes far more
votes for those candidates whose supporters tend to list a lot of preferences,
because their ballots are much more likely to be invalidated by random error.
Different validity rules for different voting styles mean that errors are much

1322,"More style, less work: card-style data decrease risk-limiting audit sample sizes","U.S. elections rely heavily on computers such as voter registration
databases, electronic pollbooks, voting machines, scanners, tabulators, and
results reporting websites. These introduce digital threats to election
outcomes. Risk-limiting audits (RLAs) mitigate threats to some of these systems
by manually inspecting random samples of ballot cards. RLAs have a large chance
of correcting wrong outcomes (by conducting a full manual tabulation of a
trustworthy record of the votes), but can save labor when reported outcomes are
correct. This efficiency is eroded when sampling cannot be targeted to ballot
cards that contain the contest(s) under audit. If the sample is drawn from all
cast cards, RLA sample sizes scale like the reciprocal of the fraction of
ballot cards that contain the contest(s) under audit. That fraction shrinks as
the number of cards per ballot grows (i.e., when elections contain more
contests) and as the fraction of ballots that contain the contest decreases
(i.e., when a smaller percentage of voters are eligible to vote in the
contest). States that conduct RLAs of contests on multi-card ballots or of
small contests can dramatically reduce sample sizes by using information about
which ballot cards contain which contests -- by keeping track of card-style
data (CSD). For instance, CSD reduces the expected number of draws needed to
audit a single countywide contest on a 4-card ballot by 75%. Similarly, CSD
reduces the expected number of draws by 95% or more for an audit of two
contests with the same margin on a 4-card ballot if one contest is on every
ballot and the other is on 10% of ballots. In realistic examples, the savings
can be several orders of magnitude.",2012.03371v1,cs.CR,2020-12-06 20:35:12+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Amanda K. Glazer'), arxiv.Result.Author('Jacob V. Spertus'), arxiv.Result.Author('Philip B. Stark')]",
1323,SparseAlign: A Super-Resolution Algorithm for Automatic Marker Localization and Deformation Estimation in Cryo-Electron Tomography,"Tilt-series alignment is crucial to obtaining high-resolution reconstructions
in cryo-electron tomography. Beam-induced local deformation of the sample is
hard to estimate from the low-contrast sample alone, and often requires
fiducial gold bead markers. The state-of-the-art approach for deformation
estimation uses (semi-)manually labelled marker locations in projection data to
fit the parameters of a polynomial deformation model. Manually-labelled marker
locations are difficult to obtain when data are noisy or markers overlap in
projection data. We propose an alternative mathematical approach for
simultaneous marker localization and deformation estimation by extending a
grid-free super-resolution algorithm first proposed in the context of
single-molecule localization microscopy. Our approach does not require labelled
marker locations; instead, we use an image-based loss where we compare the
forward projection of markers with the observed data. We equip this marker
localization scheme with an additional deformation estimation component and
solve for a reduced number of deformation parameters. Using extensive numerical
studies on marker-only samples, we show that our approach automatically finds
markers and reliably estimates sample deformation without labelled marker data.
We further demonstrate the applicability of our approach for a broad range of
model mismatch scenarios, including experimental electron tomography data of
gold markers on ice.",2201.08706v1,eess.IV,2022-01-21 14:03:32+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Poulami Somanya Ganguly'), arxiv.Result.Author('Felix Lucka'), arxiv.Result.Author('Holger Kohr'), arxiv.Result.Author('Erik Franken'), arxiv.Result.Author('Hermen Jan Hupkes'), arxiv.Result.Author('K Joost Batenburg')]",

to secure the voting process: namely, to certify that the computed results are

governed by order-based voting rules. Our protocol offers perfect ballot
secrecy, in the sense that it issues only the required output, while no other
information on the cast ballots is revealed. Such perfect secrecy, which is
achieved by employing secure multiparty computation tools, may increase the

1329,Secure Remote Voting Using Paper Ballots,"Internet voting will probably be one of the most significant achievements of
the future information society. It will have an enormous impact on the election
process making it fast, reliable and inexpensive. Nonetheless, so far remote
voting is considered to be very difficult, as one has to take into account
susceptibility of the voter's PC to various cyber-attacks. As a result, most
the research effort is put into developing protocols and machines for poll-site
electronic voting. Although these solutions yield promising results, they
cannot be directly adopted to Internet voting because of secure platform
problem. However, the cryptographic components they utilize may be very useful.
This paper presents a scheme based on combination of mixnets and homomorphic
encryption borrowed from robust poll-site voting, along with techniques
recommended for remote voting -- code sheets and test ballots. The protocol
tries to minimize the trust put in voter's PC by making the voter responsible
for manual encryption of his vote. To achieve this, the voter obtains a paper
ballot that allows him to scramble the vote by performing simple operations
(lookup in a table). Creation of paper ballots, as well as decryption of votes,
is performed by a group of cooperating trusted servers. As a result, the scheme
is characterized by strong asymmetry -- all computations are carried out on the
server side. In consequence it does not require any additional hardware on the
voter's side, and offers distributed trust, receipt-freeness and verifiability.",0804.2349v1,cs.CR,2008-04-15 10:26:40+00:00,[arxiv.Result.Author('Lukasz Nitschke')],

  We present results that unify and shed light upon 'ballot-polling' RLAs and
BAs (which only require the ability to sample uniformly at random from all cast
ballot cards) for two-candidate plurality contests, which are building blocks
for auditing more complex social choice functions, including some preferential
voting systems. We highlight the connections between the methods and explore
their performance.
  First, building on a previous demonstration of the mathematical equivalence
of classical and Bayesian approaches, we show that BAs, suitably calibrated,
are risk-limiting. Second, we compare the efficiency of the methods across a

sex differences in the diagnosis and treatment of Acute Coronary Syndrome

sub-populations has been scarcely studied. The present study aims to explore
machine learning (ML) models to identify in-hospital mortality markers for
women and men in ACS sub-populations collected from a public database of
electronic health records (EHR). Methods: We extracted 1,299 patients with
ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and 2,820 patients with
non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) from the Medical Information
Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC)-III database. We trained and validated
mortality prediction models and used an interpretability technique to identify
sex-specific markers for each sub-population. Results: The models based on
eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) achieved the highest performance: area
under the curve (AUC) = 0.94 (95\% CI:0.84-0.96) for STEMI and AUC = 0.94 (95\%
CI:0.80-0.90) for NSTEMI. For STEMI, the top markers in women are chronic
kidney failure, high heart rate, and age over 70 years. For men, the top
markers are acute kidney failure, high troponin T levels, and age over 75
years. However, for NSTEMI, the top markers in women are low troponin levels,
high urea levels, and age over 80 years. For men, the top markers are high
heart rate, creatinine levels, and age over 70 years. Conclusions: Our results
show possible significant and coherent sex-specific risk markers of different

1332,Limiting Risk by Turning Manifest Phantoms into Evil Zombies,"Drawing a random sample of ballots to conduct a risk-limiting audit generally
requires knowing how the ballots cast in an election are organized into groups,
for instance, how many containers of ballots there are in all and how many
ballots are in each container. A list of the ballot group identifiers along
with number of ballots in each group is called a ballot manifest. What if the
ballot manifest is not accurate? Surprisingly, even if ballots are known to be
missing from the manifest, it is not necessary to make worst-case assumptions
about those ballots--for instance, to adjust the margin by the number of
missing ballots--to ensure that the audit remains conservative. Rather, it
suffices to make worst-case assumptions about the individual randomly selected
ballots that the audit cannot find. This observation provides a simple
modification to some risk-limiting audit procedures that makes them
automatically become more conservative if the ballot manifest has errors. The
modification--phantoms to evil zombies (~2EZ)--requires only an upper bound on
the total number of ballots cast. ~2EZ makes the audit P-value stochastically
larger than it would be had the manifest been accurate, automatically requiring
more than enough ballots to be audited to offset the manifest errors. This
ensures that the true risk limit remains smaller than the nominal risk limit.
On the other hand, if the manifest is in fact accurate and the upper bound on
the total number of ballots equals the total according to the manifest, ~2EZ
has no effect at all on the number of ballots audited nor on the true risk
limit.",1207.3413v1,stat.AP,2012-07-14 11:26:02+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Jorge H. Banuelos'), arxiv.Result.Author('Philip B. Stark')]",

we demonstrate that this Chern marker is equivalent to the lattice charge
polarization susceptibility to a circularly polarized electric field, which can
be defined even at nonzero temperature. A Chern marker spectral function is
also introduced to describe the frequency-dependence of the circular dichroism
measurement. As the system changes from a topologically trivial to a nontrivial
phase, the nonlocal charge polarization susceptibility, equivalent to what we
call the Chern correlator, gradually increases its magnitude. From the
off-diagonal elements of the Chern operator, a nonlocal Chern marker is further
introduced. This quantity corresponds to a previously introduced Wannier state
correlation function, and becomes long-ranged near topological phase
transitions. Our theory thus clarifies the real space measurement of
topological order and topological correlations in these systems, allowing the
experimentally measurable spectral functions at nonzero temperature to be
calculated.",2207.00016v2,cond-mat.str-el,2022-06-30 18:00:01+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Paolo Molignini'), arxiv.Result.Author('Bastien Lapierre'), arxiv.Result.Author('R. Chitra'), arxiv.Result.Author('Wei Chen')]",

superlattices can exhibit different structural symmetries, thus have markedly
different electronic properties which can in turn be used as ""structural
markers"". We illustrate this general principle on the layered LaOBiS2 compound

polytype superlattices reveal both qualitatively and quantitatively distinct
electronic structure markers associated with the Rashba physics, yet the total

identifying subtle structural features via electronic markers. We show that the
pattern of removal of band degeneracies in different polytypes by the different
forms of symmetry breaking leads to new Rashba ""mini gaps"" with characteristic
Rashba parameters that can be determined from spectroscopy, thereby narrowing
down the physically possible polytypes. By identifying these distinct
DFT-predicted fingerprints via ARPES measurements on LaBiOS2 we found the
dominant polytype with small amounts of mixtures of other polytypes. This

(2) shrouding a mapping between ballots and the CVRs for those ballots to

1345,Next Steps for the Colorado Risk-Limiting Audit (CORLA) Program,"Colorado conducted risk-limiting tabulation audits (RLAs) across the state in
2017, including both ballot-level comparison audits and ballot-polling audits.
Those audits only covered contests restricted to a single county; methods to
efficiently audit contests that cross county boundaries and combine ballot
polling and ballot-level comparisons have not been available.
  Colorado's current audit software (RLATool) needs to be improved to audit
these contests that cross county lines and to audit small contests efficiently.
  This paper addresses these needs. It presents extremely simple but
inefficient methods, more efficient methods that combine ballot polling and
ballot-level comparisons using stratified samples, and methods that combine
ballot-level comparison and variable-size batch comparison audits in a way that
does not require stratified sampling.
  We conclude with some recommendations, and illustrate our recommended method
using examples that compare them to existing approaches. Exemplar open-source

identity of the voters cannot be matched with their vote. To achieve this we
use an entangled quantum state to represent the ballots. Each ballot includes

Measuring the content of the envelope yields a random number which reveals no

the scan velocity of the electron beam. In the process window the EBM products
are classified into the categories, porous, good and swelling, depending on the
quality of the surface. The same parameter sets are used to generate a
numerical process window. A comparison of numerical and experimental process
windows shows a good agreement. This validates the EBM model and justifies
simulations for future improvements of EBM processes. In particular numerical
simulations can be used to explain future process window scenarios and find the
best parameter set for a good surface quality and dense products.",1402.2440v1,cs.CE,2014-02-11 10:59:00+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Regina Ammer'), arxiv.Result.Author('Matthias Markl'), arxiv.Result.Author('Vera Jüchter'), arxiv.Result.Author('Carolin Körner'), arxiv.Result.Author('Ulrich Rüde')]",
1348,"More style, less work: card-style data decrease risk-limiting audit sample sizes","U.S. elections rely heavily on computers such as voter registration
databases, electronic pollbooks, voting machines, scanners, tabulators, and
results reporting websites. These introduce digital threats to election
outcomes. Risk-limiting audits (RLAs) mitigate threats to some of these systems
by manually inspecting random samples of ballot cards. RLAs have a large chance
of correcting wrong outcomes (by conducting a full manual tabulation of a
trustworthy record of the votes), but can save labor when reported outcomes are
correct. This efficiency is eroded when sampling cannot be targeted to ballot
cards that contain the contest(s) under audit. If the sample is drawn from all
cast cards, RLA sample sizes scale like the reciprocal of the fraction of
ballot cards that contain the contest(s) under audit. That fraction shrinks as
the number of cards per ballot grows (i.e., when elections contain more
contests) and as the fraction of ballots that contain the contest decreases
(i.e., when a smaller percentage of voters are eligible to vote in the
contest). States that conduct RLAs of contests on multi-card ballots or of
small contests can dramatically reduce sample sizes by using information about
which ballot cards contain which contests -- by keeping track of card-style
data (CSD). For instance, CSD reduces the expected number of draws needed to
audit a single countywide contest on a 4-card ballot by 75%. Similarly, CSD
reduces the expected number of draws by 95% or more for an audit of two
contests with the same margin on a 4-card ballot if one contest is on every
ballot and the other is on 10% of ballots. In realistic examples, the savings
can be several orders of magnitude.",2012.03371v1,cs.CR,2020-12-06 20:35:12+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Amanda K. Glazer'), arxiv.Result.Author('Jacob V. Spertus'), arxiv.Result.Author('Philip B. Stark')]",
1349,Boardroom Voting: Verifiable Voting with Ballot Privacy Using Low-Tech Cryptography in a Single Room,"A boardroom election is an election that takes place in a single room -- the
boardroom -- in which all voters can see and hear each other. We present an
initial exploration of boardroom elections with ballot privacy and voter
verifiability that use only ""low-tech cryptography"" without using computers to
mark or collect ballots. Specifically, we define the problem, introduce several
building blocks, and propose a new protocol that combines these blocks in novel
ways. Our new building blocks include ""foldable ballots"" that can be rotated to
hide the alignment of ballot choices with voting marks, and ""visual secrets""
that are easy to remember and use but hard to describe. Although closely seated
participants in a boardroom election have limited privacy, the protocol ensures
that no one can determine how others voted. Moreover, each voter can verify
that their ballot was correctly cast, collected, and counted, without being
able to prove how they voted, providing assurance against undue influence.
Low-tech cryptography is useful in situations where constituents do not trust
computer technology, and it avoids the complex auditing requirements of
end-to-end cryptographic voting systems such as Pr\^{e}t-\`{a}-Voter. This
paper's building blocks and protocol are meant to be a proof of concept that
might be tested for usability and improved.",2007.14916v2,cs.CR,2020-07-29 15:40:51+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Enka Blanchard'), arxiv.Result.Author('Ted Selker'), arxiv.Result.Author('Alan T. Sherman')]",
1350,Risk-Limiting Audits by Stratified Union-Intersection Tests of Elections (SUITE),"Risk-limiting audits (RLAs) offer a statistical guarantee: if a full manual
tally of the paper ballots would show that the reported election outcome is
wrong, an RLA has a known minimum chance of leading to a full manual tally.
RLAs generally rely on random samples. Stratified sampling--partitioning the
population of ballots into disjoint strata and sampling independently from the
strata--may simplify logistics or increase efficiency compared to simpler
sampling designs, but makes risk calculations harder. We present SUITE, a new
method for conducting RLAs using stratified samples. SUITE considers all
possible partitions of outcome-changing error across strata. For each
partition, it combines P-values from stratum-level tests into a combined
P-value; there is no restriction on the tests used in different strata. SUITE
maximizes the combined P-value over all partitions of outcome-changing error.
The audit can stop if that maximum is less than the risk limit. Voting systems
in some Colorado counties (comprising 98.2% of voters) allow auditors to check
how the system interpreted each ballot, which allows ballot-level comparison
RLAs. Other counties use ballot polling, which is less efficient. Extant
approaches to conducting an RLA of a statewide contest would require major
changes to Colorado's procedures and software, or would sacrifice the
efficiency of ballot-level comparison. SUITE does not. It divides ballots into
two strata: those cast in counties that can conduct ballot-level comparisons,
and the rest. Stratum-level P-values are found by methods derived here. The
resulting audit is substantially more efficient than statewide ballot polling.
SUITE is useful in any state with a mix of voting systems or that uses
stratified sampling for other reasons. We provide an open-source reference
implementation and exemplar calculations in Jupyter notebooks.",1809.04235v1,stat.AP,2018-09-12 02:56:22+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Kellie Ottoboni'), arxiv.Result.Author('Philip B. Stark'), arxiv.Result.Author('Mark Lindeman'), arxiv.Result.Author('Neal McBurnett')]",

1355,Secure Remote Voting Using Paper Ballots,"Internet voting will probably be one of the most significant achievements of
the future information society. It will have an enormous impact on the election
process making it fast, reliable and inexpensive. Nonetheless, so far remote
voting is considered to be very difficult, as one has to take into account
susceptibility of the voter's PC to various cyber-attacks. As a result, most
the research effort is put into developing protocols and machines for poll-site
electronic voting. Although these solutions yield promising results, they
cannot be directly adopted to Internet voting because of secure platform
problem. However, the cryptographic components they utilize may be very useful.
This paper presents a scheme based on combination of mixnets and homomorphic
encryption borrowed from robust poll-site voting, along with techniques
recommended for remote voting -- code sheets and test ballots. The protocol
tries to minimize the trust put in voter's PC by making the voter responsible
for manual encryption of his vote. To achieve this, the voter obtains a paper
ballot that allows him to scramble the vote by performing simple operations
(lookup in a table). Creation of paper ballots, as well as decryption of votes,
is performed by a group of cooperating trusted servers. As a result, the scheme
is characterized by strong asymmetry -- all computations are carried out on the
server side. In consequence it does not require any additional hardware on the
voter's side, and offers distributed trust, receipt-freeness and verifiability.",0804.2349v1,cs.CR,2008-04-15 10:26:40+00:00,[arxiv.Result.Author('Lukasz Nitschke')],
1356,A Unified Evaluation of Two-Candidate Ballot-Polling Election Auditing Methods,"Counting votes is complex and error-prone. Several statistical methods have
been developed to assess election accuracy by manually inspecting randomly
selected physical ballots. Two 'principled' methods are risk-limiting audits
(RLAs) and Bayesian audits (BAs). RLAs use frequentist statistical inference
while BAs are based on Bayesian inference. Until recently, the two have been
thought of as fundamentally different.
  We present results that unify and shed light upon 'ballot-polling' RLAs and
BAs (which only require the ability to sample uniformly at random from all cast
ballot cards) for two-candidate plurality contests, which are building blocks
for auditing more complex social choice functions, including some preferential
voting systems. We highlight the connections between the methods and explore
their performance.
  First, building on a previous demonstration of the mathematical equivalence
of classical and Bayesian approaches, we show that BAs, suitably calibrated,
are risk-limiting. Second, we compare the efficiency of the methods across a
wide range of contest sizes and margins, focusing on the distribution of sample
sizes required to attain a given risk limit. Third, we outline several ways to
improve performance and show how the mathematical equivalence explains the
improvements.",2008.08536v2,stat.AP,2020-08-19 16:30:03+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Zhuoqun Huang'), arxiv.Result.Author('Ronald L. Rivest'), arxiv.Result.Author('Philip B.

1357,Limiting Risk by Turning Manifest Phantoms into Evil Zombies,"Drawing a random sample of ballots to conduct a risk-limiting audit generally
requires knowing how the ballots cast in an election are organized into groups,
for instance, how many containers of ballots there are in all and how many
ballots are in each container. A list of the ballot group identifiers along
with number of ballots in each group is called a ballot manifest. What if the
ballot manifest is not accurate? Surprisingly, even if ballots are known to be
missing from the manifest, it is not necessary to make worst-case assumptions
about those ballots--for instance, to adjust the margin by the number of
missing ballots--to ensure that the audit remains conservative. Rather, it
suffices to make worst-case assumptions about the individual randomly selected
ballots that the audit cannot find. This observation provides a simple
modification to some risk-limiting audit procedures that makes them
automatically become more conservative if the ballot manifest has errors. The
modification--phantoms to evil zombies (~2EZ)--requires only an upper bound on
the total number of ballots cast. ~2EZ makes the audit P-value stochastically
larger than it would be had the manifest been accurate, automatically requiring
more than enough ballots to be audited to offset the manifest errors. This
ensures that the true risk limit remains smaller than the nominal risk limit.
On the other hand, if the manifest is in fact accurate and the upper bound on
the total number of ballots equals the total according to the manifest, ~2EZ
has no effect at all on the number of ballots audited nor on the true risk
limit.",1207.3413v1,stat.AP,2012-07-14 11:26:02+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Jorge H. Banuelos'), arxiv.Result.Author('Philip B. Stark')]",

relations and formulas, which leads to an interesting bijection between ballot
permutations avoiding $132$ and $312$ with left factors of Dyck paths. In
addition, we also conclude the Wilf-classification of ballot permutations

1359,"They may look and look, yet not see: BMDs cannot be tested adequately","Bugs, misconfiguration, and malware can cause ballot-marking devices (BMDs)
to print incorrect votes. Several approaches to testing BMDs have been
proposed. In logic and accuracy testing (LAT) and parallel or live testing,
auditors input known test votes into the BMD and check the printout. Passive
testing monitors the rate of ""spoiled"" BMD printout, on the theory that if BMDs
malfunction, the rate will increase noticeably. We show that these approaches
cannot reliably detect outcome-altering problems, because: (i) The number of
possible interactions with BMDs is enormous, so testing interactions uniformly
at random is hopeless. (ii) To probe the space of interactions intelligently
requires an accurate model of voter behavior, but because the space of
interactions is so large, building an accurate model requires observing a huge
number of voters in every jurisdiction in every election--more voters than
there are in most jurisdictions. (iii) Even with a perfect model of voter
behavior, the number of tests needed exceeds the number of voters in most
jurisdictions. (iv) An attacker can target interactions that are expensive to
test, e.g., because they involve voting slowly; or interactions for which
tampering is less likely to be noticed, e.g., because the voter uses the audio
interface. (v) Whether BMDs misbehave or not, the distribution of spoiled
ballots is unknown and varies by election and possibly by ballot style:
historical data do not help much. Hence, there is no way to calibrate a
threshold for passive testing, e.g., to guarantee at least a 95% chance of
noticing that 5% of the votes were altered, with at most a 5% false alarm rate.
(vi) Even if the distribution of spoiled ballots were known to be Poisson, the
vast majority of jurisdictions do not have enough voters for passive testing to
have a large chance of detecting problems but only a small chance of false
alarms.",1908.08144v4,stat.AP,2019-08-21 23:39:04+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Philip B. Stark'), arxiv.Result.Author('Ran Xie')]",

justifiably high confidence that the reported results of an election are

SOBA combines three ideas: (1) publishing cast vote records (CVRs) separately
for each contest, so that anyone can verify that each reported contest outcome
is correct, if the CVRs reflect voters' intentions with sufficient accuracy;
(2) shrouding a mapping between ballots and the CVRs for those ballots to
prevent the loss of privacy that could occur otherwise; (3) assessing the
accuracy with which the CVRs reflect voters' intentions for a collection of
contests while simultaneously assessing the integrity of the shrouded mapping
between ballots and CVRs by comparing randomly selected ballots to the CVRs
that purport to represent them. Step (1) is related to work by the Humboldt
County Election Transparency Project, but publishing CVRs separately for
individual contests rather than images of entire ballots preserves privacy.
Step (2) requires a cryptographic commitment from elections officials.
Observers participate in step (3), which relies on the ""super-simple
simultaneous single-ballot risk-limiting audit."" Step (3) is designed to reveal
relatively few ballots if the shrouded mapping is proper and the CVRs
accurately reflect voter intent. But if the reported outcomes of the contests
differ from the outcomes that a full hand count would show, step (3) is

this subterfuge. This essay considers how an election administrator can create

material, water and energy consuming, and thus mainly restricted to the
industrial use. Here from an alternative way, the present article demonstrated
for the first time an entirely automatic printing system for personal
electronics manufacturing through introducing a composite liquid metal ink
delivery and printing mechanism to overcome the large surface tension facing
the solution, and integrating it with the notebook computer controlling
algorithm. With the developed printer, any desired electronically conductive
patterns spanning from single wires to various complex structures like
integrated circuit (IC), antenna, PCB, RFID, electronic greeting cards,
decoration arts, classical buildings (White House, Great Wall etc.) or more
do-it-yourself (DIY) circuits were demonstrated to be printed out in a moment
with high precision. And the total cost for the whole system has reached
personal affordability, which is hard to offer by so far the state of the art
technologies. Some fundamental fluid dynamics mechanisms related to the
proposed tapping mode enabled reliable printing and adhesion of the liquid
metal electronics on the flexible substrate was systematically disclosed

systematic bias into election results. This is because, even if the errors are
random, votes for different candidates occur in different patterns that are
affected differently by random errors. In the STV context, the most important
effect of random errors is to invalidate the ballot. This removes far more
votes for those candidates whose supporters tend to list a lot of preferences,
because their ballots are much more likely to be invalidated by random error.
Different validity rules for different voting styles mean that errors are much
more likely to penalise some types of votes than others. For close elections

SOBA combines three ideas: (1) publishing cast vote records (CVRs) separately
for each contest, so that anyone can verify that each reported contest outcome
is correct, if the CVRs reflect voters' intentions with sufficient accuracy;
(2) shrouding a mapping between ballots and the CVRs for those ballots to
prevent the loss of privacy that could occur otherwise; (3) assessing the
accuracy with which the CVRs reflect voters' intentions for a collection of
contests while simultaneously assessing the integrity of the shrouded mapping
between ballots and CVRs by comparing randomly selected ballots to the CVRs
that purport to represent them. Step (1) is related to work by the Humboldt
County Election Transparency Project, but publishing CVRs separately for
individual contests rather than images of entire ballots preserves privacy.
Step (2) requires a cryptographic commitment from elections officials.
Observers participate in step (3), which relies on the ""super-simple
simultaneous single-ballot risk-limiting audit."" Step (3) is designed to reveal
relatively few ballots if the shrouded mapping is proper and the CVRs
accurately reflect voter intent. But if the reported outcomes of the contests

1382,"More style, less work: card-style data decrease risk-limiting audit sample sizes","U.S. elections rely heavily on computers such as voter registration
databases, electronic pollbooks, voting machines, scanners, tabulators, and
results reporting websites. These introduce digital threats to election
outcomes. Risk-limiting audits (RLAs) mitigate threats to some of these systems
by manually inspecting random samples of ballot cards. RLAs have a large chance
of correcting wrong outcomes (by conducting a full manual tabulation of a
trustworthy record of the votes), but can save labor when reported outcomes are
correct. This efficiency is eroded when sampling cannot be targeted to ballot
cards that contain the contest(s) under audit. If the sample is drawn from all
cast cards, RLA sample sizes scale like the reciprocal of the fraction of
ballot cards that contain the contest(s) under audit. That fraction shrinks as
the number of cards per ballot grows (i.e., when elections contain more
contests) and as the fraction of ballots that contain the contest decreases
(i.e., when a smaller percentage of voters are eligible to vote in the
contest). States that conduct RLAs of contests on multi-card ballots or of
small contests can dramatically reduce sample sizes by using information about
which ballot cards contain which contests -- by keeping track of card-style
data (CSD). For instance, CSD reduces the expected number of draws needed to
audit a single countywide contest on a 4-card ballot by 75%. Similarly, CSD
reduces the expected number of draws by 95% or more for an audit of two
contests with the same margin on a 4-card ballot if one contest is on every
ballot and the other is on 10% of ballots. In realistic examples, the savings
can be several orders of magnitude.",2012.03371v1,cs.CR,2020-12-06 20:35:12+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Amanda K. Glazer'), arxiv.Result.Author('Jacob V. Spertus'), arxiv.Result.Author('Philip B. Stark')]",

outcome of the ballot. Electronic voting protocol using cryptography to deliver
in zero trust environments is long overdue. Here I propose using Proof of Work

primitives to build a zero-trust voting system. The state would only issue
single-use voting authorizations to its citizens, while zero trust design would
allow conducting elections by an open-source platform with enhanced

  Our solution provides an attractive balance of security and functional
properties. It is based on well-known cryptographic building blocks and relies
on standard cryptographic assumptions, which allows for relatively simple
security analysis. Our scheme is designed with a built-in fine-grained
distributed trust mechanism based on threshold decryption. It, finally, imposes
only very little additional computational burden on the voting platform, which
is especially important when voters use devices of restricted computational
power such as mobile phones. At the same time, the computational cost on the

has emerged as the preferred voting method during the COVID-19 pandemic. In
this paper, we examine the security of electronic systems used in the process
of voting by mail, including online voter registration and online ballot
tracking systems. The goals of these systems, to facilitate voter registration
and increase public confidence in elections, are laudable. They indisputably
provide a critical public good. It is for these reasons that understanding the
security and privacy posture of the mail-in voting process is paramount. We
find that online voter registration systems in some states have vulnerabilities
that allow adversaries to alter or effectively prevent a voter's registration.
We additionally find that ballot tracking systems raise serious privacy
questions surrounding ease of access to voter data. While the vulnerabilities
discussed here are unlikely to enable an adversary to modify votes, several
could have the effect of disenfranchising voters and reducing voter confidence

expected that random errors should have nearly equal effects on all candidates,
and thus be fair. We find to the contrary that random errors can introduce
systematic bias into election results. This is because, even if the errors are
random, votes for different candidates occur in different patterns that are
affected differently by random errors. In the STV context, the most important
effect of random errors is to invalidate the ballot. This removes far more
votes for those candidates whose supporters tend to list a lot of preferences,
because their ballots are much more likely to be invalidated by random error.
Different validity rules for different voting styles mean that errors are much
more likely to penalise some types of votes than others. For close elections
this systematic bias can change the result of the election.",2007.00854v3,cs.CY,2020-07-02 03:37:48+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Michelle Blom'), arxiv.Result.Author('Andrew Conway'), arxiv.Result.Author('Peter J.

real ballots of any strict subset of districts at a price corresponding to the
willingness to sell on the part of the citizens holding such ballots. By
contrast, decoy voters are trapped into selling their ballots at a low, or even
negligible, price. Blowing up the adversary's budget by introducing decoy

time average spectrum of Sco X-1 has a power law shape without cutoff up to
energies ~200-300 keV. An absence of the high energy cutoff does not agree with
the predictions of a model, in which the tail is formed as a result of
Comptonization of soft seed photons on bulk motion of matter near the compact
object. The amplitude of the tail varies with time with factor more than ten
with the faintest tail at the top of the so-called flaring branch of its
color-color diagram. We show that the minimal amplitude of the power law tail
is recorded when the component, corresponding to the innermost part of

Therefore we show that the presence of the hard X-ray tail may be related with
the existence of the inner part of the optically thick disk. We estimate
cooling time for these energetic electrons and show that they can not be
thermal. We propose that the hard X-ray tail emission originates as a Compton

1421,From self-organization in relativistic electron bunches to coherent synchrotron light: observation using a photonic time-stretch digitizer,"In recent and future synchrotron radiation facilities, relativistic electron
bunches with increasingly high charge density are needed for producing
brilliant light at various wavelengths, from X-rays to terahertz. In such
conditions, interaction of electrons bunches with their own emitted
electromagnetic fields leads to instabilities and spontaneous formation of
complex spatial structures. Understanding these instabilities is therefore key
in most electron accelerators. However, investigations suffer from the lack of
non-destructive recording tools for electron bunch shapes. In storage rings,
most studies thus focus on the resulting emitted radiation. Here, we present
measurements of the electric field in the immediate vicinity of the electron
bunch in a storage ring, over many turns. For recording the ultrafast electric
field, we designed a photonic time-stretch analog-to-digital converter with

1422,Thermochemistry of Alane Complexes for Hydrogen Storage: A Theoretical and Experimental Comparison,"Knowledge of the relative stabilities of alane (AlH3) complexes with electron
donors is essential for identifying hydrogen storage materials for vehicular
applications that can be regenerated by off-board methods; however, almost no
thermodynamic data are available to make this assessment. To fill this gap, we
employed the G4(MP2) method to determine heats of formation, entropies, and
Gibbs free energies of formation for thirty-eight alane complexes with NH3-nRn
(R = Me, Et; n = 0-3), pyridine, pyrazine, triethylenediamine (TEDA),
quinuclidine, OH2-nRn (R = Me, Et; n = 0-2), dioxane, and tetrahydrofuran
(THF). Monomer, bis, and selected dimer complex geometries were considered.
Using these data, we computed the thermodynamics of the key formation and
dehydrogenation reactions that would occur during hydrogen delivery and alane
regeneration, from which trends in complex stability were identified. These
predictions were tested by synthesizing six amine-alane complexes involving
trimethylamine, triethylamine, dimethylethylamine, TEDA, quinuclidine, and
hexamine, and obtaining upper limits of delta G for their formation from
metallic aluminum. Combining these computational and experimental results, we
establish a criterion for complex stability relevant to hydrogen storage that
can be used to assess potential ligands prior to attempting synthesis of the
alane complex. Based on this, we conclude that only a subset of the tertiary
amine complexes considered and none of the ether complexes can be successfully
formed by direct reaction with aluminum and regenerated in an alane-based
hydrogen storage system.",1104.3582v1,physics.chem-ph,2011-04-18 20:10:50+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Bryan M. Wong'), arxiv.Result.Author('David Lacina'), arxiv.Result.Author('Ida M. B.

the interface) from MXene to the TiO2 layer. This interface also has the
strongest adhesion and further strengthened by hydrogen bond formation. For O-,

heterogeneous preferences iteratively forms expert committees whose members are
tasked with the updating of an exogenously given status quo change proposal.
Every individual holds some initial voting power that is represented by a
finite amount of indivisible units with some underlying value. Iterations
happen in three stages. In the first stage, everyone decides which units to
keep for themselves and where to distribute the rest. With every ownership
mutation, a unit's underlying value diminishes by some exogenously given
amount. In the second stage, the deliberative committee is formed by the
individuals with the most accumulated voting power. These experts can author
corrections to the proposal which are proportional to their accumulated power.
In the third stage, if an individual outside of the committee disagrees with a
correction, she can vote against it with their remaining voting power. A
correction is discarded if more than half of the total voting power outside of

constraints among candidates in the latter category. This captures scenarios
where voters have not evaluated all candidates and/or it is unknown where
voters draw the threshold between approved and disapproved candidates. We study
the complexity of some fundamental computational problems for a number of
classic approval-based committee voting rules including Proportional Approval
Voting and Chamberlin--Courant. These problems include that of determining
whether a given set of candidates is a possible or necessary winning committee

a fixed-size set of winners (committee). We propose a natural axiom for this
setting, which we call justified representation (JR). This axiom requires that
if a large enough group of voters exhibits agreement by supporting the same
candidate, then at least one voter in this group has an approved candidate in
the winning committee. We show that for every list of ballots it is possible to
select a committee that provides JR. However, it turns out that several
prominent approval-based voting rules may fail to output such a committee. In
particular, while Proportional Approval Voting (PAV) always outputs a committee
that provides JR, Reweighted Approval Voting (RAV), a tractable approximation
to PAV, does not have this property. We then introduce a stronger version of
the JR axiom, which we call extended justified representation (EJR), and show
that PAV satisfies EJR, while other rules we consider do not; indeed, EJR can
be used to characterize PAV within the class of weighted PAV rules. We also
consider several other questions related to JR and EJR, including the
relationship between JR/EJR and core stability, and the complexity of the
associated algorithmic problems.",1407.8269v4,cs.MA,2014-07-31 03:51:34+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Haris Aziz'), arxiv.Result.Author('Markus Brill'), arxiv.Result.Author('Vincent Conitzer'), arxiv.Result.Author('Edith Elkind'), arxiv.Result.Author('Rupert Freeman'), arxiv.Result.Author('Toby Walsh')]",

went beyond a simple vote-counting and were based on proxy voting. These
mechanisms generated a high level of representativeness of the selected
committee, weakening the possibility of relations of patronage. By
incorporating the integrity of individuals and its perception, here we address
the question of the trustability of the resulting committee. Our results show
that this voting rule provides high representativeness for small committees

voting rules such as Proportional Approval Voting (PAV) and Phragm\'en's rules
have been shown to produce committees that are proportional, in the sense that
they proportionally represent voters' preferences; all of these rules are
strategically manipulable by voters. On the other hand, a generalisation of
Approval Voting gives a non-proportional but strategyproof voting rule. We show
that there is a fundamental tradeoff between these two properties: we prove
that no multiwinner voting rule can simultaneously satisfy a weak form of
proportionality (a weakening of justified representation) and a weak form of
strategyproofness. Our impossibility is obtained using a formulation of the
problem in propositional logic and applying SAT solvers; a human-readable

unsatisfiable set (MUS). We also discuss several related axiomatic questions in

committee of elected block producers. In theory, the smaller the committee, the
faster the blockchain can reach consensus and the more it can scale. What's
less clear, is whether such protocols ensure that honest committees can be
consistently elected, given blockchain users typically have limited information
on who to vote for. We show that the approval voting mechanism underlying most
CBC protocols is complex and can lead to intractable optimal voting strategies.
We empirically characterize some simpler intuitive voting strategies that users
tend to resort to in practice and prove that these nonetheless converge to
optimality exponentially quickly in the number of voters. Exponential
convergence ensures that despite its complexity, CBC exhibits robustness and
has some efficiency advantages over more popular staked-weighted lottery

effectiveness, we propose to employ new noise models that are specifically
tailored for approval votes and committees. These models take as input a ground
truth committee and return random approval votes to be thought of as noisy
estimates of the ground truth. A minimum robustness requirement for an
approval-based multiwinner voting rule is to return the ground truth when
applied to profiles with sufficiently many noisy votes. Our results indicate
that approval-based multiwinner voting is always robust to reasonable noise. We
further refine this finding by presenting a hierarchy of rules in terms of how
robust to noise they are.",2002.01776v2,cs.AI,2020-02-05 13:17:43+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Ioannis Caragiannis'), arxiv.Result.Author('Christos Kaklamanis'), arxiv.Result.Author('Nikos Karanikolas'), arxiv.Result.Author('George A. Krimpas')]",

satisfaction of voters comes from the final decisions made by the elected

committee to make these final decisions, different multi-winner election rules
are most suitable for electing the committee. Furthermore, we show that if we

decisions, to depend on the voters' preferences, we can obtain an even better

1456,Heuristics in Multi-Winner Approval Voting,"In many real world situations, collective decisions are made using voting.
Moreover, scenarios such as committee or board elections require voting rules
that return multiple winners. In multi-winner approval voting (AV), an agent
may vote for as many candidates as they wish. Winners are chosen by tallying up
the votes and choosing the top-$k$ candidates receiving the most votes. An
agent may manipulate the vote to achieve a better outcome by voting in a way
that does not reflect their true preferences. In complex and uncertain
situations, agents may use heuristics to strategize, instead of incurring the
additional effort required to compute the manipulation which most favors them.
In this paper, we examine voting behavior in multi-winner approval voting
scenarios with complete information. We show that people generally manipulate
their vote to obtain a better outcome, but often do not identify the optimal
manipulation. Instead, voters tend to prioritize the candidates with the
highest utilities. Using simulations, we demonstrate the effectiveness of these
heuristics in situations where agents only have access to partial information.",1905.12104v2,cs.GT,2019-05-28 21:44:07+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Jaelle Scheuerman'), arxiv.Result.Author('Jason L. Harman'), arxiv.Result.Author('Nicholas Mattei'), arxiv.Result.Author('K. Brent Venable')]",

explosion in the number of committee selection methods in the literature.
Committee selection mechanisms allow consensus protocols to safely select a
committee, or a small subset of validators that is permitted to vote and verify
a block of transactions, in a distributed ledger. There are many such
mechanisms, each with substantially different methodologies and guarantees on
communication complexity, resource usage, and fairness. In this paper, we
illustrate that, despite these implementation-level differences, there are
strong statistical similarities between committee selection mechanisms. We
concretely show this by proving that the committee selection of the Avalanche
consensus protocol can be used to choose committees in the Stellar Consensus
Protocol that satisfy the necessary and sufficient conditions for Byzantine
agreement. We also verify these claims using simulations and numerically
observe sharp phase transitions as a function of protocol parameters. Our
results suggest the existence of a ""statistical taxonomy"" of committee

between committee size and representatives exists in the form of an inverse
square root law and that the normalized committee size approximately scales
with the inverse of the community size, allowing the scalability to very large
populations. These findings are not strongly influenced by the different
networks used to describe the individuals interactions, except for the presence

There are many existing protocols for voting using smart contracts. We observe

the future information society. It will have an enormous impact on the election
process making it fast, reliable and inexpensive. Nonetheless, so far remote

susceptibility of the voter's PC to various cyber-attacks. As a result, most
the research effort is put into developing protocols and machines for poll-site
electronic voting. Although these solutions yield promising results, they
cannot be directly adopted to Internet voting because of secure platform
problem. However, the cryptographic components they utilize may be very useful.
This paper presents a scheme based on combination of mixnets and homomorphic
encryption borrowed from robust poll-site voting, along with techniques
recommended for remote voting -- code sheets and test ballots. The protocol
tries to minimize the trust put in voter's PC by making the voter responsible
for manual encryption of his vote. To achieve this, the voter obtains a paper
ballot that allows him to scramble the vote by performing simple operations
(lookup in a table). Creation of paper ballots, as well as decryption of votes,
is performed by a group of cooperating trusted servers. As a result, the scheme
is characterized by strong asymmetry -- all computations are carried out on the
server side. In consequence it does not require any additional hardware on the

Equally, we discard any hypothesis that implies altering some machines and not
others, at each electoral precinct, because the variation patterns between
machines at each precinct are normal. However, the statistical evidence is
compatible with the occurrence of fraud that has affected every machine in a
single precinct, but differentially more in some precincts than others. We find
that the deviation pattern between precincts, based on the relationship between
the signatures collected to request the referendum in November 2003 (the

However, insufficient materials data usually leads to a poor performance. Here,
we develop a new voting data-driven method that could generally improve the
performance of regression learning model for accurately predicting properties

two-dimensional hexagonal binary compounds focusing on ferroelectric properties
and find that the performance of the model for electric polarization is indeed
greatly improved, where 38 stable ferroelectrics with out-of-plane polarization
including 31 metals and 7 semiconductors are screened out. By an unsupervised
learning, actionable information such as how the number and orbital radius of
valence electrons, ionic polarizability, and electronegativity of constituent

assuming the adversarial observer has uncertainty about individual votes, even
publishing the histogram of votes achieves good DDP. Second, we introduce the
notion of exact privacy to compare the privacy preserved in various

consensus among researchers of how people vote strategically, even in simple
voting settings. This paper addresses this gap by comparing different
approaches that have been used to model strategic voting, including expected
utility maximization, heuristic decisionmaking, and bounded rationality models.
The models are applied to data collected from hundreds of people in controlled
voting experiments, where people vote after observing non-binding poll
information. We introduce a new voting model, the Attainability- Utility (AU)
heuristic, which weighs the popularity of a candidate according to the poll,
with the utility of the candidate to the voter. We argue that the AU model is
cognitively plausible, and show that it is able to predict peoples voting
behavior significantly better than other models from the literature. It was
almost at par with (and sometimes better than) a machine learning algorithm
that uses substantially more information. Our results provide new insights into

dishonest and did not correctly process his ballot while the authority claims

unambiguously determine who is right. We systematically characterize all
relevant disputes for a generic, practically relevant, class of voting
protocols. Based on our characterization, we propose a new definition of
dispute resolution for voting that accounts for the possibility that both
voters and the voting authority can make false claims and that voters may
abstain from voting.
  A central aspect of our work is timeliness: a voter should possess the
evidence required to resolve disputes no later than the election's end. We
characterize what assumptions are necessary and sufficient for timeliness in
terms of a communication topology for our voting protocol class. We formalize
the dispute resolution properties and communication topologies symbolically.
This provides the basis for verification of dispute resolution for a broad
class of protocols. To demonstrate the utility of our model, we analyze a
mixnet-based voting protocol and prove that it satisfies dispute resolution as
well as verifiability and receipt-freeness. To prove our claims, we combine

Chaum's work on code voting assumed voting codes are physically delivered to
voters using the mail system, implicitly requiring to trust the mail system.
This is not necessarily a valid assumption to make - especially if the mail
system cannot be trusted. When conspiring with the recipient of the cast
ballots, privacy is broken.
  It is clear to the public that when it comes to privacy, computers and
""secure"" communication over the Internet cannot fully be trusted. This
emphasizes the importance of using: (1) Unconditional security for secure
network communication. (2) Reduce reliance on untrusted computers.
  In this paper we explore how to remove the mail system trust assumption in
code voting. We use PSMT protocols (SCN 2012) where with the help of visual
aids, humans can carry out $\mod 10$ addition correctly with a 99\% degree of
accuracy. We introduce an unconditionally secure MIX based on the combinatorics

Whether for safety or reliability, each vulnerability is quantified by three

electronic voting puts forward some difficulties regarding the voter anonymity,

brings a new secure mechanism of safe and transparent voting. In this paper, a

election process from keeping the privacy of the voter, casting a vote with the
possibility to check if it was counted correctly to publishing the results. The
result of the paper will give a new approach to extend the target of the
election from small scale to large scale despite the fact of Ethereum

1503,$Laoco\ddot{o}n$: Scalable and Portable Receipt-free E-voting Protocol without Untappable Channels,"Vote-buying and voter-coercion are the impending threats when deploying
remote online voting into large scale elections. With a policy of carrot and
stick, it will encourage voters to deviate from honest voting strategy and
spoil the democratic election. To deal with this problem, many voting protocols
proposed their solutions with the notion of receipt-freeness. However, existing
receipt-free voting protocols either rely on some impractical assumptions as
untappable communication channel, or are burden with heavy voter-side
computation and quadratic tallying complexity. In this paper, we present
$Laoco\ddot{o}n$, a brand new cryptographic voting protocol which is practical
and light-weight to be deployed in large scale online elections. By taking
advantage of proxy re-encryption, our protocol can defend vote-buying attacks.
Furthermore, we introduce a new property, candidate-adaptiveness, in electronic
voting which refers to as every candidate knows the real-time vote number
towards himself, while he knows nothing about others, nor he buys votes. We

1514,Secure Remote Voting Using Paper Ballots,"Internet voting will probably be one of the most significant achievements of
the future information society. It will have an enormous impact on the election
process making it fast, reliable and inexpensive. Nonetheless, so far remote
voting is considered to be very difficult, as one has to take into account
susceptibility of the voter's PC to various cyber-attacks. As a result, most
the research effort is put into developing protocols and machines for poll-site
electronic voting. Although these solutions yield promising results, they
cannot be directly adopted to Internet voting because of secure platform
problem. However, the cryptographic components they utilize may be very useful.
This paper presents a scheme based on combination of mixnets and homomorphic
encryption borrowed from robust poll-site voting, along with techniques
recommended for remote voting -- code sheets and test ballots. The protocol
tries to minimize the trust put in voter's PC by making the voter responsible
for manual encryption of his vote. To achieve this, the voter obtains a paper
ballot that allows him to scramble the vote by performing simple operations
(lookup in a table). Creation of paper ballots, as well as decryption of votes,
is performed by a group of cooperating trusted servers. As a result, the scheme
is characterized by strong asymmetry -- all computations are carried out on the
server side. In consequence it does not require any additional hardware on the
voter's side, and offers distributed trust, receipt-freeness and verifiability.",0804.2349v1,cs.CR,2008-04-15 10:26:40+00:00,[arxiv.Result.Author('Lukasz Nitschke')],

1520,Limiting Risk by Turning Manifest Phantoms into Evil Zombies,"Drawing a random sample of ballots to conduct a risk-limiting audit generally
requires knowing how the ballots cast in an election are organized into groups,
for instance, how many containers of ballots there are in all and how many
ballots are in each container. A list of the ballot group identifiers along
with number of ballots in each group is called a ballot manifest. What if the
ballot manifest is not accurate? Surprisingly, even if ballots are known to be
missing from the manifest, it is not necessary to make worst-case assumptions
about those ballots--for instance, to adjust the margin by the number of
missing ballots--to ensure that the audit remains conservative. Rather, it
suffices to make worst-case assumptions about the individual randomly selected
ballots that the audit cannot find. This observation provides a simple
modification to some risk-limiting audit procedures that makes them
automatically become more conservative if the ballot manifest has errors. The
modification--phantoms to evil zombies (~2EZ)--requires only an upper bound on
the total number of ballots cast. ~2EZ makes the audit P-value stochastically
larger than it would be had the manifest been accurate, automatically requiring
more than enough ballots to be audited to offset the manifest errors. This
ensures that the true risk limit remains smaller than the nominal risk limit.
On the other hand, if the manifest is in fact accurate and the upper bound on
the total number of ballots equals the total according to the manifest, ~2EZ
has no effect at all on the number of ballots audited nor on the true risk
limit.",1207.3413v1,stat.AP,2012-07-14 11:26:02+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Jorge H. Banuelos'), arxiv.Result.Author('Philip B. Stark')]",

changes from the slate they used to vote. Overall accuracy was exceptionally
high. Participants saw 1440 total contests, and of those 1440, there were a
total of 4 errors, so total accuracy was 99.8%. Participants were able to
perform with near-perfect accuracy regardless of ballot length, ballot type,
number of altered races, and location of altered races. Detection performance
was extremely robust. We conclude that with proper direction and resources,
voters can be near-perfect detectors of ballot changes on printed paper ballots

not require identification numbers on the ballots or counting many ballots per

justifiably high confidence that the reported results of an election are

SOBA combines three ideas: (1) publishing cast vote records (CVRs) separately
for each contest, so that anyone can verify that each reported contest outcome
is correct, if the CVRs reflect voters' intentions with sufficient accuracy;
(2) shrouding a mapping between ballots and the CVRs for those ballots to
prevent the loss of privacy that could occur otherwise; (3) assessing the
accuracy with which the CVRs reflect voters' intentions for a collection of
contests while simultaneously assessing the integrity of the shrouded mapping
between ballots and CVRs by comparing randomly selected ballots to the CVRs
that purport to represent them. Step (1) is related to work by the Humboldt
County Election Transparency Project, but publishing CVRs separately for
individual contests rather than images of entire ballots preserves privacy.
Step (2) requires a cryptographic commitment from elections officials.
Observers participate in step (3), which relies on the ""super-simple

relatively few ballots if the shrouded mapping is proper and the CVRs
accurately reflect voter intent. But if the reported outcomes of the contests

malware. A malicious BMD might produce a printed ballot that disagrees with a

this subterfuge. This essay considers how an election administrator can create
reasonable auditing procedures to gain confidence that their fleet of BMDs is

accessibility features of BMDs while the overall election still benefits from
the same security and reliability properties we expect from hand-marked paper

1531,"More style, less work: card-style data decrease risk-limiting audit sample sizes","U.S. elections rely heavily on computers such as voter registration
databases, electronic pollbooks, voting machines, scanners, tabulators, and
results reporting websites. These introduce digital threats to election
outcomes. Risk-limiting audits (RLAs) mitigate threats to some of these systems
by manually inspecting random samples of ballot cards. RLAs have a large chance
of correcting wrong outcomes (by conducting a full manual tabulation of a
trustworthy record of the votes), but can save labor when reported outcomes are
correct. This efficiency is eroded when sampling cannot be targeted to ballot
cards that contain the contest(s) under audit. If the sample is drawn from all
cast cards, RLA sample sizes scale like the reciprocal of the fraction of
ballot cards that contain the contest(s) under audit. That fraction shrinks as
the number of cards per ballot grows (i.e., when elections contain more
contests) and as the fraction of ballots that contain the contest decreases
(i.e., when a smaller percentage of voters are eligible to vote in the
contest). States that conduct RLAs of contests on multi-card ballots or of
small contests can dramatically reduce sample sizes by using information about
which ballot cards contain which contests -- by keeping track of card-style
data (CSD). For instance, CSD reduces the expected number of draws needed to
audit a single countywide contest on a 4-card ballot by 75%. Similarly, CSD
reduces the expected number of draws by 95% or more for an audit of two
contests with the same margin on a 4-card ballot if one contest is on every
ballot and the other is on 10% of ballots. In realistic examples, the savings
can be several orders of magnitude.",2012.03371v1,cs.CR,2020-12-06 20:35:12+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Amanda K. Glazer'), arxiv.Result.Author('Jacob V. Spertus'), arxiv.Result.Author('Philip B. Stark')]",

1534,Non(c)esuch Ballot-Level Risk-Limiting Audits for Precinct-Count Voting Systems,"Risk-limiting audits (RLAs) guarantee a high probability of correcting
incorrect reported outcomes before the outcomes are certified. The most
efficient use ballot-level comparison, comparing the voting system's
interpretation of individual ballot cards sampled at random (cast-vote records,
CVRs) from a trustworthy paper trail to a human interpretation of the same
cards. Such comparisons require the voting system to create and export CVRs in
a way that can be linked to the individual ballots the CVRs purport to
represent. Such links can be created by keeping the ballots in the order in
which they are scanned or by printing a unique serial number on each ballot.
But for precinct-count systems (PCOS), these strategies may compromise vote
anonymity: the order in which ballots are cast may identify the voters who cast
them. Printing a unique pseudo-random number (""cryptographic nonce"") on each
ballot card after the voter last touches it could reduce such privacy risks.
But what if the system does not in fact print a unique number on each ballot or
does not accurately report the numbers it printed? This paper gives two ways to
conduct an RLA so that even if the system does not print a genuine nonce on
each ballot or misreports the nonces it used, the audit's risk limit is not
compromised (however, the anonymity of votes might be compromised). One method
allows untrusted technology to be used to imprint and to retrieve ballot cards.
The method is adaptive: if the technology behaves properly, this protection
does not increase the audit workload. But if the imprinting or retrieval system
misbehaves, the sample size the RLA requires to confirm the reported results
when the results are correct is generally larger than if the imprinting and
retrieval were accurate.",2207.01362v1,cs.CR,2022-07-04 12:35:42+00:00,[arxiv.Result.Author('Philip B. Stark')],

As corollaries, we obtain several formulas for the bivariate generating

1536,Adaptive Risk-Limiting Ballot Comparison Audits,"Risk-limiting audits (RLAs) are rigorous statistical procedures meant to
detect invalid election results. RLAs examine paper ballots cast during the
election to statistically assess the possibility of a disagreement between the
winner determined by the ballots and the winner reported by tabulation. The
most ballot efficient approaches proceed by ""ballot comparison."" However,
ballot comparison requires an untrusted declaration of the contents of each
cast ballot, rather than a simple tabulation of vote totals. This ""cast-vote
record table"" (CVR) is then spot-checked against ballots for consistency. In
many practical settings, the cost of generating a suitable CVR dominates the
cost of conducting the audit, preventing widespread adoption of these
sample-efficient techniques.
  We introduce a new RLA procedure: an ""adaptive ballot comparison"" audit. In
this audit, a global CVR is never produced; instead, a three-stage procedure is
iterated:
  1) a batch is selected,
  2) a CVR is produced for that batch, and
  3) a ballot within the batch is sampled, inspected by auditors, and compared
with the CVR.
  We prove that such an audit can achieve risk commensurate with standard
comparison audits while generating a fraction of the CVR. We present three main
contributions:
  1) a formal adversarial model for RLAs;
  2) definition and analysis of an adaptive audit procedure with rigorous risk
limits and an associated correctness analysis accounting for the incidental
errors arising in typical audits; and
  3) an analysis of practical efficiency.
  This method can be organized in rounds (as is typical for comparison audits)
where sampled CVRs are produced in parallel. Using data from Florida's 2020
presidential election with 5% risk and 1% margin, only 22% of the CVR is
generated; at 10% margin, only 2% is generated.",2202.02607v5,cs.CR,2022-02-05 18:04:27+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Benjamin Fuller'), arxiv.Result.Author('Abigail Harrison'), arxiv.Result.Author('Alexander Russell')]",
1537,Sets of Half-Average Nulls Generate Risk-Limiting Audits: SHANGRLA,"Risk-limiting audits (RLAs) for many social choice functions can be reduced
to testing sets of null hypotheses of the form ""the average of this list is not
greater than 1/2"" for a collection of finite lists of nonnegative numbers. Such
social choice functions include majority, super-majority, plurality,
multi-winner plurality, Instant Runoff Voting (IRV), Borda count, approval
voting, and STAR-Voting, among others. The audit stops without a full hand
count iff all the null hypotheses are rejected. The nulls can be tested in many
ways. Ballot-polling is particularly simple; two new ballot-polling
risk-measuring functions for sampling without replacement are given.
Ballot-level comparison audits transform each null into an equivalent assertion
that the mean of re-scaled tabulation errors is not greater than 1/2. In turn,
that null can then be tested using the same statistical methods used for ballot
polling---but applied to different finite lists of nonnegative numbers.
SHANGRLA comparison audits are more efficient than previous comparison audits
for two reasons: (i) for most social choice functions, the conditions tested
are both necessary and sufficient for the reported outcome to be correct, while
previous methods tested conditions that were sufficient but not necessary, and
(ii) the tests avoid a conservative approximation. The SHANGRLA abstraction
simplifies stratified audits, including audits that combine ballot polling with
ballot-level comparisons, producing sharper audits than the ""SUITE"" approach.
SHANGRLA works with the ""phantoms to evil zombies"" strategy to treat missing
ballot cards and missing or redacted cast vote records. That also facilitates
sampling from ""ballot-style manifests,"" which can dramatically improve
efficiency when the audited contests do not appear on every ballot card.

1539,How long is a piece of string? An exploration of multi-winner approval voting and ballot-length restrictions,"Multi-winner approval elections are seen in a variety of settings ranging
from academic societies and associations to public elections. In such
elections, it is often the case that ballot-length restrictions are enforced;
that is, where voters have a limit on the number of candidates which they can
vote for. Despite this common feature, there does not seem to be any
theoretical justification for ballot-length restrictions (Laslier and Van der
Straeten, 2016).
  This work endogenously derives the set of voter best-response ballot lengths
under complete information and with general assumptions on voter utilities and
voting rules. These results provide justification for some ballot-length
restrictions observed in practice, however when considering equilibrium
outcomes our analysis shows that this justification is no longer valid.
Equilibrium analysis is considered for voters with lazy and truth-bias
second-order tendencies and the equilibrium solution concept is pure-Nash
equilibria.
  The key insights show that ballot-length restrictions or institutional
features which make voting costly may lead to instability in election outcomes
when voters have diverse preferences, via the non-existence of equilibria. On
the other hand, when equilibria do exist they satisfy desirable properties
which are not guaranteed by equilibria attained under costless voting and in
the absence of ballot-length restrictions. In summary our results highlight a
stark trade-off between stable and desirable election outcomes.",1711.05092v1,cs.GT,2017-11-14 14:12:57+00:00,[arxiv.Result.Author('Barton E. Lee')],

Moreover, the payment transaction itself serves as a timestamped receipt for
the customer. It proves what has been paid for and who received the funds,
again without relying on any merchant signatures. In particular, funds and
receipt are exchanged in a single atomic action. The asymmetric nature of the
customer-merchant relation is crucial.

classes of infinite polycyclic groups that remain suitable for cryptography.
The analysis of algorithms for search and decision problems in polycyclic
groups has also been developed. In addition to results for the aforementioned

morphisms, and orbit decidability. Though much progress has been made, many

1559,Identifying Cache-Based Side Channels through Secret-Augmented Abstract Interpretation,"Cache-based side channels enable a dedicated attacker to reveal program
secrets by measuring the cache access patterns. Practical attacks have been
shown against real-world crypto algorithm implementations such as RSA, AES, and
ElGamal. By far, identifying information leaks due to cache-based side
channels, either in a static or dynamic manner, remains a challenge: the
existing approaches fail to offer high precision, full coverage, and good
scalability simultaneously, thus impeding their practical use in real-world
scenarios.
  In this paper, we propose a novel static analysis method on binaries to
detect cache-based side channels. We use abstract interpretation to reason on
program states with respect to abstract values at each program point. To make
such abstract interpretation scalable to real-world cryptosystems while
offering high precision and full coverage, we propose a novel abstract domain
called the Secret-Augmented Symbolic domain (SAS). SAS tracks program secrets
and dependencies on them for precision, while it tracks only coarse-grained
public information for scalability.
  We have implemented the proposed technique into a practical tool named CacheS
and evaluated it on the implementations of widely-used cryptographic algorithms
in real-world crypto libraries, including Libgcrypt, OpenSSL, and mbedTLS.
CacheS successfully confirmed a total of 154 information leaks reported by
previous research and 54 leaks that were previously unknown. We have reported
our findings to the developers. And they confirmed that many of those unknown

1565,(Universal) Unconditional Verifiability in E-Voting without Trusted Parties,"In traditional e-voting protocols, privacy is often provided by a trusted
authority that learns the votes and computes the tally. Some protocols replace
the trusted authority by a set of authorities, and privacy is guaranteed if
less than a threshold number of authorities are corrupt. For verifiability,
stronger security guarantees are demanded. Typically, corrupt authorities that
try to fake the result of the tally must always be detected.
  To provide verifiability, many e-voting protocols use Non-Interactive
Zero-Knowledge proofs (NIZKs). Thanks to their non-interactive nature, NIZKs
allow anybody, including third parties that do not participate in the protocol,
to verify the correctness of the tally. Therefore, NIZKs can be used to obtain
universal verifiability. Additionally, NIZKs also improve usability because
they allow voters to cast a vote using a non-interactive protocol.
  The disadvantage of NIZKs is that their security is based on setup
assumptions such as the common reference string (CRS) or the random oracle (RO)
model. The former requires a trusted party for the generation of a common
reference string. The latter, though a popular methodology for designing secure
protocols, has been shown to be unsound.
  In this paper, we address the design of an e-voting protocol that provides
verifiability without any trust assumptions, where verifiability here is meant
without eligibility verification. We show that Non-Interactive
Witness-Indistinguishable proofs (NIWI) can be used for this purpose. The
e-voting scheme is private under the Decision Linear assumption, while
verifiability holds unconditionally. To our knowledge, this is the first
private e-voting scheme with perfect universal verifiability, i.e. one in which
the probability of a fake tally not being detected is 0, and with {\em
non-interactive} protocols that does not rely on trust assumptions.",1610.06343v1,cs.CR,2016-10-20 09:57:12+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Gina Gallegos-Garcia'), arxiv.Result.Author('Vincenzo Iovino'), arxiv.Result.Author('Alfredo Rial'), arxiv.Result.Author('Peter B.

Cryptographic techniques are deployed to construct identity proofs across the

  In this paper, we design a privacy-preserving identity protocol called
""zkFaith."" A new approach to obtain a verified zero-knowledge identity unique

provided by the individuals and issues a zero-knowledge-based id without

users with a zero-knowledge proof system can prove that they own the required
attributes of the access criterion of the requested service providers. Vector
commitment and their position binding property enables us to, later on, update
the commitments based on the modification of the personal data; hence update

verify only one of the attributes.
  To investigate its fundamental limits, we introduce an information theoretic
DAPAC framework, with $N \in \mathbb{N}$, $N\geq 2$, replicated non-colluding
servers (authorities) and some users. Each user has an attribute vector
$\mathbf{v^*}=(v_1^*, ..., v_N^*)$ of dimension $N$ and is eligible to retrieve
a message $W^{\mathbf{v}^*}$, available in all servers. Each server $n\in [N]$
is able to only observe and verify the $n$'th attribute of a user. In response,
it sends a function of its data to the user. The system must satisfy the
following conditions: (1) Correctness: the user with attribute vector
$\mathbf{v^*}$ is able to retrieve his intended message $W^{\mathbf{v}^*}$ from
the servers' response, (2) Data Secrecy: the user will not learn anything about
the other messages, (3) Attribute Privacy: each Server~$n$ learns nothing
beyond attribute $n$ of the user. The capacity of the DAPAC is defined as the
ratio of the file size and the aggregated size of the responses, maximized over

robots to perform complex tasks. Because methods that directly reuse the stored

method is well known as an online learning technique for improving sample
efficiency in traditional reinforcement learning with linear regressors rather
than DRL. The dependency between parameters of deep neural networks would
destroy the eligibility traces, which is why they are not integrated with DRL.
Although replacing the gradient with the most influential one rather than
accumulating the gradients as the eligibility traces can alleviate this
problem, the replacing operation reduces the number of reuses of previous
experiences. To address these issues, this study proposes a new eligibility
traces method that can be used even in DRL while maintaining high sample
efficiency. When the accumulated gradients differ from those computed using the
latest parameters, the proposed method takes into account the divergence
between the past and latest parameters to adaptively decay the eligibility
traces. Bregman divergences between outputs computed by the past and latest
parameters are exploited due to the infeasible computational cost of the
divergence between the past and latest parameters. In addition, a generalized

1581,Ballot stuffing and participation privacy in pollsite voting,"We study the problem of simultaneously addressing both ballot stuffing and
participation privacy for pollsite voting systems. Ballot stuffing is the
attack where fake ballots (not cast by any eligible voter) are inserted into
the system. Participation privacy is about hiding which eligible voters have
actually cast their vote. So far, the combination of ballot stuffing and
participation privacy has been mostly studied for internet voting, where voters
are assumed to own trusted computing devices. Such approaches are inapplicable
to pollsite voting where voters typically vote bare handed. We present an
eligibility audit protocol to detect ballot stuffing in pollsite voting
protocols. This is done while protecting participation privacy from a remote
observer - one who does not physically observe voters during voting. Our
protocol can be instantiated as an additional layer on top of most existing
pollsite E2E-V voting protocols. To achieve our guarantees, we develop an
efficient zero-knowledge proof (ZKP), that, given a value $v$ and a set $\Phi$
of commitments, proves $v$ is committed by some commitment in $\Phi$, without
revealing which one. We call this a ZKP of reverse set membership because of
its relationship to the popular ZKPs of set membership. This ZKP may be of
independent interest.",2210.14833v1,cs.CR,2022-10-26 16:29:23+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Prashant Agrawal'), arxiv.Result.Author('Abhinav Nakarmi'), arxiv.Result.Author('Mahabir Prasad Jhanwar'), arxiv.Result.Author('Subodh Sharma'), arxiv.Result.Author('Subhashis Banerjee')]",

incarceration on voting from jail was much larger for Black registered voters,
who were 78% less likely to vote in 2020 if booked into county jails for the
full duration of 2020 voting days, relative to Black registered voters booked
into the same jails just after Election Day. Placebo tests indicate no effects
of 2020 jail incarceration on the 2012 or 2016 turnout of registered voters. We
find inconsistent effects of jail incarceration on voter registration in 2020,

registration status. Our findings reveal the pressing need to enable
voting-eligible incarcerated individuals to exercise their constitutional right
to vote, and to address troubling racial disparities in the effect of jail

1583,Tradeoffs in Hierarchical Voting Systems,"Condorcet's jury theorem states that the correct outcome is reached in direct
majority voting systems with sufficiently large electorates as long as each
voter's independent probability of voting for that outcome is greater than 0.5.
Yet, in situations where direct voting systems are infeasible, such as due to
high implementation and infrastructure costs, hierarchical voting systems
provide a reasonable alternative. We study differences in outcome precision
between hierarchical and direct voting systems for varying group sizes,
abstention rates, and voter competencies. Using asymptotic expansions of the
derivative of the reliability function (or Banzhaf number), we first prove that
indirect systems differ most from their direct counterparts when group size and
number are equal to each other, and therefore to $\sqrt{N_{\rm d}}$, where
$N_{\rm d}$ is the total number of voters in the direct system. In multitier
systems, we prove that this difference is maximized when group size equals
$\sqrt[n]{N_{\rm d}}$, where $n$ is the number of hierarchical levels. Second,
we show that while direct majority rule always outperforms hierarchical voting
for homogeneous electorates that vote with certainty, as group numbers and size
increase, hierarchical majority voting gains in its ability to represent all
eligible voters. Furthermore, when voter abstention and competency are
correlated within groups, hierarchical systems often outperform direct voting,
which we show by using a generating function approach that is able to
analytically characterize heterogeneous voting systems.",2110.02298v1,math.CO,2021-10-05 19:01:52+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Lucas Böttcher'), arxiv.Result.Author('Georgia Kernell')]","Collect. Intell. 1, 1--16 (2022)"

state databases containing information about which citizens are eligible to
vote. Administrators at the state and local level are faced with the
exceedingly difficult task of ensuring that each of their jurisdictions is
properly managed, while also monitoring for improper modifications to the
database. Monitoring changes to Voter Registration Files (VRFs) is crucial,
given that a malicious actor wishing to disrupt the democratic process in the
US would be well-advised to manipulate the contents of these files in order to
achieve their goals. In 2020, we saw election officials perform admirably when
faced with administering one of the most contentious elections in US history,
but much work remains to secure and monitor the election systems Americans rely
on. Using data created by comparing snapshots taken of VRFs over time, we
present a set of methods that make use of machine learning to ease the burden
on analysts and administrators in protecting voter rolls. We first evaluate the
effectiveness of multiple unsupervised anomaly detection methods in detecting
VRF modifications by modeling anomalous changes as sparse additive noise. In
this setting we determine that statistical models comparing administrative
districts within a short time span and non-negative matrix factorization are
most effective for surfacing anomalous events for review. These methods were
deployed during 2019-2020 in our organization's monitoring system and were used
in collaboration with the office of the Iowa Secretary of State. Additionally,

1585,Influencing elections with statistics: Targeting voters with logistic regression trees,"In political campaigning substantial resources are spent on voter
mobilization, that is, on identifying and influencing as many people as
possible to vote. Campaigns use statistical tools for deciding whom to target
(""microtargeting""). In this paper we describe a nonpartisan campaign that aims
at increasing overall turnout using the example of the 2004 US presidential
election. Based on a real data set of 19,634 eligible voters from Ohio, we
introduce a modern statistical framework well suited for carrying out the main
tasks of voter targeting in a single sweep: predicting an individual's turnout
(or support) likelihood for a particular cause, party or candidate as well as
data-driven voter segmentation. Our framework, which we refer to as LORET (for
LOgistic REgression Trees), contains standard methods such as logistic
regression and classification trees as special cases and allows for a synthesis
of both techniques. For our case study, we explore various LORET models with
different regressors in the logistic model components and different
partitioning variables in the tree components; we analyze them in terms of
their predictive accuracy and compare the effect of using the full set of
available variables against using only a limited amount of information. We find
that augmenting a standard set of variables (such as age and voting history)
with additional predictor variables (such as the household composition in terms
of party affiliation) clearly improves predictive accuracy. We also find that
LORET models based on tree induction beat the unpartitioned models.
Furthermore, we illustrate how voter segmentation arises from our framework and
discuss the resulting profiles from a targeting point of view.",1311.7326v1,stat.AP,2013-11-28 14:21:41+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Thomas Rusch'), arxiv.Result.Author('Ilro Lee'), arxiv.Result.Author('Kurt Hornik'), arxiv.Result.Author('Wolfgang Jank'), arxiv.Result.Author('Achim Zeileis')]","Annals of Applied Statistics 2013, Vol. 7, No. 3, 1612-1639"

proportion to their taxable income and without any limit on the maximum of

period 1862-1909. We use a novel identification strategy where we combine two
different identification strategies, i.e., a threshold regression analysis and
a generalized event-study design, both of which exploit nonlinearities or
discontinuities in the effect of political power between two opposing local
elites: agricultural landowners and emerging industrialists. The results
suggest that school spending is approximately 90-120% higher if the nonagrarian
interest controls all of the votes compared to when landowners have more than a

1590,"More style, less work: card-style data decrease risk-limiting audit sample sizes","U.S. elections rely heavily on computers such as voter registration
databases, electronic pollbooks, voting machines, scanners, tabulators, and
results reporting websites. These introduce digital threats to election
outcomes. Risk-limiting audits (RLAs) mitigate threats to some of these systems
by manually inspecting random samples of ballot cards. RLAs have a large chance
of correcting wrong outcomes (by conducting a full manual tabulation of a
trustworthy record of the votes), but can save labor when reported outcomes are
correct. This efficiency is eroded when sampling cannot be targeted to ballot
cards that contain the contest(s) under audit. If the sample is drawn from all
cast cards, RLA sample sizes scale like the reciprocal of the fraction of
ballot cards that contain the contest(s) under audit. That fraction shrinks as
the number of cards per ballot grows (i.e., when elections contain more
contests) and as the fraction of ballots that contain the contest decreases
(i.e., when a smaller percentage of voters are eligible to vote in the
contest). States that conduct RLAs of contests on multi-card ballots or of
small contests can dramatically reduce sample sizes by using information about
which ballot cards contain which contests -- by keeping track of card-style
data (CSD). For instance, CSD reduces the expected number of draws needed to
audit a single countywide contest on a 4-card ballot by 75%. Similarly, CSD
reduces the expected number of draws by 95% or more for an audit of two
contests with the same margin on a 4-card ballot if one contest is on every
ballot and the other is on 10% of ballots. In realistic examples, the savings
can be several orders of magnitude.",2012.03371v1,cs.CR,2020-12-06 20:35:12+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Amanda K. Glazer'), arxiv.Result.Author('Jacob V. Spertus'), arxiv.Result.Author('Philip B. Stark')]",

1592,(Universal) Unconditional Verifiability in E-Voting without Trusted Parties,"In traditional e-voting protocols, privacy is often provided by a trusted
authority that learns the votes and computes the tally. Some protocols replace
the trusted authority by a set of authorities, and privacy is guaranteed if
less than a threshold number of authorities are corrupt. For verifiability,
stronger security guarantees are demanded. Typically, corrupt authorities that
try to fake the result of the tally must always be detected.
  To provide verifiability, many e-voting protocols use Non-Interactive
Zero-Knowledge proofs (NIZKs). Thanks to their non-interactive nature, NIZKs
allow anybody, including third parties that do not participate in the protocol,
to verify the correctness of the tally. Therefore, NIZKs can be used to obtain
universal verifiability. Additionally, NIZKs also improve usability because
they allow voters to cast a vote using a non-interactive protocol.
  The disadvantage of NIZKs is that their security is based on setup
assumptions such as the common reference string (CRS) or the random oracle (RO)
model. The former requires a trusted party for the generation of a common
reference string. The latter, though a popular methodology for designing secure
protocols, has been shown to be unsound.
  In this paper, we address the design of an e-voting protocol that provides
verifiability without any trust assumptions, where verifiability here is meant
without eligibility verification. We show that Non-Interactive
Witness-Indistinguishable proofs (NIWI) can be used for this purpose. The
e-voting scheme is private under the Decision Linear assumption, while
verifiability holds unconditionally. To our knowledge, this is the first
private e-voting scheme with perfect universal verifiability, i.e. one in which
the probability of a fake tally not being detected is 0, and with {\em
non-interactive} protocols that does not rely on trust assumptions.",1610.06343v1,cs.CR,2016-10-20 09:57:12+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Gina Gallegos-Garcia'), arxiv.Result.Author('Vincenzo Iovino'), arxiv.Result.Author('Alfredo Rial'), arxiv.Result.Author('Peter B.

and candidate choice. While contemporary work on the distribution of political
opinion has emphasized polarization and an increasing gap between the ""left""
and the ""right"" in democracies, the median voter theorem presents a model of
anti-polarization: competing candidates move to the center of the ideological
distribution to maximize vote share, regardless of the underlying ideological
distribution of voters. These anti-polar results, however, largely depend on
the ""singled-peakedness"" of voter preferences, an assumption that is rapidly
loosing relevance in the age of polarization. This article presents a model of
voter choice that examines three potential mechanisms that can undermine this
finding: a relative cost of voting that deters voters who are sufficiently
indifferent to both candidates, ideologically motivated third-party
alternatives that attract extreme voters, and a bimodal distribution of voter
ideology. Under reasonable sets of conditions and empirically observed voter
opinion distributions, these mechanisms can be sufficient to cause
strategically-minded candidates to fail to converge to the center, or to even
become more polarized than their electorate.",2103.12847v1,physics.soc-ph,2021-03-23 21:14:22+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Matthew I. Jones'), arxiv.Result.Author('Antonio D. Sirianni'), arxiv.Result.Author('Feng Fu')]",
1594,A Fault Tolerance Improved Majority Voter for TMR System Architectures,"For digital system designs, triple modular redundancy (TMR), which is a
3-tuple version of N-modular redundancy is widely preferred for many
mission-control and safety-critical applications. The TMR scheme involves
two-times duplication of the simplex system hardware, with a majority voter
ensuring correctness provided at least two out of three copies of the system
remain operational. Thus the majority voter plays a pivotal role in ensuring
the correct operation of the system. The fundamental assumption implicit in the
TMR scheme is that the majority voter does not become faulty, which may not
hold well for implementations based on latest technology nodes with dimensions
of the order of just tens of nanometers. To overcome the drawbacks of the
classical majority voter some new voter designs were put forward in the
literature with the aim of enhancing the fault tolerance. However, these voter
designs generally ensure the correct system operation in the presence of either
a faulty function module or the faulty voter, considered only in isolation.
Since multiple faults may no longer be excluded in the nanoelectronics regime,
simultaneous fault occurrences on both the function module and the voter should
be considered, and the fault tolerance of the voters have to be analyzed under
such a scenario. In this context, this article proposes a new fault-tolerant
majority voter which is found to be more robust to faults than the existing
voters in the presence of faults occurring internally and/or externally to the
voter. Moreover, the proposed voter features less power dissipation, delay, and

1595,On the Computational Complexity of Variants of Combinatorial Voter Control in Elections,"Voter control problems model situations in which an external agent tries
toaffect the result of an election by adding or deleting the fewest number of
voters. The goal of the agent is to make a specific candidate either win
(\emph{constructive} control) or lose (\emph{destructive} control) the
election. We study the constructive and destructive voter control problems
whenadding and deleting voters have a \emph{combinatorial flavor}: If we add
(resp.\ delete) a voter~$v$, we also add (resp.\ delete) a bundle~$\kappa(v) $
of voters that are associated with~$v$. While the bundle~$\kappa(v)$ may have
more than one voter, a voter may also be associated with more than one voter.
We analyze the computational complexity of the four voter control problems for
the Plurality rule. We obtain that, in general, making a candidate lose is
computationally easier than making her win. In particular, if the bundling
relation is symmetric (i.e.\ $\forall w\colon w \in \kappa(v) \Leftrightarrow v
\in \kappa(w) $), and if each voter has at most two voters associated with him,
then destructive control is polynomial-time solvable while the constructive
variant remains $\NP$-hard. Even if the bundles are disjoint (i.e.\ $\forall
w\colon w \in \kappa(v) \Leftrightarrow \kappa(v) = \kappa(w) $), the
constructive problem variants remain intractable. Finally, the minimization
variant of constructive control by adding voters does not admit an efficient
approximation algorithm, unless P=NP.",1701.05108v1,cs.MA,2017-01-18 15:36:46+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Leon Kellerhals'), arxiv.Result.Author('Viatcheslav Korenwein'), arxiv.Result.Author('Philipp Zschoche'), arxiv.Result.Author('Robert Bredereck'), arxiv.Result.Author('Jiehua Chen')]",

external factors. Finally, we use a ranking scheme on these predictions to
identify two key types of voter: 1) Voters who are likely to vote that we can
convince to vote for a given party; and, 2) Voters who are likely to vote for a
given party, if they vote, that we can convince to actually turn out to vote.

potentially hard to solve, have a quantum solution which can be verified
efficiently using a quantum computer. It thus forms a natural quantum version
of the classical complexity class NP (and its probabilistic variant MA,
Merlin-Arthur games), where the verifier has only classical computational
resources. In this paper, we study what happens when we restrict the quantum
resources of the verifier to the bare minimum: individual measurements on
single qubits received as they come, one-by-one. We find that despite this
grave restriction, it is still possible to soundly verify any problem in QMA
for the verifier with the minimum quantum resources possible, without using any
quantum memory or multiqubit operations. We provide two independent proofs of
this fact, based on measurement based quantum computation and the local
Hamiltonian problem, respectively. The former construction also applies to

1607,Distributed Verifiers in PCP,"Traditional proof systems involve a resource-bounded verifier communicating
with a powerful (but untrusted) prover. Distributed verifier proof systems are
a new family of proof models that involve a network of verifier nodes
communicating with a single independent prover that has access to the complete
network structure of the verifiers. The prover is tasked with convincing all
verifiers of some global property of the network graph. In addition, each
individual verifier may be given some input string they will be required to
verify during the course of computation. Verifier nodes are allowed to exchange
messaged with nodes a constant distance away, and accept / reject the input
after some computation.
  Because individual nodes are limited to a local view, communication with the
prover is potentially necessary to prove global properties about the network
graph of nodes, which only the prover has access to. In this system of models,
the entire model accepts the input if and only if every individual node has
accepted.
  There are three models in the distributed verifier proof system family:
$\mathsf{LCP}$, $\mathsf{dIP}$, and our proposed $\mathsf{dPCP}$, with the
fundamental difference between these coming from the type of communication
established between the verifiers and the prover. In this paper, we will first
go over the past work in the $\mathsf{LCP}$ and $\mathsf{dIP}$ space before
showing properties and proofs in our $\mathsf{dPCP}$ system.",2005.10749v1,cs.CC,2020-05-21 16:01:09+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Nagaganesh Jaladanki'), arxiv.Result.Author('Wilson Wu')]",

however, verifying that the developed components all behave as they should
individually and as a whole presents its own unique set of challenges. In
particular, distinct components in a modular robotic system often require
different verification techniques to ensure that they behave as expected.
Ensuring whole system consistency when individual components are verified using
a variety of techniques and formalisms is difficult. This paper discusses how
to use compositional verification to integrate the various verification
techniques that are applied to modular robotic software, using a First-Order
Logic (FOL) contract that captures each component's assumptions and guarantees.
These contracts can then be used to guide the verification of the individual
components, be it by testing or the use of a formal method. We provide an
illustrative example of an autonomous robot used in remote inspection. We also

to train neural networks that are verifiable, i.e., networks that provably
satisfy some desired input-output properties. The key idea is to simultaneously
train two networks: a predictor network that performs the task at hand,e.g.,
predicting labels given inputs, and a verifier network that computes a bound on
how well the predictor satisfies the properties being verified. Both networks
can be trained simultaneously to optimize a weighted combination of the
standard data-fitting loss and a term that bounds the maximum violation of the
property. Experiments show that not only is the predictor-verifier architecture
able to train networks to achieve state of the art verified robustness to
adversarial examples with much shorter training times (outperforming previous
algorithms on small datasets like MNIST and SVHN), but it can also be scaled to
produce the first known (to the best of our knowledge) verifiably robust

1610,(Universal) Unconditional Verifiability in E-Voting without Trusted Parties,"In traditional e-voting protocols, privacy is often provided by a trusted
authority that learns the votes and computes the tally. Some protocols replace
the trusted authority by a set of authorities, and privacy is guaranteed if
less than a threshold number of authorities are corrupt. For verifiability,
stronger security guarantees are demanded. Typically, corrupt authorities that
try to fake the result of the tally must always be detected.
  To provide verifiability, many e-voting protocols use Non-Interactive
Zero-Knowledge proofs (NIZKs). Thanks to their non-interactive nature, NIZKs
allow anybody, including third parties that do not participate in the protocol,
to verify the correctness of the tally. Therefore, NIZKs can be used to obtain
universal verifiability. Additionally, NIZKs also improve usability because
they allow voters to cast a vote using a non-interactive protocol.
  The disadvantage of NIZKs is that their security is based on setup
assumptions such as the common reference string (CRS) or the random oracle (RO)
model. The former requires a trusted party for the generation of a common
reference string. The latter, though a popular methodology for designing secure
protocols, has been shown to be unsound.
  In this paper, we address the design of an e-voting protocol that provides
verifiability without any trust assumptions, where verifiability here is meant
without eligibility verification. We show that Non-Interactive
Witness-Indistinguishable proofs (NIWI) can be used for this purpose. The
e-voting scheme is private under the Decision Linear assumption, while
verifiability holds unconditionally. To our knowledge, this is the first
private e-voting scheme with perfect universal verifiability, i.e. one in which
the probability of a fake tally not being detected is 0, and with {\em
non-interactive} protocols that does not rely on trust assumptions.",1610.06343v1,cs.CR,2016-10-20 09:57:12+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Gina Gallegos-Garcia'), arxiv.Result.Author('Vincenzo Iovino'), arxiv.Result.Author('Alfredo Rial'), arxiv.Result.Author('Peter B.

modulo summation. Secure modulo summation is a calculation of modulo summation
$Y_1+\ldots+ Y_m$ when $m$ players have their individual variables $Y_1,\ldots,
Y_m$ with keeping the secrecy of the individual variables. However, the
conventional method for secure modulo summation uses so many secret
communication channels. We say that a quantum protocol for secure modulo
summation is quantum verifiable secure modulo summation when it can verify the
desired secrecy condition. If we combine device independent quantum key
distribution, it is possible to verify such secret communication channels.
However, it consumes so many steps. To resolve this problem, using quantum
systems, we propose a more direct method to realize secure modulo summation
with verification. To realize this protocol, we propose modulo zero-sum
randomness as another new concept, and show that secure modulo summation can be
realized by using modulo zero-sum randomness. Then, we construct a verifiable
quantum protocol method to generate modulo zero-sum randomness. This protocol
can be verified only with minimum requirements.",1910.05976v1,quant-ph,2019-10-14 08:20:03+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Masahito Hayashi'), arxiv.Result.Author('Takeshi Koshiba')]",

quantum computing: the honest prover sends a graph state to the verifier, and
the verifier can perform universal quantum computing on it with only
single-qubit measurements. If the prover is malicious, he does not necessarily
generate the correct graph state, but the verifier can verify the correctness
of the graph state by measuring the stabilizer operators.",1607.00574v1,quant-ph,2016-07-03 01:18:09+00:00,[arxiv.Result.Author('Tomoyuki Morimae')],
1614,Increasing the power of the verifier in Quantum Zero Knowledge,"In quantum zero knowledge, the assumption was made that the verifier is only
using unitary operations. Under this assumption, many nice properties have been
shown about quantum zero knowledge, including the fact that Honest-Verifier
Quantum Statistical Zero Knowledge (HVQSZK) is equal to Cheating-Verifier
Quantum Statistical Zero Knowledge (QSZK) (see [Wat02,Wat06]).
  In this paper, we study what happens when we allow an honest verifier to flip
some coins in addition to using unitary operations. Flipping a coin is a
non-unitary operation but doesn't seem at first to enhance the cheating
possibilities of the verifier since a classical honest verifier can flip coins.
In this setting, we show an unexpected result: any classical Interactive Proof
has an Honest-Verifier Quantum Statistical Zero Knowledge proof with coins.
Note that in the classical case, honest verifier SZK is no more powerful than
SZK and hence it is not believed to contain even NP. On the other hand, in the
case of cheating verifiers, we show that Quantum Statistical Zero Knowledge
where the verifier applies any non-unitary operation is equal to Quantum
Zero-Knowledge where the verifier uses only unitaries.
  One can think of our results in two complementary ways. If we would like to
use the honest verifier model as a means to study the general model by taking
advantage of their equivalence, then it is imperative to use the unitary
definition without coins, since with the general one this equivalence is most
probably not true. On the other hand, if we would like to use quantum zero
knowledge protocols in a cryptographic scenario where the honest-but-curious
model is sufficient, then adding the unitary constraint severely decreases the
power of quantum zero knowledge protocols.",0711.4032v3,quant-ph,2007-11-26 15:37:25+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('André Chailloux'), arxiv.Result.Author('Iordanis Kerenidis')]",

correspond to diagrams. Edges in these diagrams join occurrences of variables
that must remain the same in every generalization of the proof. It is found
that assumptions about equality of proofs for equality are parallel to standard

models subsumes the entire analytical hierarchy. This holds already for the
most simple infinite objects, viz. streams over {0,1}, and stands in sharp

effect of the equality on permutation-based time irreversibility are
investigated in this paper. We measure the distributions of equal heartbeat
intervals under three conditions, namely congestive heart failure (CHF),
healthy young and elderly, whose time irreversibility of heartbeats is detected
by measuring the probabilistic difference between permutations instead of raw
vectors. We demonstrate that heartbeats contain high rates of equal states,
particularly the CHF with around 20% equalities, and the distributions of equal
values discriminate the heartbeats at very short data length. The CHF have more
equal values than the healthy young (p<1.47*10^{-15}) and elderly
(p<2.48*10^{-11}), and the healthy young have less equalities than the elderly
(p<3.16*10^{-4}). Time irreversibility considering equal values is promising to
extract nonlinear behaviors of heartbeats, confirming the decreased nonlinear
complexity of the diseased and aging heart rates, while that involving no
equality leads to erroneous nonlinearity detection. In our contribution, we
highlight the pathological or physiological information contained by the
distribution of equal heartbeat intervals that might contribute to develop

1639,A Posteriori Equivalence: A New Perspective for Design of Optimal Channel Shortening Equalizers,"The problem of channel shortening equalization for optimal detection in ISI
channels is considered. The problem is to choose a linear equalizer and a
partial response target filter such that the combination produces the best
detection performance. Instead of using the traditional approach of MMSE
equalization, we directly seek all equalizer and target pairs that yield
optimal detection performance in terms of the sequence or symbol error rate.
This leads to a new notion of a posteriori equivalence between the equalized
and target channels with a simple characterization in terms of their underlying
probability distributions. Using this characterization we show the surprising
existence an infinite family of equalizer and target pairs for which any
maximum a posteriori (MAP) based detector designed for the target channel is
simultaneously MAP optimal for the equalized channel. For channels whose input
symbols have equal energy, such as q-PSK, the MMSE equalizer designed with a
monic target constraint yields a solution belonging to this optimal family of
designs. Although, these designs produce IIR target filters, the ideas are
extended to design good FIR targets. For an arbitrary choice of target and
equalizer, we derive an expression for the probability of sequence detection
error. This expression is used to design optimal FIR targets and IIR equalizers
and to quantify the FIR approximation penalty.",0710.3802v1,cs.IT,2007-10-19 23:22:23+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Raman Venkataramani'), arxiv.Result.Author('M. Fatih Erden')]",

1642,Limiting Risk by Turning Manifest Phantoms into Evil Zombies,"Drawing a random sample of ballots to conduct a risk-limiting audit generally
requires knowing how the ballots cast in an election are organized into groups,
for instance, how many containers of ballots there are in all and how many
ballots are in each container. A list of the ballot group identifiers along
with number of ballots in each group is called a ballot manifest. What if the
ballot manifest is not accurate? Surprisingly, even if ballots are known to be
missing from the manifest, it is not necessary to make worst-case assumptions
about those ballots--for instance, to adjust the margin by the number of
missing ballots--to ensure that the audit remains conservative. Rather, it
suffices to make worst-case assumptions about the individual randomly selected
ballots that the audit cannot find. This observation provides a simple
modification to some risk-limiting audit procedures that makes them
automatically become more conservative if the ballot manifest has errors. The
modification--phantoms to evil zombies (~2EZ)--requires only an upper bound on
the total number of ballots cast. ~2EZ makes the audit P-value stochastically
larger than it would be had the manifest been accurate, automatically requiring
more than enough ballots to be audited to offset the manifest errors. This
ensures that the true risk limit remains smaller than the nominal risk limit.
On the other hand, if the manifest is in fact accurate and the upper bound on
the total number of ballots equals the total according to the manifest, ~2EZ
has no effect at all on the number of ballots audited nor on the true risk
limit.",1207.3413v1,stat.AP,2012-07-14 11:26:02+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Jorge H. Banuelos'), arxiv.Result.Author('Philip B. Stark')]",

In this study, we altered votes on a voter's ballot after they had made their
selections on a BMD. We then required them to examine their ballots for any
changes from the slate they used to vote. Overall accuracy was exceptionally
high. Participants saw 1440 total contests, and of those 1440, there were a
total of 4 errors, so total accuracy was 99.8%. Participants were able to
perform with near-perfect accuracy regardless of ballot length, ballot type,
number of altered races, and location of altered races. Detection performance
was extremely robust. We conclude that with proper direction and resources,
voters can be near-perfect detectors of ballot changes on printed paper ballots
after voting with a BMD. This finding has significant implications for the
voting community as BMD use continues to grow. Research should now focus on
identifying administrative and behavioral methods that will prompt and

malevolent adversary trying to buy real ballots. If the citizenry is divided
into subgroups (or districts), the adversary can construct a so-called ""Devil's
Menu"" consisting of several prices. In equilibrium, the adversary can buy the
real ballots of any strict subset of districts at a price corresponding to the
willingness to sell on the part of the citizens holding such ballots. By
contrast, decoy voters are trapped into selling their ballots at a low, or even
negligible, price. Blowing up the adversary's budget by introducing decoy
ballots may thus turn out to be futile. The Devil's Menu can also be applied to
the well-known ""Lemons Problem"".",1712.05477v1,cs.GT,2017-12-14 23:54:58+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Hans Gersbach'), arxiv.Result.Author('Akaki Mamageishvili'), arxiv.Result.Author('Oriol Tejada')]",
1647,MicroCash: Practical Concurrent Processing of Micropayments,"Micropayments are increasingly being adopted by a large number of
applications. However, processing micropayments individually can be expensive,
with transaction fees exceeding the payment value itself. By aggregating these
small transactions into a few larger ones, and using cryptocurrencies, today's
decentralized probabilistic micropayment schemes can reduce these fees.
Unfortunately, existing solutions force micropayments to be issued
sequentially, thus to support fast issuance rates a customer needs to create a
large number of escrows, which bloats the blockchain. Moreover, these schemes
incur a large computation and bandwidth overhead, which limit their
applicability in large-scale systems.
  In this paper, we propose MicroCash, the first decentralized probabilistic
framework that supports concurrent micropayments. MicroCash introduces a novel
escrow setup that enables a customer to concurrently issue payment tickets at a
fast rate using a single escrow. MicroCash is also cost effective because it
allows for ticket exchange using only one round of communication, and it
aggregates the micropayments using a lottery protocol that requires only secure
hashing. Our experiments show that MicroCash can process thousands of tickets
per second, which is around 1.7-4.2x times the rate of a state-of-the-art
sequential micropayment system. Moreover, MicroCash supports any ticket issue
rate over any period using only one escrow, while the sequential scheme would
need more than 1000 escrows per second to permit high rates. This enables our
system to further reduce transaction fees and data on the blockchain by around
50%.",1911.08520v1,cs.CR,2019-11-19 19:29:31+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Ghada Almashaqbeh'), arxiv.Result.Author('Allison Bishop'), arxiv.Result.Author('Justin Cappos')]",
1648,The ATHENA Class of Risk-Limiting Ballot Polling Audits,"The main risk-limiting ballot polling audit in use today, BRAVO, is designed
for use when single ballots are drawn at random and a decision regarding
whether to stop the audit or draw another ballot is taken after each ballot
draw (ballot-by-ballot (B2) audits). On the other hand, real ballot polling
audits draw many ballots in a single round before determining whether to stop
(round-by-round (R2) audits). We show that BRAVO results in significant
inefficiency when directly applied to real R2 audits. We present the ATHENA
class of R2 stopping rules, which we show are risk-limiting if the round
schedule is pre-determined (before the audit begins). We prove that each rule
is at least as efficient as the corresponding BRAVO stopping rule applied at
the end of the round. We have open-source software libraries implementing most
of our results.
  We show that ATHENA halves the number of ballots required, for all state
margins in the 2016 US Presidential election and a first round with $90\%$
stopping probability, when compared to BRAVO (stopping rule applied at the end
of the round). We present simulation results supporting the 90% stopping
probability claims and our claims for the risk accrued in the first round.
Further, ATHENA reduces the number of ballots by more than a quarter for low
margins, when compared to the BRAVO stopping rule applied on ballots in
selection order. This implies that keeping track of the order when drawing
ballots R2 is not beneficial, because ATHENA is more efficient even without
information on selection order. These results are significant because current
approaches to real ballot polling election audits use the B2 BRAVO rules,
requiring about twice as much work on the part of election officials. Applying
the rules in selection order requires fewer ballots, but keeping track of the
order, and entering it into audit software, adds to the effort.",2008.02315v5,cs.CR,2020-08-05 18:47:37+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Filip Zagórski'), arxiv.Result.Author('Grant McClearn'), arxiv.Result.Author('Sarah Morin'), arxiv.Result.Author('Neal McBurnett'), arxiv.Result.Author('Poorvi L.

Our method involves doing $k$ ""cuts"", each involving moving a random portion of
ballots from the top to the bottom of the stack, and then picking the ballot on
top. Unlike conventional methods of picking a ballot at random, $k$-cut does
not require identification numbers on the ballots or counting many ballots per
draw. We analyze how close the distribution of chosen ballots is to the uniform
distribution, and design different mitigation procedures. We show that $k=6$

sample from the whole population of cast ballots or requiring stratified
sampling; (3) it can start in polling places on election night, before margins
are known. If the reported margins for the 2016 U.S. Presidential election are
correct, a Bernoulli ballot-polling audit with a risk limit of 5% and a
sampling rate of $p_0 = 1\%$ would have had at least a 99% probability of

justifiably high confidence that the reported results of an election are

SOBA combines three ideas: (1) publishing cast vote records (CVRs) separately
for each contest, so that anyone can verify that each reported contest outcome
is correct, if the CVRs reflect voters' intentions with sufficient accuracy;
(2) shrouding a mapping between ballots and the CVRs for those ballots to
prevent the loss of privacy that could occur otherwise; (3) assessing the
accuracy with which the CVRs reflect voters' intentions for a collection of
contests while simultaneously assessing the integrity of the shrouded mapping
between ballots and CVRs by comparing randomly selected ballots to the CVRs
that purport to represent them. Step (1) is related to work by the Humboldt
County Election Transparency Project, but publishing CVRs separately for
individual contests rather than images of entire ballots preserves privacy.
Step (2) requires a cryptographic commitment from elections officials.
Observers participate in step (3), which relies on the ""super-simple

relatively few ballots if the shrouded mapping is proper and the CVRs
accurately reflect voter intent. But if the reported outcomes of the contests

understand this problem, we conducted an experiment in which 108 participants
participated in a mock election where the BMD displayed the voters' true
choices, but then changed a subset of those choices on the printed ballot. The
design of the printed ballot, the length of the ballot, the number of changes
that were made to the ballot, the location of those changes, and the
instructions provided to the voters were manipulated as part of the experiment.
Results indicated that of those voters who chose to examine the printed ballot,

1654,Finding Safety in Numbers with Secure Allegation Escrows,"For fear of retribution, the victim of a crime may be willing to report it
only if other victims of the same perpetrator also step forward. Common
examples include 1) identifying oneself as the victim of sexual harassment,
especially by a person in a position of authority or 2) accusing an influential
politician, an authoritarian government, or ones own employer of corruption. To
handle such situations, legal literature has proposed the concept of an
allegation escrow: a neutral third-party that collects allegations anonymously,
matches them against each other, and de-anonymizes allegers only after
de-anonymity thresholds (in terms of number of co-allegers), pre-specified by
the allegers, are reached.
  An allegation escrow can be realized as a single trusted third party;
however, this party must be trusted to keep the identity of the alleger and
content of the allegation private. To address this problem, this paper
introduces Secure Allegation Escrows (SAE, pronounced ""say""). A SAE is a group
of parties with independent interests and motives, acting jointly as an escrow
for collecting allegations from individuals, matching the allegations, and
de-anonymizing the allegations when designated thresholds are reached. By
design, SAEs provide a very strong property: No less than a majority of parties
constituting a SAE can de-anonymize or disclose the content of an allegation
without a sufficient number of matching allegations (even in collusion with any
number of other allegers). Once a sufficient number of matching allegations
exist, the join escrow discloses the allegation with the allegers' identities.

versions. Discrepancies are referred to as errors, and are used to build
evidence against or in support of the recorded result. Risk-limiting audits for
first-past-the-post elections are well understood, and used in some US
elections. We define a number of approaches to ballot-polling and comparison
risk-limiting audits for Instant Runoff Voting (IRV) elections. We show that
for almost all real elections we found, we can perform a risk-limiting audit by
looking at only a small fraction of the total ballots (assuming no errors were

ballot permutation. In this paper, we present a decomposition of ballot
permutations that enables us to construct a bijection between ballot
permutations and odd order permutations, which proves a set-valued extension of
a conjecture due to Spiro using the statistic of peak values. This bijection
also preserves the neighbors of the largest letter in permutations and thus
resolves a refinement of Spiro' s conjecture proposed by Wang and Zhang. Our
decomposition can be extended to well-labelled positive paths, a class of
generalized ballot permutations arising from polytope theory, that were
enumerated by Bernardi, Duplantier and Nadeau. We will also investigate the

1658,Ballot Length in Instant Runoff Voting,"Instant runoff voting (IRV) is an increasingly-popular alternative to
traditional plurality voting in which voters submit rankings over the
candidates rather than single votes. In practice, elections using IRV often
restrict the ballot length, the number of candidates a voter is allowed to rank
on their ballot. We theoretically and empirically analyze how ballot length can
influence the outcome of an election, given fixed voter preferences. We show
that there exist preference profiles over $k$ candidates such that up to $k-1$
different candidates win at different ballot lengths. We derive exact lower
bounds on the number of voters required for such profiles and provide a
construction matching the lower bound for unrestricted voter preferences.
Additionally, we characterize which sequences of winners are possible over
ballot lengths and provide explicit profile constructions achieving any
feasible winner sequence. We also examine how classic preference restrictions
influence our results--for instance, single-peakedness makes $k-1$ different
winners impossible but still allows at least $\Omega(\sqrt k)$. Finally, we
analyze a collection of 168 real-world elections, where we truncate rankings to
simulate shorter ballots. We find that shorter ballots could have changed the
outcome in one quarter of these elections. Our results highlight ballot length
as a consequential degree of freedom in the design of IRV elections.",2207.08958v3,cs.MA,2022-07-18 22:01:13+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Kiran Tomlinson'), arxiv.Result.Author('Johan Ugander'), arxiv.Result.Author('Jon Kleinberg')]",

a third party where the buyer locks the money until they receive the goods they
want from the seller. A simplified escrow system can be modeled as a certain
kind of _optic_ in a monoidal category $\mathcal M$ (e.g., the category of sets
with cartesian product); escrows can be regarded as morphisms of a category
$\mathcal E(\mathcal M)$, with the same objects of $\mathcal M$, and where the
hom-objects are $\langle X , Y \rangle = \mathsf{Opt}_{\mathcal M}(\left[

there is uncertainty about how others will vote. In this paper, we study
strategic voting when there is uncertainty about the voting method. We
introduce three notions of manipulability for a set of voting methods: sure,
safe, and expected manipulability. With the help of a computer program, we
identify voting scenarios in which uncertainty about the voting method may
reduce or even eliminate a voter's incentive to misrepresent her preferences.
Thus, it may be in the interest of an election designer who wishes to reduce
strategic voting to leave voters uncertain about which of several reasonable
voting methods will be used to determine the winners of an election.",1907.09110v1,cs.MA,2019-07-22 03:17:19+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Wesley H. Holliday'), arxiv.Result.Author('Eric Pacuit')]","EPTCS 297, 2019, pp. 252-272"

interference by third parties. For example, suppose votes have been cast in an
election between two candidates, and then each vote is randomly changed with a

the outcome of the election the same, regardless of the changes to the votes.
It is well known that the US electoral college system is about 5 times more
likely to have a changed outcome due to vote corruption, when compared to a
majority vote. In fact, Mossel, O'Donnell and Oleszkiewicz proved in 2005 that
the majority voting method is most stable to this random vote corruption, among
voting methods where each person has a small influence on the election. We
discuss some recent progress on the analogous result for elections between more
than two candidates. In this case, plurality should be most stable to
corruption in votes. We also survey results on adversarial election
manipulation (where an adversary can select particular votes to change, perhaps
in a non-random way), and we briefly discuss ranked choice voting methods

1673,Heuristics in Multi-Winner Approval Voting,"In many real world situations, collective decisions are made using voting.
Moreover, scenarios such as committee or board elections require voting rules
that return multiple winners. In multi-winner approval voting (AV), an agent
may vote for as many candidates as they wish. Winners are chosen by tallying up
the votes and choosing the top-$k$ candidates receiving the most votes. An
agent may manipulate the vote to achieve a better outcome by voting in a way
that does not reflect their true preferences. In complex and uncertain
situations, agents may use heuristics to strategize, instead of incurring the
additional effort required to compute the manipulation which most favors them.
In this paper, we examine voting behavior in multi-winner approval voting
scenarios with complete information. We show that people generally manipulate
their vote to obtain a better outcome, but often do not identify the optimal
manipulation. Instead, voters tend to prioritize the candidates with the
highest utilities. Using simulations, we demonstrate the effectiveness of these
heuristics in situations where agents only have access to partial information.",1905.12104v2,cs.GT,2019-05-28 21:44:07+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Jaelle Scheuerman'), arxiv.Result.Author('Jason L. Harman'), arxiv.Result.Author('Nicholas Mattei'), arxiv.Result.Author('K. Brent Venable')]",
1674,Bucklin Voting is Broadly Resistant to Control,"Electoral control models ways of changing the outcome of an election via such

actions modify an election's participation structure and aim at either making a
favorite candidate win (""constructive control"") or prevent a despised candidate
from winning (""destructive control""), which yields a total of 22 standard
control scenarios. To protect elections from such control attempts,
computational complexity has been used to show that electoral control, though
not impossible, is computationally prohibitive. Among natural voting systems
with a polynomial-time winner problem, the two systems with the highest number
of proven resistances to control types (namely 19 out of 22) are
""sincere-strategy preference-based approval voting"" (SP-AV, a modification of a
system proposed by Brams and Sanver) and fallback voting. Both are hybrid
systems; e.g., fallback voting combines approval with Bucklin voting. In this
paper, we study the control complexity of Bucklin voting itself and show that
it behaves equally well in terms of control resistance for the 20 cases
investigated so far. As Bucklin voting is a special case of fallback voting,

analyser (MA) VABAMORF , thus performing a soft morphological disambiguation.
We compare two ways of supplementing a neural morphological tagger with the MA
outputs: firstly, by adding the combined analyses embeddings to the word
representation input to the neural tagging model, and secondly, by adopting an
attention mechanism to focus on the most relevant analyses generated by the MA.
Experiments on three Estonian datasets show that our neural architectures
consistently outperform the non-neural baselines, including HMM-disambiguated
VABAMORF, while augmenting models with MA outputs results in a further
performance boost for both models.",1810.06908v1,cs.CL,2018-10-16 10:00:06+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Alexander Tkachenko'), arxiv.Result.Author('Kairit Sirts')]",Proceedings of the Eighth International Conference Baltic HLT 2018

1715,The Case for a Legal Compliance API for the Enforcement of the EU's Digital Services Act on Social Media Platforms,"In the course of under a year, the European Commission has launched some of
the most important regulatory proposals to date on platform governance. The
Commission's goals behind cross-sectoral regulation of this sort include the
protection of markets and democracies alike. While all these acts propose
sophisticated rules for setting up new enforcement institutions and procedures,
one aspect remains highly unclear: how digital enforcement will actually take
place in practice. Focusing on the Digital Services Act (DSA), this discussion
paper critically addresses issues around social media data access for the
purpose of digital enforcement and proposes the use of a legal compliance
application programming interface (API) as a means to facilitate compliance
with the DSA and complementary European and national regulation. To
contextualize this discussion, the paper pursues two scenarios that exemplify
the harms arising out of content monetization affecting a particularly
vulnerable category of social media users: children. The two scenarios are used
to further reflect upon essential issues surrounding data access and legal
compliance with the DSA and further applicable legal standards in the field of
labour and consumer law.",2205.06666v1,cs.CY,2022-05-13 14:16:23+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Catalina Goanta'), arxiv.Result.Author('Thales Bertaglia'), arxiv.Result.Author('Adriana Iamnitchi')]",
1716,Power-to-X in Energy Hubs: Operations and Policies Supporting the Scale-Up of Renewable Fuel Production,"Power-to-X (P2X) needs to scale up rapidly to provide the fuels required in
the hard-to-decarbonize industrial and heavy transport sector. Only recently,
the European Commission proposed requirements for \textit{renewable} fuels. P2X
energy hubs enable efficient synergies between energy infrastructures,
production facilities, and storage options. In this study, we explore the
optimal operation of an energy hub by leveraging the flexibility of P2X
including hydrogen, methanol, and ammonia synthesizers, and analyze potential
revenue streams such as the day-ahead and ancillary service markets. We propose
EnerHub2X, a mixed-integer linear program that maximizes the hub's profit based
on current market prices, considering technical constraints of P2X such as unit
commitment and non-linear efficiencies. We model a representative Danish energy
hub and find that without price incentives, it mainly produces liquid hydrogen
and sells renewable electricity. Only by adding a price premium of about 50\%
(0.16 \euro{}/kg) to the conventional fuel prices, sufficient amounts of
renewable ammonia and methanol are produced. To utilize production efficiently,
on-site renewable capacity and P2X must be carefully aligned. We show that
renewable power purchase agreements can provide flexibility while complying
with the rules set by the European Commission.",2209.01784v1,physics.soc-ph,2022-09-05 06:41:06+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Ioannis Kountouris'), arxiv.Result.Author('Lissy Langer'), arxiv.Result.Author('Rasmus Bramstoft'), arxiv.Result.Author('Marie Münster'), arxiv.Result.Author('Dogan Keles')]",

1722,Allocation of seats in the European Parliament and a degressive proportionality,"Distribution of seats in The European Parliament postulated by Treaty of
Lisbon should be degressively proportional. The meaning of degressively
proportional concept can be found in two principles annexed to the draft of
European Parliament resolution. The first, referred as the principle of fair
division, states that ""the larger the population of a Member State, the greater
is entitlement to a large number of seats"". The other condition, referred to as
the principle of relative proportionality, holds that ""the larger the
population of a country, the more inhabitants are represented by each of its
Members of the EU"". We postulate a clear and fair method which determines
uniquely a distribution of seats in the European Parliament which fulfil the
requirements of degressive proportionality. More generally, let $l_i$ be any
non-increasing sequence of real positive numbers. We say that a sequence of
natural numbers $m_{i}$ is degressively proportional with respect to the
sequence $l_{i}$, if $m_{i}$ and $l_{i}/m_{i}$ are non-increasing sequences.
Our method can be instrumental in uniquely determining a degressively
proportional sequence $m_{i}$ with respect to $l_{i}$ which fulfils given

the Eighth European Parliament (2014--2019) by analyzing two entirely different
aspects of the behavior of the Members of the European Parliament (MEPs) in the
policy-making processes. On one hand, we analyze their co-voting patterns and,
on the other, their retweeting behavior. We make use of two diverse datasets in
the analysis. The first one is the roll-call vote dataset, where cohesion is
regarded as the tendency to co-vote within a group, and a coalition is formed
when the members of several groups exhibit a high degree of co-voting agreement
on a subject. The second dataset comes from Twitter; it captures the retweeting
(i.e., endorsing) behavior of the MEPs and implies cohesion (retweets within
the same group) and coalitions (retweets between groups) from a completely
different perspective.
  We employ two different methodologies to analyze the cohesion and coalitions.
The first one is based on Krippendorff's Alpha reliability, used to measure the
agreement between raters in data-analysis scenarios, and the second one is
based on Exponential Random Graph Models, often used in social-network
analysis. We give general insights into the cohesion of political groups in the
European Parliament, explore whether coalitions are formed in the same way for
different policy areas, and examine to what degree the retweeting behavior of
MEPs corresponds to their co-voting patterns. A novel and interesting aspect of

algorithm recently proposed to identify balanced partitions in signed networks.

efficient method for scanning for resolutions in one such method. Additionally,
we introduce the notion of ""significance"" of a partition, based on subgraph
probabilities. Significance is independent of the exact method used, so could
also be applied in other methods, and can be interpreted as the gain in
encoding a graph by making use of a partition. Using significance, we can
determine ""good"" resolution parameters, which we demonstrate on benchmark
networks. Moreover, optimizing significance itself also shows excellent
performance. We demonstrate our method on voting data from the European
Parliament. Our analysis suggests the European Parliament has become

1733,Maximal modularity and the optimal size of parliaments,"An important question in representative democracies is how to determine the
optimal parliament size of a given country. According to an old conjecture,
known as the cubic root law, there is a fairly universal power-law relation,
with an exponent close to 1/3, between the size of an elected parliament and
the country's population. Empirical data in modern European countries support
such universality but are consistent with a larger exponent. In this work, we
analyze this intriguing regularity using tools from complex networks theory. We
model the population of a democratic country as a random network, drawn from a
growth model, where each node is assigned a constituency membership sampled
from an available set of size $D$. We calculate analytically the modularity of
the population and find that its functional relation with the number of
constituencies is strongly non-monotonic, exhibiting a maximum that depends on
the population size. The criterion of maximal modularity allows us to predict
that the number of representatives should scale as a power-law in the size of
the population, a finding that is qualitatively confirmed by the empirical
analysis of real-world data.",2012.12208v1,physics.soc-ph,2020-12-22 17:50:46+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Luca Gamberi'), arxiv.Result.Author('Yanik-Pascal Förster'), arxiv.Result.Author('Evan Tzanis'), arxiv.Result.Author('Alessia Annibale'), arxiv.Result.Author('Pierpaolo Vivo')]","Scientific Reports Rep 11, 14452 (2021)"

1745,Dynamics of economic unions: an agent-based model to investigate the economic and social drivers of withdrawals,"Economic unions are international agreements oriented to increase economic
efficiency and establishing political and cultural ties between the member
countries. Becoming a member of an existing union usually requires the approval
of both the candidate and members, while leaving it may require only the
unilateral will of the exiting country. There are many examples of accession of
states to previously consolidated economic unions, and a recent example of
leaving is the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union.
Motivated by the Brexit process, in this paper we propose an agent-based model
to study the determinant factors driving withdrawals from an economic union. We
show that both Union and local taxes promote the exits, whereas customs fees
out of the Union boost cohesion. Furthermore, heterogeneity in both business
conditions and wealth distribution promotes withdrawals, while countries' size
diversity does not have a significant effect on them. We also deep into the
individual causes that lead to dissatisfaction and, ultimately, to exits. We
found that, for low Union taxes, the wealth inequality within the country is
the leading cause of anti-Union opinion spreading. Conversely, for high Union
taxes, the country's performance turns out to be the main driving force,
resulting in a risk of wealthier countries leaving the Union. These findings
will be helpful for the design of economic policies and effective informative
campaigns.",2204.11553v1,physics.soc-ph,2022-04-25 11:01:26+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Carlos Gracia-Lázaro'), arxiv.Result.Author('Fabio Dercole'), arxiv.Result.Author('Yamir Moreno')]",

1763,Identifying Possible Winners in Ranked Choice Voting Elections with Outstanding Ballots,"Several election districts in the US have recently moved to ranked-choice

rank their choices, and the results are computed in rounds, eliminating one
candidate at a time. RCV ensures fairer elections and has been shown to
increase elected representation of women and people of color. A main drawback
of RCV is that the round-by-round process requires all the ballots to be
tallied before the results of an election can be calculated. With increasingly
large portions of ballots coming from absentee voters, RCV election outcomes
are not always apparent on election night, and can take several weeks to be
published, leading to a loss of trust in the electoral process from the public.
In this paper, we present an algorithm for efficiently computing possible
winners of RCV elections from partially known ballots and evaluate it on data
from the recent New York City Primary elections. We show that our techniques

1768,The Price of Political Uncertainty: Evidence from the 2016 U.S. Presidential Election and the U.S. Stock Markets,"There is bountiful evidence that political uncertainty stemming from
presidential elections or doubt about the direction of future policy make
financial markets significantly volatile, especially in proximity to close
elections or elections that may prompt radical policy changes. Although several
studies have examined the association between presidential elections and stock
returns, very little attention has been given to the impacts of elections and
election induced uncertainty on stock markets. This paper explores, at sectoral
level, the uncertain information hypothesis (UIH) as a means of explaining the
reaction of markets to the arrival of unanticipated information. This
hypothesis postulates that political uncertainty is greater prior to the
elections (relative to pre-election period) but is resolved once the outcome of
the elections is determined (relative to post-election period). To this end, we
adopt an event-study methodology that examines abnormal return behavior around
the election date. We show that collapsing stock returns around the election
result is reversed by positive abnormal return on the next day, except some
cases where we note negative responses following the vote count. Although
Trump's win plunges US into uncertain future, positive reactions of abnormal
return are found. Therefore, our results do not support the UIH hypothesis.
Besides, the effect of political uncertainty is sector-specific. While some
sectors emerged winners (healthcare, oil and gas, real estate, defense,
financials and consumer goods and services), others took the opposite route
(technology and utilities). The winning industries are generally those that
will benefit from the new administration's focus on rebuilding infrastructure,
renegotiating trade agreements, reforming tax policy and labour laws,
increasing defense funding, easing restrictions on energy production, and
rolling back Obamacare.",1612.06200v2,q-fin.GN,2016-12-19 14:28:59+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Jamal Bouoiyour'), arxiv.Result.Author('Refk Selmi')]",

1774,Sublinear Bounds for Randomized Leader Election,"This paper concerns {\em randomized} leader election in synchronous
distributed networks. A distributed leader election algorithm is presented for
complete $n$-node networks that runs in O(1) rounds and (with high probability)
uses only $O(\sqrt{n}\log^{3/2} n)$ messages to elect a unique leader (with
high probability). When considering the ""explicit"" variant of leader election
where eventually every node knows the identity of the leader, our algorithm
yields the asymptotically optimal bounds of O(1) rounds and O(n) messages. This
algorithm is then extended to one solving leader election on any connected
non-bipartite $n$-node graph $G$ in $O(\tau(G))$ time and
$O(\tau(G)\sqrt{n}\log^{3/2} n)$ messages, where $\tau(G)$ is the mixing time
of a random walk on $G$. The above result implies highly efficient (sublinear
running time and messages) leader election algorithms for networks with small
mixing times, such as expanders and hypercubes. In contrast, previous leader
election algorithms had at least linear message complexity even in complete
graphs. Moreover, super-linear message lower bounds are known for
time-efficient {\em deterministic} leader election algorithms.
  Finally, we present an almost matching lower bound for randomized leader
election, showing that $\Omega(\sqrt n)$ messages are needed for any leader
election algorithm that succeeds with probability at least $1/e + \eps$, for
any small constant $\eps > 0$.

seed contracts for different EVMs' execution, so as to find as many
inconsistencies among execution results as possible, eventually discover
vulnerabilities with output cross-referencing. First, we present the evaluation
metric for the internal inconsistency indicator, such as the opcode sequence
executed and gas used. Then, we construct seed contracts via a set of
predefined mutators and employ dynamic priority scheduling algorithm to guide
seed contracts selection and maximize the inconsistency. Finally, we leverage
different EVMs as crossreferencing oracles to avoid manual checking of the
execution output. For evaluation, we conducted large-scale mutation on 36,295
real-world smart contracts and generated 253,153 smart contracts. Among them,
66.2% showed differential performance, including 1,596 variant contracts

relying on centralized trust. Homomorphic encryption-based voting protocols

There are many existing protocols for voting using smart contracts. We observe
that these either are not scalable or leak the vote tally during the voting

1785,An Adaptive Gas Cost Mechanism for Ethereum to Defend Against Under-Priced DoS Attacks,"The gas mechanism in Ethereum charges the execution of every operation to

allows attackers to launch DoS attacks on Ethereum. Although Ethereum recently
adjusted the gas costs of EVM operations to defend against known DoS attacks,
it remains unknown whether the new setting is proper and how to configure it to
defend against unknown DoS attacks. In this paper, we make the first step to
address this challenging issue by first proposing an emulation-based framework
to automatically measure the resource consumptions of EVM operations. The
results reveal that Ethereum's new setting is still not proper. Moreover, we
obtain an insight that there may always exist exploitable under-priced
operations if the cost is fixed. Hence, we propose a novel gas cost mechanism,
which dynamically adjusts the costs of EVM operations according to the number
of executions, to thwart DoS attacks. This method punishes the operations that
are executed much more frequently than before and lead to high gas costs. To
make our solution flexible and secure and avoid frequent update of Ethereum
client, we design a special smart contract that collaborates with the updated
EVM for dynamic parameter adjustment. Experimental results demonstrate that our
method can effectively thwart both known and unknown DoS attacks with flexible

to meet standard/regulatory requirements, the error vector magnitude (EVM)
stemming from the PAPR reduction has a deleterious impact on the performance of
high data-rate achieving multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems.
Moreover, these systems must constrain the adjacent channel leakage ratio
(ACLR) to comply with regulatory requirements. Several recent works have
investigated the mitigation of the EVM seen at the receivers by capitalizing on
the excess spatial dimensions inherent in the large-scale MIMO that assume the
availability of perfect channel state information (CSI) with spatially
uncorrelated wireless channels. Unfortunately, practical systems operate with
erroneous CSI and spatially correlated channels. Additionally, most standards
support user-specific/CSI-aware beamformed and cell-specific/non-CSI-aware
broadcasting channels. Hence, we formulate a robust EVM mitigation problem

beamforming/broadcasting. To solve this formidable problem, we develop an

posted on-chain to be disputed by any party via an interactive fraud proof
(IFP) protocol. Existing systems that utilize this technique have demonstrated
up to a 20x reduction in transaction fees. The most popular ORUs today, in
active development, strive to extend existing Ethereum client software to
support IFP construction, aiming to reuse prior L1 engineering efforts and
replicate Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) semantics at L2. Unfortunately, to do
so they tightly couple their on-chain IFP verifier with a specific client
program binary--oblivious to its higher-level semantics. We argue that this
approach (1) precludes the trust-minimized, permissionless participation of
multiple Ethereum client programs, magnifying monoculture failure risk; (2)
leads to an unnecessarily large and complex trusted computing base that is
difficult to independently audit; and, (3) suffers from a frequently-triggered,
yet opaque upgrade process--both further increasing auditing overhead and
complicating on-chain access control. In this work, we aim to build a secure,
trust-minimized ORU that addresses these problems, while preserving scalability
and dispute resolution efficiency. To do so, we design an IFP system native to
the EVM, that enforces Ethereum's specified semantics precisely at the level of
a single EVM instruction. We present Specular, an ORU which leverages an
off-the-shelf Ethereum client--modified minimally to support IFP

equilibrium, new entrants/developers tend to adopt the dominant blockchain. To
avoid adoption failure, the alternative blockchains have to either (1) directly
subsidize the new entrant firms or (2) offer better features, which in practice
can take form in lower transaction costs, faster finality, or larger network
effects. We find that it is easier for EVM-compatible blockchains to attract
users through direct subsidy, while it is more efficient for EVM-incompatible
blockchains to attract users through offering better features/products.",2208.10269v1,cs.GT,2022-08-18 03:01:20+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Ruizhe Jia'), arxiv.Result.Author('Steven Yin')]",
1796,The Economics of Smart Contracts,"Ethereum is a distributed blockchain that can execute smart contracts, which
inter-communicate and perform transactions automatically. The execution of
smart contracts is paid in the form of gas, which is a monetary unit used in
the Ethereum blockchain. The Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) provides the
metering capability for smart contract execution. Instruction costs vary
depending on the instruction type and the approximate computational resources
required to execute the instruction on the network. The cost of gas is adjusted
using transaction fees to ensure adequate payment of the network. In this work,
we highlight the ""real"" economics of smart contracts. We show that the actual
costs of executing smart contracts are disproportionate to the computational
costs and that this gap is continuously widening. We show that the gas
cost-model of the underlying EVM instruction-set is wrongly modeled.
Specifically, the computational cost for the SLOAD instruction increases with
the length of the blockchain. Our proposed performance model estimates gas
usage and execution time of a smart contract at a given block-height. The new
gas-cost model incorporates the block-height to eliminate irregularities in the
Ethereum gas calculations. Our findings are based on extensive experiments over
the entire history of the EVM blockchain.",1910.11143v1,cs.DC,2019-10-23 03:36:37+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Kirk Baird'), arxiv.Result.Author('Seongho Jeong'), arxiv.Result.Author('Yeonsoo Kim'), arxiv.Result.Author('Bernd Burgstaller'), arxiv.Result.Author('Bernhard Scholz')]",
1797,EVM-Constrained and Mask-Compliant MIMO-OFDM Spectral Precoding,"Spectral precoding is a promising technique to suppress out-of-band emissions
and comply with leakage constraints over adjacent frequency channels and with
mask requirements on the unwanted emissions. However, spectral precoding may
distort the original data vector, which is formally expressed as the error
vector magnitude (EVM) between the precoded and original data vectors. Notably,
EVM has a deleterious impact on the performance of multiple-input
multiple-output orthogonal frequency division multiplexing-based systems. In
this paper we propose a novel spectral precoding approach which constrains the
EVM while complying with the mask requirements. We first formulate and solve
the EVM-unconstrained mask-compliant spectral precoding problem, which serves
as a springboard to the design of two EVM-constrained spectral precoding
schemes. The first scheme takes into account a wideband EVM-constraint which
limits the average in-band distortion. The second scheme takes into account
frequency-selective EVM-constraints, and consequently, limits the signal
distortion at the subcarrier level. Numerical examples illustrate that both
proposed schemes outperform previously developed schemes in terms of important
performance indicators such as block error rate and system-wide throughput
while complying with spectral mask and EVM constraints.",2009.12100v1,eess.SP,2020-09-25 09:36:31+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Shashi Kant'), arxiv.Result.Author('Mats Bengtsson'), arxiv.Result.Author('Gabor Fodor'), arxiv.Result.Author('Bo Göransson'), arxiv.Result.Author('Carlo Fischione')]",

secure multi party computation and are computationally efficient and secure

fertile ground for innovation and creativity. One of such disruptive innovation
is blockchain -- a keystone of cryptocurrencies. The blockchain technology is

1807,(Universal) Unconditional Verifiability in E-Voting without Trusted Parties,"In traditional e-voting protocols, privacy is often provided by a trusted
authority that learns the votes and computes the tally. Some protocols replace
the trusted authority by a set of authorities, and privacy is guaranteed if
less than a threshold number of authorities are corrupt. For verifiability,
stronger security guarantees are demanded. Typically, corrupt authorities that
try to fake the result of the tally must always be detected.
  To provide verifiability, many e-voting protocols use Non-Interactive
Zero-Knowledge proofs (NIZKs). Thanks to their non-interactive nature, NIZKs
allow anybody, including third parties that do not participate in the protocol,
to verify the correctness of the tally. Therefore, NIZKs can be used to obtain
universal verifiability. Additionally, NIZKs also improve usability because
they allow voters to cast a vote using a non-interactive protocol.
  The disadvantage of NIZKs is that their security is based on setup
assumptions such as the common reference string (CRS) or the random oracle (RO)
model. The former requires a trusted party for the generation of a common
reference string. The latter, though a popular methodology for designing secure
protocols, has been shown to be unsound.
  In this paper, we address the design of an e-voting protocol that provides
verifiability without any trust assumptions, where verifiability here is meant
without eligibility verification. We show that Non-Interactive
Witness-Indistinguishable proofs (NIWI) can be used for this purpose. The
e-voting scheme is private under the Decision Linear assumption, while
verifiability holds unconditionally. To our knowledge, this is the first
private e-voting scheme with perfect universal verifiability, i.e. one in which
the probability of a fake tally not being detected is 0, and with {\em
non-interactive} protocols that does not rely on trust assumptions.",1610.06343v1,cs.CR,2016-10-20 09:57:12+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Gina Gallegos-Garcia'), arxiv.Result.Author('Vincenzo Iovino'), arxiv.Result.Author('Alfredo Rial'), arxiv.Result.Author('Peter B.

1820,Limiting Risk by Turning Manifest Phantoms into Evil Zombies,"Drawing a random sample of ballots to conduct a risk-limiting audit generally
requires knowing how the ballots cast in an election are organized into groups,
for instance, how many containers of ballots there are in all and how many
ballots are in each container. A list of the ballot group identifiers along
with number of ballots in each group is called a ballot manifest. What if the
ballot manifest is not accurate? Surprisingly, even if ballots are known to be
missing from the manifest, it is not necessary to make worst-case assumptions
about those ballots--for instance, to adjust the margin by the number of
missing ballots--to ensure that the audit remains conservative. Rather, it
suffices to make worst-case assumptions about the individual randomly selected
ballots that the audit cannot find. This observation provides a simple
modification to some risk-limiting audit procedures that makes them
automatically become more conservative if the ballot manifest has errors. The
modification--phantoms to evil zombies (~2EZ)--requires only an upper bound on
the total number of ballots cast. ~2EZ makes the audit P-value stochastically
larger than it would be had the manifest been accurate, automatically requiring
more than enough ballots to be audited to offset the manifest errors. This
ensures that the true risk limit remains smaller than the nominal risk limit.
On the other hand, if the manifest is in fact accurate and the upper bound on

audits draw many ballots in a single round before determining whether to stop
(round-by-round (R2) audits). We show that BRAVO results in significant
inefficiency when directly applied to real R2 audits. We present the ATHENA
class of R2 stopping rules, which we show are risk-limiting if the round

Further, ATHENA reduces the number of ballots by more than a quarter for low
margins, when compared to the BRAVO stopping rule applied on ballots in
selection order. This implies that keeping track of the order when drawing
ballots R2 is not beneficial, because ATHENA is more efficient even without
information on selection order. These results are significant because current
approaches to real ballot polling election audits use the B2 BRAVO rules,

not require identification numbers on the ballots or counting many ballots per

justifiably high confidence that the reported results of an election are
consistent with an audit trail (""ballots""), which can be paper or electronic.
SOBA combines three ideas: (1) publishing cast vote records (CVRs) separately
for each contest, so that anyone can verify that each reported contest outcome
is correct, if the CVRs reflect voters' intentions with sufficient accuracy;
(2) shrouding a mapping between ballots and the CVRs for those ballots to
prevent the loss of privacy that could occur otherwise; (3) assessing the
accuracy with which the CVRs reflect voters' intentions for a collection of
contests while simultaneously assessing the integrity of the shrouded mapping
between ballots and CVRs by comparing randomly selected ballots to the CVRs
that purport to represent them. Step (1) is related to work by the Humboldt
County Election Transparency Project, but publishing CVRs separately for
individual contests rather than images of entire ballots preserves privacy.
Step (2) requires a cryptographic commitment from elections officials.
Observers participate in step (3), which relies on the ""super-simple
simultaneous single-ballot risk-limiting audit."" Step (3) is designed to reveal
relatively few ballots if the shrouded mapping is proper and the CVRs
accurately reflect voter intent. But if the reported outcomes of the contests
differ from the outcomes that a full hand count would show, step (3) is

Recent studies (e.g., Bernhard, et al. 2020) suggest the verification rate is

of voters being unable to do so accurately or whether this is because voters
simply choose not to attempt verification in the first place. In order to
understand this problem, we conducted an experiment in which 108 participants
participated in a mock election where the BMD displayed the voters' true
choices, but then changed a subset of those choices on the printed ballot. The
design of the printed ballot, the length of the ballot, the number of changes
that were made to the ballot, the location of those changes, and the
instructions provided to the voters were manipulated as part of the experiment.
Results indicated that of those voters who chose to examine the printed ballot,
76% detected anomalies, indicating that voters can reliably detect errors on
their ballot if they will simply review it. This suggests that administrative

influence the outcome of an election, given fixed voter preferences. We show
that there exist preference profiles over $k$ candidates such that up to $k-1$
different candidates win at different ballot lengths. We derive exact lower
bounds on the number of voters required for such profiles and provide a
construction matching the lower bound for unrestricted voter preferences.
Additionally, we characterize which sequences of winners are possible over
ballot lengths and provide explicit profile constructions achieving any
feasible winner sequence. We also examine how classic preference restrictions
influence our results--for instance, single-peakedness makes $k-1$ different
winners impossible but still allows at least $\Omega(\sqrt k)$. Finally, we
analyze a collection of 168 real-world elections, where we truncate rankings to
simulate shorter ballots. We find that shorter ballots could have changed the
outcome in one quarter of these elections. Our results highlight ballot length

requires knowing how the ballots cast in an election are organized into groups,
for instance, how many containers of ballots there are in all and how many
ballots are in each container. A list of the ballot group identifiers along
with number of ballots in each group is called a ballot manifest. What if the
ballot manifest is not accurate? Surprisingly, even if ballots are known to be
missing from the manifest, it is not necessary to make worst-case assumptions
about those ballots--for instance, to adjust the margin by the number of
missing ballots--to ensure that the audit remains conservative. Rather, it
suffices to make worst-case assumptions about the individual randomly selected
ballots that the audit cannot find. This observation provides a simple
modification to some risk-limiting audit procedures that makes them
automatically become more conservative if the ballot manifest has errors. The
modification--phantoms to evil zombies (~2EZ)--requires only an upper bound on
the total number of ballots cast. ~2EZ makes the audit P-value stochastically
larger than it would be had the manifest been accurate, automatically requiring
more than enough ballots to be audited to offset the manifest errors. This
ensures that the true risk limit remains smaller than the nominal risk limit.

Recent studies (e.g., Bernhard, et al. 2020) suggest the verification rate is
low. What is not clear from previous research is whether this is more a result
of voters being unable to do so accurately or whether this is because voters
simply choose not to attempt verification in the first place. In order to
understand this problem, we conducted an experiment in which 108 participants
participated in a mock election where the BMD displayed the voters' true

instructions provided to the voters were manipulated as part of the experiment.
Results indicated that of those voters who chose to examine the printed ballot,
76% detected anomalies, indicating that voters can reliably detect errors on
their ballot if they will simply review it. This suggests that administrative

1851,30 to 100-kG magnetic fields in the cores of red giant stars,"A red giant star is an evolved low- or intermediate-mass star that has
exhausted its central hydrogen content, leaving a helium core and a
hydrogen-burning shell. Oscillations of stars can be observed as periodic
dimmings and brightenings in the optical light curves. In red giant stars,
non-radial acoustic waves couple to gravity waves and give rise to mixed modes,
which behave as pressure (p) modes in the envelope and gravity (g) modes in the
core. These modes were previously used to measure the internal rotation of red
giants, leading to the conclusion that purely hydrodynamical processes of
angular momentum transport from the core are too inefficient. Magnetic fields
could produce the additional required transport. However, due to the lack of
direct measurements of magnetic fields in stellar interiors, very little is
currently known about their properties. Asteroseismology can provide direct
detection of magnetic fields because, like rotation, the fields induce shifts
in the oscillation mode frequencies. Here we report the measurement of magnetic
fields in the cores of three red giant stars observed with the Kepler
satellite. The fields induce shifts that break the symmetry of dipole mode
multiplets. We thus measure field strengths ranging from ~30 to ~100 kG in the

evidence against or in support of the recorded result. Risk-limiting audits for
first-past-the-post elections are well understood, and used in some US

traditional plurality voting in which voters submit rankings over the
candidates rather than single votes. In practice, elections using IRV often
restrict the ballot length, the number of candidates a voter is allowed to rank
on their ballot. We theoretically and empirically analyze how ballot length can
influence the outcome of an election, given fixed voter preferences. We show
that there exist preference profiles over $k$ candidates such that up to $k-1$
different candidates win at different ballot lengths. We derive exact lower
bounds on the number of voters required for such profiles and provide a
construction matching the lower bound for unrestricted voter preferences.
Additionally, we characterize which sequences of winners are possible over
ballot lengths and provide explicit profile constructions achieving any
feasible winner sequence. We also examine how classic preference restrictions
influence our results--for instance, single-peakedness makes $k-1$ different
winners impossible but still allows at least $\Omega(\sqrt k)$. Finally, we
analyze a collection of 168 real-world elections, where we truncate rankings to
simulate shorter ballots. We find that shorter ballots could have changed the
outcome in one quarter of these elections. Our results highlight ballot length

1860,Limiting Risk by Turning Manifest Phantoms into Evil Zombies,"Drawing a random sample of ballots to conduct a risk-limiting audit generally
requires knowing how the ballots cast in an election are organized into groups,
for instance, how many containers of ballots there are in all and how many
ballots are in each container. A list of the ballot group identifiers along
with number of ballots in each group is called a ballot manifest. What if the
ballot manifest is not accurate? Surprisingly, even if ballots are known to be
missing from the manifest, it is not necessary to make worst-case assumptions
about those ballots--for instance, to adjust the margin by the number of
missing ballots--to ensure that the audit remains conservative. Rather, it
suffices to make worst-case assumptions about the individual randomly selected
ballots that the audit cannot find. This observation provides a simple
modification to some risk-limiting audit procedures that makes them
automatically become more conservative if the ballot manifest has errors. The
modification--phantoms to evil zombies (~2EZ)--requires only an upper bound on
the total number of ballots cast. ~2EZ makes the audit P-value stochastically
larger than it would be had the manifest been accurate, automatically requiring
more than enough ballots to be audited to offset the manifest errors. This
ensures that the true risk limit remains smaller than the nominal risk limit.
On the other hand, if the manifest is in fact accurate and the upper bound on
the total number of ballots equals the total according to the manifest, ~2EZ
has no effect at all on the number of ballots audited nor on the true risk
limit.",1207.3413v1,stat.AP,2012-07-14 11:26:02+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Jorge H. Banuelos'), arxiv.Result.Author('Philip B. Stark')]",

changes from the slate they used to vote. Overall accuracy was exceptionally
high. Participants saw 1440 total contests, and of those 1440, there were a
total of 4 errors, so total accuracy was 99.8%. Participants were able to
perform with near-perfect accuracy regardless of ballot length, ballot type,
number of altered races, and location of altered races. Detection performance
was extremely robust. We conclude that with proper direction and resources,
voters can be near-perfect detectors of ballot changes on printed paper ballots

Menu"" consisting of several prices. In equilibrium, the adversary can buy the
real ballots of any strict subset of districts at a price corresponding to the
willingness to sell on the part of the citizens holding such ballots. By
contrast, decoy voters are trapped into selling their ballots at a low, or even
negligible, price. Blowing up the adversary's budget by introducing decoy
ballots may thus turn out to be futile. The Devil's Menu can also be applied to

1865,The ATHENA Class of Risk-Limiting Ballot Polling Audits,"The main risk-limiting ballot polling audit in use today, BRAVO, is designed
for use when single ballots are drawn at random and a decision regarding
whether to stop the audit or draw another ballot is taken after each ballot
draw (ballot-by-ballot (B2) audits). On the other hand, real ballot polling
audits draw many ballots in a single round before determining whether to stop
(round-by-round (R2) audits). We show that BRAVO results in significant
inefficiency when directly applied to real R2 audits. We present the ATHENA
class of R2 stopping rules, which we show are risk-limiting if the round
schedule is pre-determined (before the audit begins). We prove that each rule
is at least as efficient as the corresponding BRAVO stopping rule applied at
the end of the round. We have open-source software libraries implementing most
of our results.
  We show that ATHENA halves the number of ballots required, for all state
margins in the 2016 US Presidential election and a first round with $90\%$
stopping probability, when compared to BRAVO (stopping rule applied at the end
of the round). We present simulation results supporting the 90% stopping
probability claims and our claims for the risk accrued in the first round.
Further, ATHENA reduces the number of ballots by more than a quarter for low
margins, when compared to the BRAVO stopping rule applied on ballots in
selection order. This implies that keeping track of the order when drawing
ballots R2 is not beneficial, because ATHENA is more efficient even without
information on selection order. These results are significant because current
approaches to real ballot polling election audits use the B2 BRAVO rules,
requiring about twice as much work on the part of election officials. Applying
the rules in selection order requires fewer ballots, but keeping track of the

1870,"Voter Verification of BMD Ballots Is a Two-Part Question: Can They? Mostly, They Can. Do They? Mostly, They Don't","The question of whether or not voters actually verify ballots produced by
ballot marking devices (BMDs) is presently the subject of some controversy.
Recent studies (e.g., Bernhard, et al. 2020) suggest the verification rate is
low. What is not clear from previous research is whether this is more a result
of voters being unable to do so accurately or whether this is because voters
simply choose not to attempt verification in the first place. In order to
understand this problem, we conducted an experiment in which 108 participants
participated in a mock election where the BMD displayed the voters' true
choices, but then changed a subset of those choices on the printed ballot. The
design of the printed ballot, the length of the ballot, the number of changes
that were made to the ballot, the location of those changes, and the
instructions provided to the voters were manipulated as part of the experiment.
Results indicated that of those voters who chose to examine the printed ballot,
76% detected anomalies, indicating that voters can reliably detect errors on
their ballot if they will simply review it. This suggests that administrative
remedies, rather than attempts to alter fundamental human perceptual
capabilities, could be employed to encourage voters to check their ballots,
which could prove as an effective countermeasure.",2003.04997v1,cs.HC,2020-03-10 21:06:42+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Philip Kortum'), arxiv.Result.Author('Michael D. Byrne'), arxiv.Result.Author('Julie Whitmore')]",
1871,30 to 100-kG magnetic fields in the cores of red giant stars,"A red giant star is an evolved low- or intermediate-mass star that has
exhausted its central hydrogen content, leaving a helium core and a
hydrogen-burning shell. Oscillations of stars can be observed as periodic
dimmings and brightenings in the optical light curves. In red giant stars,
non-radial acoustic waves couple to gravity waves and give rise to mixed modes,
which behave as pressure (p) modes in the envelope and gravity (g) modes in the
core. These modes were previously used to measure the internal rotation of red
giants, leading to the conclusion that purely hydrodynamical processes of
angular momentum transport from the core are too inefficient. Magnetic fields
could produce the additional required transport. However, due to the lack of
direct measurements of magnetic fields in stellar interiors, very little is
currently known about their properties. Asteroseismology can provide direct
detection of magnetic fields because, like rotation, the fields induce shifts
in the oscillation mode frequencies. Here we report the measurement of magnetic
fields in the cores of three red giant stars observed with the Kepler
satellite. The fields induce shifts that break the symmetry of dipole mode
multiplets. We thus measure field strengths ranging from ~30 to ~100 kG in the
vicinity of the hydrogen-burning shell and place constraints on the field

evidence against or in support of the recorded result. Risk-limiting audits for
first-past-the-post elections are well understood, and used in some US

risk-limiting audits for Instant Runoff Voting (IRV) elections. We show that

traditional plurality voting in which voters submit rankings over the
candidates rather than single votes. In practice, elections using IRV often
restrict the ballot length, the number of candidates a voter is allowed to rank
on their ballot. We theoretically and empirically analyze how ballot length can
influence the outcome of an election, given fixed voter preferences. We show
that there exist preference profiles over $k$ candidates such that up to $k-1$
different candidates win at different ballot lengths. We derive exact lower
bounds on the number of voters required for such profiles and provide a
construction matching the lower bound for unrestricted voter preferences.
Additionally, we characterize which sequences of winners are possible over
ballot lengths and provide explicit profile constructions achieving any
feasible winner sequence. We also examine how classic preference restrictions
influence our results--for instance, single-peakedness makes $k-1$ different
winners impossible but still allows at least $\Omega(\sqrt k)$. Finally, we
analyze a collection of 168 real-world elections, where we truncate rankings to
simulate shorter ballots. We find that shorter ballots could have changed the
outcome in one quarter of these elections. Our results highlight ballot length

relevant disputes for a generic, practically relevant, class of voting
protocols. Based on our characterization, we propose a new definition of
dispute resolution for voting that accounts for the possibility that both
voters and the voting authority can make false claims and that voters may
abstain from voting.
  A central aspect of our work is timeliness: a voter should possess the
evidence required to resolve disputes no later than the election's end. We
characterize what assumptions are necessary and sufficient for timeliness in
terms of a communication topology for our voting protocol class. We formalize
the dispute resolution properties and communication topologies symbolically.
This provides the basis for verification of dispute resolution for a broad
class of protocols. To demonstrate the utility of our model, we analyze a
mixnet-based voting protocol and prove that it satisfies dispute resolution as
well as verifiability and receipt-freeness. To prove our claims, we combine

w.r.t.~their votes proportion. For this ratio, we show small constant
worst-case bounds for the Shapley-Shubik and the Deegan-Packel indices. In
sharp contrast, this ratio is unbounded for the Banzhaf index. As an
application, we define a false-name strategic normal form game where each big

splitting problem, the beneficial merging problem asks whether a coalition of
players can increase their power in a weighted voting game by merging their
weights. Aziz et al. [ABEP11] analyze the problem of whether merging or
splitting players in weighted voting games is beneficial in terms of the
Shapley-Shubik and the normalized Banzhaf index, and so do Rey and Rothe [RR10]
for the probabilistic Banzhaf index. All these results provide merely
NP-hardness lower bounds for these problems, leaving the question about their
exact complexity open. For the Shapley--Shubik and the probabilistic Banzhaf
index, we raise these lower bounds to hardness for PP, ""probabilistic
polynomial time"", and provide matching upper bounds for beneficial merging and,
whenever the number of false identities is fixed, also for beneficial
splitting, thus resolving previous conjectures in the affirmative. It follows

split is also provided. Bachrach and Elkind also mentioned manipulation via
merging as an open problem. In the paper, we examine the cases where a player
annexes other players or merges with them to increase their Banzhaf index or
Shapley-Shubik index payoff. We characterize the computational complexity of
such manipulations and provide limits to the manipulation. The annexation

1892,Learning Hough Regression Models via Bridge Partial Least Squares for Object Detection,"Popular Hough Transform-based object detection approaches usually construct
an appearance codebook by clustering local image features. However, how to
choose appropriate values for the parameters used in the clustering step
remains an open problem. Moreover, some popular histogram features extracted
from overlapping image blocks may cause a high degree of redundancy and
multicollinearity. In this paper, we propose a novel Hough Transform-based
object detection approach. First, to address the above issues, we exploit a
Bridge Partial Least Squares (BPLS) technique to establish context-encoded
Hough Regression Models (HRMs), which are linear regression models that cast
probabilistic Hough votes to predict object locations. BPLS is an efficient
variant of Partial Least Squares (PLS). PLS-based regression techniques
(including BPLS) can reduce the redundancy and eliminate the multicollinearity
of a feature set. And the appropriate value of the only parameter used in PLS
(i.e., the number of latent components) can be determined by using a
cross-validation procedure. Second, to efficiently handle object scale changes,
we propose a novel multi-scale voting scheme. In this scheme, multiple Hough
images corresponding to multiple object scales can be obtained simultaneously.
Third, an object in a test image may correspond to multiple true and false
positive hypotheses at different scales. Based on the proposed multi-scale
voting scheme, a principled strategy is proposed to fuse hypotheses to reduce
false positives by evaluating normalized pointwise mutual information between
hypotheses. In the experiments, we also compare the proposed HRM approach with
its several variants to evaluate the influences of its components on its
performance. Experimental results show that the proposed HRM approach has
achieved desirable performances on popular benchmark datasets.",1603.08092v1,cs.CV,2016-03-26 09:33:30+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Jianyu Tang'), arxiv.Result.Author('Hanzi Wang'), arxiv.Result.Author('Yan Yan')]","Neurocomputing, 2015,152(3):236-249"

poses is tedious and erroneous, and also fails to generalize to unseen
scenarios. Besides, category-level pose estimation requires a method to be able
to generalize to unseen objects at test time, which is also challenging.
Drawing inspirations from traditional point pair features (PPFs), in this
paper, we design a novel Category-level PPF (CPPF) voting method to achieve
accurate, robust and generalizable 9D pose estimation in the wild. To obtain
robust pose estimation, we sample numerous point pairs on an object, and for
each pair our model predicts necessary SE(3)-invariant voting statistics on
object centers, orientations and scales. A novel coarse-to-fine voting
algorithm is proposed to eliminate noisy point pair samples and generate final
predictions from the population. To get rid of false positives in the
orientation voting process, an auxiliary binary disambiguating classification
task is introduced for each sampled point pair. In order to detect objects in
the wild, we carefully design our sim-to-real pipeline by training on synthetic
point clouds only, unless objects have ambiguous poses in geometry. Under this
circumstance, color information is leveraged to disambiguate these poses.
Results on standard benchmarks show that our method is on par with current
state of the arts with real-world training data. Extensive experiments further
show that our method is robust to noise and gives promising results under
extremely challenging scenarios. Our code is available on

and in a timely manner out of a large number of false candidates, obtained with
the standard difference-imaging method. We have developed the transient
selector which is based on majority voting of three ML machines of AUC
Boosting, Random Forest, and Deep Neural Network. We applied it to our
observing runs of Subaru-HSC in 2015 May and August, and proved it to be
efficient in selecting optical transients. The false positive rate was 1.0% at
the true positive rate of 90% in the magnitude range of 22.0--25.0 mag for the
former data. For the latter run, we successfully detected and reported ten
candidates of supernovae within the same day as the observation. From these

1895,"They may look and look, yet not see: BMDs cannot be tested adequately","Bugs, misconfiguration, and malware can cause ballot-marking devices (BMDs)
to print incorrect votes. Several approaches to testing BMDs have been
proposed. In logic and accuracy testing (LAT) and parallel or live testing,
auditors input known test votes into the BMD and check the printout. Passive
testing monitors the rate of ""spoiled"" BMD printout, on the theory that if BMDs
malfunction, the rate will increase noticeably. We show that these approaches
cannot reliably detect outcome-altering problems, because: (i) The number of
possible interactions with BMDs is enormous, so testing interactions uniformly
at random is hopeless. (ii) To probe the space of interactions intelligently
requires an accurate model of voter behavior, but because the space of
interactions is so large, building an accurate model requires observing a huge
number of voters in every jurisdiction in every election--more voters than
there are in most jurisdictions. (iii) Even with a perfect model of voter
behavior, the number of tests needed exceeds the number of voters in most
jurisdictions. (iv) An attacker can target interactions that are expensive to
test, e.g., because they involve voting slowly; or interactions for which
tampering is less likely to be noticed, e.g., because the voter uses the audio
interface. (v) Whether BMDs misbehave or not, the distribution of spoiled
ballots is unknown and varies by election and possibly by ballot style:
historical data do not help much. Hence, there is no way to calibrate a
threshold for passive testing, e.g., to guarantee at least a 95% chance of
noticing that 5% of the votes were altered, with at most a 5% false alarm rate.
(vi) Even if the distribution of spoiled ballots were known to be Poisson, the
vast majority of jurisdictions do not have enough voters for passive testing to
have a large chance of detecting problems but only a small chance of false
alarms.",1908.08144v4,stat.AP,2019-08-21 23:39:04+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Philip B. Stark'), arxiv.Result.Author('Ran Xie')]",

polls conducted during the recall referendum that took place in Venezuela on

polls considered here were conducted independently by S\'{u}mate, a
nongovernmental organization, and Primero Justicia, a political party. We find
significant discrepancies between the exit poll data and the official CNE

show that discrepancies between exit polls and official results are not due to
a biased selection of the voting centers or to problems related to the size of
the samples taken at each center. We found discrepancies in all the states
where the polls were conducted. We do not have enough information on the exit
poll data to determine whether the observed discrepancies are the consequence
of systematic biases in the selection of the people interviewed by the
pollsters around the country. Neither do we have information to study the
possibility of a high number of false or nonrespondents. We have limited data
suggesting that the discrepancies are not due to a drastic change in the voting

decision-making domains. In such games, each player has a weight, and a
coalition of players wins the game if its total weight meets or exceeds a given
quota. A players power in such games is usually not directly proportional to
his weight, and is measured by a power index, the most prominent among which
are the Shapley-Shubik index and the Banzhaf index.In this paper, we
investigate by how much a player can change his power, as measured by the
Shapley-Shubik index or the Banzhaf index, by means of a false-name
manipulation, i.e., splitting his weight among two or more identities. For both
indices, we provide upper and lower bounds on the effect of weight-splitting.
We then show that checking whether a beneficial split exists is NP-hard, and
discuss efficient algorithms for restricted cases of this problem, as well as
randomized algorithms for the general case. We also provide an experimental
evaluation of these algorithms. Finally, we examine related forms of
manipulative behavior, such as annexation, where a player subsumes other
players, or merging, where several players unite into one. We characterize the
computational complexity of such manipulations and provide limits on their
effects. For the Banzhaf index, we describe a new paradox, which we term the

breaking caused by panic escape exhibits a shared feature across species that
one exit is used more than the other when agents escaping from a closed space
with two symmetrically located exists. Intuitively, one exit will be used more
by more individuals close to it, namely there is an asymmetric distribution
initially. We used ant groups to investigate how initial distribution of
colonies would influence symmetry breaking in collective escaping.
Surprisingly, there was no positive correlation between symmetry breaking and
the asymmetrically initial distribution, which was quite counter-intuitive. In
the experiments, a flee stage was observed and accordingly a flee-pheromone
model was introduced to depict this special behavior in the early stage of
escaping. Simulation results fitted well with the experiment. Furthermore, the
flee stage duration was calibrated quantitatively and the model reproduced the
observation demonstrated by our previous work. This paper explicitly
distinguished two stages in ant panic escaping for the first time, thus

in the field theory side is given by the area of some particular surfaces in
the gravity side. In this paper we find the holographic counterpart of the
first law of entanglement entropy (FLEE) in a two-dimensional BMSFT. We show
that FLEE for the BMSFT perturbed states which are descried by
three-dimensional flat-space cosmology, corresponds to the integral of a
particular one-form on a closed curve. This curve consists of BMSFT interval
and also null and spacelike geodesics in the bulk gravitational theory.
Exterior derivative of this form is zero when it is calculated for the

anti-polarization: competing candidates move to the center of the ideological
distribution to maximize vote share, regardless of the underlying ideological
distribution of voters. These anti-polar results, however, largely depend on
the ""singled-peakedness"" of voter preferences, an assumption that is rapidly
loosing relevance in the age of polarization. This article presents a model of
voter choice that examines three potential mechanisms that can undermine this
finding: a relative cost of voting that deters voters who are sufficiently
indifferent to both candidates, ideologically motivated third-party
alternatives that attract extreme voters, and a bimodal distribution of voter
ideology. Under reasonable sets of conditions and empirically observed voter
opinion distributions, these mechanisms can be sufficient to cause

1905,A Fault Tolerance Improved Majority Voter for TMR System Architectures,"For digital system designs, triple modular redundancy (TMR), which is a
3-tuple version of N-modular redundancy is widely preferred for many
mission-control and safety-critical applications. The TMR scheme involves
two-times duplication of the simplex system hardware, with a majority voter
ensuring correctness provided at least two out of three copies of the system
remain operational. Thus the majority voter plays a pivotal role in ensuring
the correct operation of the system. The fundamental assumption implicit in the
TMR scheme is that the majority voter does not become faulty, which may not
hold well for implementations based on latest technology nodes with dimensions
of the order of just tens of nanometers. To overcome the drawbacks of the
classical majority voter some new voter designs were put forward in the
literature with the aim of enhancing the fault tolerance. However, these voter
designs generally ensure the correct system operation in the presence of either
a faulty function module or the faulty voter, considered only in isolation.
Since multiple faults may no longer be excluded in the nanoelectronics regime,
simultaneous fault occurrences on both the function module and the voter should
be considered, and the fault tolerance of the voters have to be analyzed under
such a scenario. In this context, this article proposes a new fault-tolerant
majority voter which is found to be more robust to faults than the existing
voters in the presence of faults occurring internally and/or externally to the
voter. Moreover, the proposed voter features less power dissipation, delay, and
area metrics based on the simulation results obtained by using a 32/28nm CMOS

toaffect the result of an election by adding or deleting the fewest number of
voters. The goal of the agent is to make a specific candidate either win
(\emph{constructive} control) or lose (\emph{destructive} control) the
election. We study the constructive and destructive voter control problems
whenadding and deleting voters have a \emph{combinatorial flavor}: If we add
(resp.\ delete) a voter~$v$, we also add (resp.\ delete) a bundle~$\kappa(v) $
of voters that are associated with~$v$. While the bundle~$\kappa(v)$ may have
more than one voter, a voter may also be associated with more than one voter.
We analyze the computational complexity of the four voter control problems for
the Plurality rule. We obtain that, in general, making a candidate lose is
computationally easier than making her win. In particular, if the bundling
relation is symmetric (i.e.\ $\forall w\colon w \in \kappa(v) \Leftrightarrow v
\in \kappa(w) $), and if each voter has at most two voters associated with him,
then destructive control is polynomial-time solvable while the constructive
variant remains $\NP$-hard. Even if the bundles are disjoint (i.e.\ $\forall
w\colon w \in \kappa(v) \Leftrightarrow \kappa(v) = \kappa(w) $), the
constructive problem variants remain intractable. Finally, the minimization
variant of constructive control by adding voters does not admit an efficient

aggregate data to enhance our estimate under the assumption that nearby voters
have similar behavior, which could be due to social interaction or common
external factors. Finally, we use a ranking scheme on these predictions to
identify two key types of voter: 1) Voters who are likely to vote that we can
convince to vote for a given party; and, 2) Voters who are likely to vote for a
given party, if they vote, that we can convince to actually turn out to vote.
Once these voters have been identified, a political campaign can use this

ensures the integrity of the voter's real credential while enabling the
creation of fake credentials using interactive zero-knowledge proofs between
the voter as the verifier and the kiosk as the prover, unbeknownst to the
average voter. TRIP ensures that even voters who are under extreme coercion,
and cannot leave the booth with a real credential, can delegate their vote to a
political party, with the caveat that they must then trust the kiosk. TRIP
optimizes the tallying process by limiting the number of credentials a voter
can receive and capping the number of votes that a credential can cast per
election. We conduct a preliminary usability study among 41 participants at a

the prey animal cannot know the state of its environment with certainty, and is
thus bound to make some errors. We formulate a probabilistic automaton model of
a prey animal's life and use it to compute the optimal escape decision
strategy, subject to the animal's uncertainty. The uncertainty is a major
factor in determining the decision strategy: only in the presence of
uncertainty do economic factors (like mating opportunities lost due to flight)
influence the decision. We performed computer simulations and found that
\emph{in silico} populations of animals subject to predation evolve to display
the strategies predicted by our model, confirming our choice of objective
function for our analytic calculations. To the best of our knowledge, this is

1915,k-Majority Digraphs and the Hardness of Voting with a Constant Number of Voters,"Many hardness results in computational social choice make use of the fact
that every directed graph may be induced as the pairwise majority relation of

almost linear in the number of alternatives. It is therefore unclear whether
these results remain intact when the number of voters is bounded, as is, for
example, typically the case in search engine aggregation settings. In this
paper, we provide a systematic study of majority digraphs for a constant number
of voters resulting in analytical, experimental, and complexity-theoretic
insights. First, we characterize the set of digraphs that can be induced by two
and three voters, respectively, and give sufficient conditions for larger
numbers of voters. Second, we present a surprisingly efficient implementation
via SAT solving for computing the minimal number of voters that is required to
induce a given digraph and experimentally evaluate how many voters are required
to induce the majority digraphs of real-world and generated preference
profiles. Finally, we leverage our sufficient conditions to show that the
winner determination problem of various well-known voting rules remains hard

show that Kemeny's rule is hard to evaluate for 7 voters, while previous

1916,Reputation-Driven Voting Dynamics,"We introduce the reputational voter model (RVM) to account for the
time-varying abilities of individuals to influence their neighbors. To
understand of the RVM, we first discuss the fitness voter model (FVM), in which
each voter has a fixed and distinct fitness. In a voting event where voter $i$
is fitter than voter $j$, only $j$ changes opinion. We show that the dynamics
of the FVM and the voter model are identical. We next discuss the adaptive
voter model (AVM), in which the influencing voter in a voting event increases
its fitness by a fixed amount. The dynamics of the AVM is non-stationary and
slowly crosses over to that of FVM because of the gradual broadening of the
fitness distribution of the population. Finally, we treat the RVM, in which the
voter $i$ is endowed with a reputational rank $r_i$ that ranges from 1 (highest
rank) to $N$ (lowest), where $N$ is the population size. In a voting event in
which voter $i$ outranks $j$, only the opinion of $j$ changes. Concomitantly,
the rank of $i$ increases, while that of $j$ does not change. The rank
distribution remains uniform on the integers $1,2,3,\ldots,N$, leading to
stationary dynamics. For equal number of voters in the two voting states with
these two subpopulations having the same average rand, the time to reach
consensus in the mean-field limit scales as $\exp(\sqrt{N})$. This long
consensus time arises because the average rank of the minority population is
typically higher than that of the majority. Thus whenever consensus is

1917,Slower is faster: Fostering consensus formation by heterogeneous intertia,"We investigate an extension of the voter model in which voters are equipped
with an individual inertia to change their opinion. This inertia depends on the
persistence time of a voter's current opinion (ageing). We focus on the case of
only two different inertia values: zero if a voter just changed towards a new
opinion and $\nu$ otherwise. We are interested in the average time to reach
consensus, i.e. the state in which all voters have adopted the same opinion.
Adding inertia to the system means to slow down the dynamics at the voter's
level, which should presumably lead to a slower consensus formation. As an
unexpected outcome of our inertial voter dynamics, there is a parameter region
of $\nu$ where an increasing inertia leads to a faster consensus formation.
These results rest on the heterogeneity of voters which evolves through the
described ageing. In a control setting of homogeneous inertia values, we only
find monotonously increasing consensus times. In the paper, we present
dynamical equations for the mean-field case which allow for analytical insight
into the observed slower-is-faster effect.",0904.0765v1,physics.soc-ph,2009-04-05 12:22:31+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Hans-Ulrich Stark'), arxiv.Result.Author('Claudio J. Tessone'), arxiv.Result.Author('Frank Schweitzer')]","ACS - Advances in Complex Systems, vol 11, no 4 (2008) pp. 87-116"
1918,On the Number of Single-Peaked Narcissistic or Single-Crossing Narcissistic Preference Profiles,"We investigate preference profiles for a set $\mathcal{V}$ of voters, where
each voter $i$ has a preference order $\succ_i$ on a finite set $A$ of
alternatives (that is, a linear order on $A$) such that for each two
alternatives $a,b\in A$, voter $i$ prefers $a$ to $b$ if $a\succ_i b$. Such a
profile is narcissistic if each alternative $a$ is preferred the most by at
least one voter. It is single-peaked if there is a linear order
$\triangleright^{\text{sp}}$ on the alternatives such that each voter's
preferences on the alternatives along the order $\triangleright^{\text{sp}}$
are either strictly increasing, or strictly decreasing, or first strictly
increasing and then strictly decreasing. It is single-crossing if there is a
linear order $\triangleright^{\text{sc}}$ on the voters such that each pair of
alternatives divides the order $\triangleright^{\text{sc}}$ into at most two
suborders, where in each suborder, all voters have the same linear order on
this pair.
  We show that for $n$ voters and $n$ alternatives,the number of single-peaked
narcissistic profiles is $\prod_{i=2}^{n-1} \binom{n-1}{i-1}$ while the number
of single-crossing narcissistic profiles is $2^{\binom{n-1}{2}}$.",1701.08652v2,math.CO,2017-01-25 16:45:43+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Jiehua Chen'), arxiv.Result.Author('Ugo P. Finnendahl')]",
1919,Multidimensional Manhattan Preferences,"A preference profile with $m$ alternatives and $n$ voters is $d$-Manhattan
(resp. $d$-Euclidean) if both the alternatives and the voters can be placed
into the $d$-dimensional space such that between each pair of alternatives,
every voter prefers the one which has a shorter Manhattan (resp. Euclidean)
distance to the voter. Following Bogomolnaia and Laslier [Journal of
Mathematical Economics, 2007] and Chen and Grottke [Social Choice and Welfare,
2021] who look at $d$-Euclidean preference profiles, we study which preference
profiles are $d$-Manhattan depending on the values $m$ and $n$.
  First, we show that each preference profile with $m$ alternatives and $n$
voters is $d$-Manhattan whenever $d$ $\geq$ min($n$, $m$-$1$). Second, for $d =
2$, we show that the smallest non $d$-Manhattan preference profile has either
three voters and six alternatives, or four voters and five alternatives, or
five voters and four alternatives. This is more complex than the case with
$d$-Euclidean preferences (see [Bogomolnaia and Laslier, 2007] and [Bulteau and
Chen, 2020].",2201.09691v1,cs.MA,2022-01-24 13:52:38+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Jiehua Chen'), arxiv.Result.Author('Martin Nöllenburg'), arxiv.Result.Author('Sofia Simola'), arxiv.Result.Author('Anaïs Villedieu'), arxiv.Result.Author('Markus Wallinger')]",
