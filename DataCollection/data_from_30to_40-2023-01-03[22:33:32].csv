0,On the security of ballot marking devices,"A recent debate among election experts has considered whether electronic
ballot marking devices (BMDs) have adequate security against the risks of
malware. A malicious BMD might produce a printed ballot that disagrees with a
voter's actual intent, with the hope that voters would be unlikely to detect
this subterfuge. This essay considers how an election administrator can create
reasonable auditing procedures to gain confidence that their fleet of BMDs is
operating correctly, allowing voters to benefit from the usability and
accessibility features of BMDs while the overall election still benefits from
the same security and reliability properties we expect from hand-marked paper
ballots.",1908.01897v2,cs.CR,2019-08-05 23:04:16+00:00,[arxiv.Result.Author('Dan S. Wallach')],
1,Printing and Scanning Attack for Image Counter Forensics,"Examining the authenticity of images has become increasingly important as
manipulation tools become more accessible and advanced. Recent work has shown
that while CNN-based image manipulation detectors can successfully identify
manipulations, they are also vulnerable to adversarial attacks, ranging from
simple double JPEG compression to advanced pixel-based perturbation. In this
paper we explore another method of highly plausible attack: printing and
scanning. We demonstrate the vulnerability of two state-of-the-art models to
this type of attack. We also propose a new machine learning model that performs
comparably to these state-of-the-art models when trained and validated on
printed and scanned images. Of the three models, our proposed model outperforms
the others when trained and validated on images from a single printer. To
facilitate this exploration, we create a dataset of over 6,000 printed and
scanned image blocks. Further analysis suggests that variation between images
produced from different printers is significant, large enough that good
validation accuracy on images from one printer does not imply similar
validation accuracy on identical images from a different printer.",2005.02160v2,cs.CV,2020-04-27 00:32:15+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Hailey James'), arxiv.Result.Author('Otkrist Gupta'), arxiv.Result.Author('Dan Raviv')]",
2,Locating ballot drop boxes,"For decades, voting-by-mail and the use of ballot drop boxes has
substantially grown, and in response, many election officials have added new
drop boxes to their voting infrastructure. However, existing guidance for
locating drop boxes is limited. In this paper, we introduce an integer
programming model, the drop box location problem (DBLP), to locate drop boxes.
The DBLP considers criteria of cost, voter access, and risk. The cost of the
drop box system is determined by the fixed cost of adding drop boxes and the
operational cost of a collection tour by a bipartisan team who regularly
collects ballots from selected locations. The DBLP utilizes covering sets to
ensure each voter is in close proximity to a drop box and incorporates a novel
measure of access to measure the ability to use multiple voting pathways to
vote. The DBLP is shown to be NP-Hard, and we introduce a heuristic to generate
a large number of feasible solutions for policy makers to select from a
posteriori. Using a real-world case study of Milwaukee, WI, we study the
benefit of the DBLP. The results demonstrate that the proposed optimization
model identifies drop box locations that perform well across multiple criteria.
The results also demonstrate that the trade-off between cost, access, and risk
is non-trivial, which supports the use of the proposed optimization-based
approach to select drop box locations.",2207.10707v2,math.OC,2022-07-21 18:41:38+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Adam P. Schmidt'), arxiv.Result.Author('Laura A. Albert')]",
3,Open5x: Accessible 5-axis 3D printing and conformal slicing,"The common layer-by-layer deposition of regular, 3-axis 3D printing
simplifies both the fabrication process and the 3D printer's mechanical design.
However, the resulting 3D printed objects have some unfavourable
characteristics including visible layers, uneven structural strength and
support material. To overcome these, researchers have employed robotic arms and
multi-axis CNCs to deposit materials in conformal layers. Conformal deposition
improves the quality of the 3D printed parts through support-less printing and
curved layer deposition. However, such multi-axis 3D printing is inaccessible
to many individuals due to high costs and technical complexities. Furthermore,
the limited GUI support for conformal slicers creates an additional barrier for
users. To open multi-axis 3D printing up to more makers and researchers, we
present a cheap and accessible way to upgrade a regular 3D printer to 5 axes.
We have also developed a GUI-based conformal slicer, integrated within a
popular CAD package. Together, these deliver an accessible workflow for
designing, simulating and creating conformally-printed 3D models.",2202.11426v2,cs.HC,2022-02-23 11:14:24+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Freddie Hong'), arxiv.Result.Author('Steve Hodges'), arxiv.Result.Author('Connor Myant'), arxiv.Result.Author('David Boyle')]",
4,Limiting Risk by Turning Manifest Phantoms into Evil Zombies,"Drawing a random sample of ballots to conduct a risk-limiting audit generally
requires knowing how the ballots cast in an election are organized into groups,
for instance, how many containers of ballots there are in all and how many
ballots are in each container. A list of the ballot group identifiers along
with number of ballots in each group is called a ballot manifest. What if the
ballot manifest is not accurate? Surprisingly, even if ballots are known to be
missing from the manifest, it is not necessary to make worst-case assumptions
about those ballots--for instance, to adjust the margin by the number of
missing ballots--to ensure that the audit remains conservative. Rather, it
suffices to make worst-case assumptions about the individual randomly selected
ballots that the audit cannot find. This observation provides a simple
modification to some risk-limiting audit procedures that makes them
automatically become more conservative if the ballot manifest has errors. The
modification--phantoms to evil zombies (~2EZ)--requires only an upper bound on
the total number of ballots cast. ~2EZ makes the audit P-value stochastically
larger than it would be had the manifest been accurate, automatically requiring
more than enough ballots to be audited to offset the manifest errors. This
ensures that the true risk limit remains smaller than the nominal risk limit.
On the other hand, if the manifest is in fact accurate and the upper bound on
the total number of ballots equals the total according to the manifest, ~2EZ
has no effect at all on the number of ballots audited nor on the true risk
limit.",1207.3413v1,stat.AP,2012-07-14 11:26:02+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Jorge H. Banuelos'), arxiv.Result.Author('Philip B. Stark')]",

We completely enumerate ballot permutations avoiding two patterns of length $3$

relations and formulas, which leads to an interesting bijection between ballot
permutations avoiding $132$ and $312$ with left factors of Dyck paths. In

7,"Signing Initiative Petitions Online: Possibilities, Problems and Prospects","Many people expect the Internet to change American politics, most likely in
the direction of increasing direct citizen participation and forcing government
officials to respond more quickly to voter concerns. A recent California
initiative with these objectives would authorize use of encrypted digital
signatures over the Internet to qualify candidates, initiatives, and other
ballot measures. Proponents of Internet signature gathering say it will
significantly lower the cost of qualifying initiatives and thereby reduce the
influence of organized, well-financed interest groups. They also believe it
will increase both public participation in the political process and public
understanding about specific measures. However, opponents question whether
Internet security is adequate to prevent widespread abuse and argue that the
measure would create disadvantages for those who lack access to the Internet.
Beyond issues of security, cost, and access lie larger questions about the
effects of Internet signature gathering on direct democracy. Would it encourage
greater and more informed public participation in the political process? Or
would it flood voters with ballot measures and generally worsen current
problems with the initiative process itself? Because we lack good data on these
questions, answers to them today are largely conjectural. We can be fairly
sure, however, that Internet petition signing, like Internet voting, will have
unintended consequences.",cs/0109049v1,cs.CY,2001-09-22 22:57:01+00:00,[arxiv.Result.Author('Walter S. Baer')],
8,Flexoskeleton printing for versatile insect-inspired robots,"One of the many secrets to the success and prevalence of insects is their
versatile, robust, and complex exoskeleton morphology. A fundamental challenge
in insect-inspired robotics has been the fabrication of robotic exoskeletons
that can match the complexity of exoskeleton structural mechanics. Hybrid
robots composed of rigid and soft elements have previously required access to
expensive multi-material 3D printers, multi-step casting and machining
processes, or limited material choice when using consumer-grade fabrication
methods. Here we introduce a new design and fabrication process to rapidly
construct flexible exoskeleton-inspired robots called flexoskeleton printing.
We modify a consumer-grade fused deposition material (FDM) 3D printer to
deposit filament directly onto a heated thermoplastic base layer which provides
extremely strong bond strength between the deposited material and the
inextensible, flexible base layer. This process significantly improves the
fatigue resistance of printed components and enables a new class of
insect-inspired robot morphologies. We demonstrate these capabilities through
design and testing of a wide library of canonical flexoskeleton elements;
ultimately leading to the integration of elements into a flexoskeleton walking
legged robot.",1911.06897v2,cs.RO,2019-11-15 22:37:37+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Mingsong Jiang'), arxiv.Result.Author('Ziyi Zhou'), arxiv.Result.Author('Nicholas G. Gravish')]",
9,Fabchain: Managing Audit-able 3D Print Job over Blockchain,"Improvements in fabrication devices such as 3D printers are becoming possible

liable for the product, the fabricator should keep the fabrication history in
an immutable and sustainably accessible manner. In this paper, we propose a new
scheme, ""Fabchain,"" that can record the fabrication history in such a manner.
By utilizing a scheme that employs a blockchain as an audit-able communication
channel, Fabchain manages print jobs for the fabricator's 3D printer over the
blockchain, while maintaining a history of a print job. We implemented Fabchain
on Ethereum and evaluated the performance for recording a print job. Our
results demonstrate that Fabchain can complete communication of a print job
sequence in less than 1 minute on the Ethereum test network. We conclude that
Fabchain can manage a print job in a reasonable duration for 3D printing, while
satisfying the requirements for immutability and sustainability.",2203.03119v1,cs.DC,2022-03-07 03:41:17+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Ryosuke Abe'), arxiv.Result.Author('Shigeya Suzuki'), arxiv.Result.Author('Kenji Saito'), arxiv.Result.Author('Hiroya Tanaka'), arxiv.Result.Author('Osamu Nakamura'), arxiv.Result.Author('Jun Murai')]",

tracking systems. The goals of these systems, to facilitate voter registration
and increase public confidence in elections, are laudable. They indisputably
provide a critical public good. It is for these reasons that understanding the
security and privacy posture of the mail-in voting process is paramount. We
find that online voter registration systems in some states have vulnerabilities
that allow adversaries to alter or effectively prevent a voter's registration.
We additionally find that ballot tracking systems raise serious privacy
questions surrounding ease of access to voter data. While the vulnerabilities
discussed here are unlikely to enable an adversary to modify votes, several
could have the effect of disenfranchising voters and reducing voter confidence

systems.",2005.08427v2,cs.CY,2020-05-18 02:18:15+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Jenny Blessing'), arxiv.Result.Author('Julian Gomez'), arxiv.Result.Author('McCoy Patiño'), arxiv.Result.Author('Tran Nguyen')]",
11,Can Voters Detect Errors on Their Printed Ballots? Absolutely,"There is still debate on whether voters can detect malicious changes in their
printed ballot after making their selections on a Ballot Marking Device (BMD).
In this study, we altered votes on a voter's ballot after they had made their
selections on a BMD. We then required them to examine their ballots for any
changes from the slate they used to vote. Overall accuracy was exceptionally
high. Participants saw 1440 total contests, and of those 1440, there were a
total of 4 errors, so total accuracy was 99.8%. Participants were able to
perform with near-perfect accuracy regardless of ballot length, ballot type,
number of altered races, and location of altered races. Detection performance
was extremely robust. We conclude that with proper direction and resources,
voters can be near-perfect detectors of ballot changes on printed paper ballots
after voting with a BMD. This finding has significant implications for the
voting community as BMD use continues to grow. Research should now focus on
identifying administrative and behavioral methods that will prompt and

16,Measuring and mitigating voting access disparities: a study of race and polling locations in Florida and North Carolina,"Voter suppression and associated racial disparities in access to voting are
long-standing civil rights concerns in the United States. Barriers to voting
have taken many forms over the decades. A history of violent explicit
discouragement has shifted to more subtle access limitations that can include
long lines and wait times, long travel times to reach a polling station, and
other logistical barriers to voting. Our focus in this work is on quantifying
disparities in voting access pertaining to the overall time-to-vote, and how
they could be remedied via a better choice of polling location or provisioning
more sites where voters can cast ballots. However, appropriately calibrating
access disparities is difficult because of the need to account for factors such
as population density and different community expectations for reasonable
travel times.
  In this paper, we quantify access to polling locations, developing a
methodology for the calibrated measurement of racial disparities in polling
location ""load"" and distance to polling locations. We apply this methodology to
a study of real-world data from Florida and North Carolina to identify
disparities in voting access from the 2020 election. We also introduce
algorithms, with modifications to handle scale, that can reduce these
disparities by suggesting new polling locations from a given list of identified
public locations (including schools and libraries). Applying these algorithms
on the 2020 election location data also helps to expose and explore tradeoffs
between the cost of allocating more polling locations and the potential impact
on access disparities. The developed voting access measurement methodology and
algorithmic remediation technique is a first step in better polling location
assignment.",2205.14867v1,cs.CY,2022-05-30 06:13:19+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Mohsen Abbasi'), arxiv.Result.Author('Suresh Venkatasubramanian'), arxiv.Result.Author('Sorelle A. Friedler'), arxiv.Result.Author('Kristian Lum'), arxiv.Result.Author('Calvin Barrett')]",

Menu"" consisting of several prices. In equilibrium, the adversary can buy the
real ballots of any strict subset of districts at a price corresponding to the
willingness to sell on the part of the citizens holding such ballots. By
contrast, decoy voters are trapped into selling their ballots at a low, or even
negligible, price. Blowing up the adversary's budget by introducing decoy
ballots may thus turn out to be futile. The Devil's Menu can also be applied to
the well-known ""Lemons Problem"".",1712.05477v1,cs.GT,2017-12-14 23:54:58+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Hans Gersbach'), arxiv.Result.Author('Akaki Mamageishvili'), arxiv.Result.Author('Oriol Tejada')]",
18,Low-Cost Anti-Copying 2D Barcode by Exploiting Channel Noise Characteristics,"In this paper, for overcoming the drawbacks of the prior approaches, such as
low generality, high cost, and high overhead, we propose a Low-Cost
Anti-Copying (LCAC) 2D barcode by exploiting the difference between the noise
characteristics of legal and illegal channels. An embedding strategy is
proposed, and for a variant of it, we also make the corresponding analysis. For
accurately evaluating the performance of our approach, a theoretical model of
the noise in an illegal channel is established by using a generalized Gaussian
distribution. By comparing with the experimental results based on various
printers, scanners, and a mobile phone, it can be found that the sample
histogram and curve fitting of the theoretical model match well, so it can be
concluded that the theoretical model works well. For evaluating the security of
the proposed LCAC code, besides the direct-copying (DC) attack, the improved
version, which is the synthesized-copying (SC) attack, is also considered in
this paper. Based on the theoretical model, we build a prediction function to
optimize the parameters of our approach. The parameters optimization
incorporates the covertness requirement, the robustness requirement and a
tradeoff between the production cost and the cost of illegally-copying attacks
together. The experimental results show that the proposed LCAC code with two
printers and two scanners can detect the DC attack effectively and resist the
SC attack up to the access of 14 legal copies.",2001.06203v1,cs.CR,2020-01-17 09:09:45+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Ning Xie'), arxiv.Result.Author('Qiqi Zhang'), arxiv.Result.Author('Ji Hu'), arxiv.Result.Author('Gang Luo'), arxiv.Result.Author('Changsheng Chen')]",

22,OpenVoting: Making E2E-V voting transparent and recoverable,"End-to-end verifiable (E2E-V) voting systems have been around for some time.
However, their adoption in large elections is poor, seemingly because of the

preserved inviolate and then actually used to check the reported election
result in a trustworthy way that the public can verify. A full manual tally
from the VVPATs could be prohibitively expensive and time-consuming; moreover,
it is difficult for the public to determine whether a full hand count was
conducted accurately. We show how Risk-Limiting Audits (RLAs) could provide

ensures the integrity of the voter's real credential while enabling the
creation of fake credentials using interactive zero-knowledge proofs between
the voter as the verifier and the kiosk as the prover, unbeknownst to the
average voter. TRIP ensures that even voters who are under extreme coercion,
and cannot leave the booth with a real credential, can delegate their vote to a
political party, with the caveat that they must then trust the kiosk. TRIP
optimizes the tallying process by limiting the number of credentials a voter
can receive and capping the number of votes that a credential can cast per
election. We conduct a preliminary usability study among 41 participants at a

consistent with an audit trail (""ballots""), which can be paper or electronic.
SOBA combines three ideas: (1) publishing cast vote records (CVRs) separately
for each contest, so that anyone can verify that each reported contest outcome
is correct, if the CVRs reflect voters' intentions with sufficient accuracy;
(2) shrouding a mapping between ballots and the CVRs for those ballots to
prevent the loss of privacy that could occur otherwise; (3) assessing the
accuracy with which the CVRs reflect voters' intentions for a collection of
contests while simultaneously assessing the integrity of the shrouded mapping
between ballots and CVRs by comparing randomly selected ballots to the CVRs
that purport to represent them. Step (1) is related to work by the Humboldt
County Election Transparency Project, but publishing CVRs separately for
individual contests rather than images of entire ballots preserves privacy.
Step (2) requires a cryptographic commitment from elections officials.
Observers participate in step (3), which relies on the ""super-simple
simultaneous single-ballot risk-limiting audit."" Step (3) is designed to reveal
relatively few ballots if the shrouded mapping is proper and the CVRs
accurately reflect voter intent. But if the reported outcomes of the contests
differ from the outcomes that a full hand count would show, step (3) is
guaranteed to have a large chance of requiring all the ballots to be counted by
hand, thereby limiting the risk that an incorrect outcome will become official
and final.",1105.5803v2,stat.AP,2011-05-29 17:00:20+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Josh Benaloh'), arxiv.Result.Author('Douglas Jones'), arxiv.Result.Author('Eric Lazarus'), arxiv.Result.Author('Mark Lindeman'), arxiv.Result.Author('Philip B. Stark')]",
26,Phrase-Verified Voting: Verifiable Low-Tech Remote Boardroom Voting,"We present Phrase-Verified Voting, a voter-verifiable remote voting system
assembled from commercial off-the-shelf software for small private elections.
The system is transparent and enables each voter to verify that the tally
includes their ballot selection without requiring any understanding of
cryptography. This paper describes the system and its use in fall 2020, to vote
remotely in promotion committees in a university. Each voter fills out a form
in the cloud with their vote V (YES, NO, ABSTAIN) and a passphrase P-two words
entered by the voter. The system generates a verification prompt of the (P,V)
pairs and a tally of the votes, organized to help visualize how the votes add
up. After the polls close, each voter verifies that this table lists their
(P,V) pair and that the tally is computed correctly. The system is especially
appropriate for any small group making sensitive decisions. Because the system
would not prevent a coercer from demanding that their victim use a specified
passphrase, it is not designed for applications where such malfeasance would be
likely or go undetected. Results from 43 voters show that the system was
well-accepted, performed effectively for its intended purpose, and introduced
users to the concept of voter-verified elections. Compared to the commonly-used
alternatives of paper ballots or voting by email, voters found the system
easier to use, and that it provided greater privacy and outcome integrity.",2103.07180v1,cs.CR,2021-03-12 09:59:55+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Enka Blanchard'), arxiv.Result.Author('Ryan Robucci'), arxiv.Result.Author('Ted Selker'), arxiv.Result.Author('Alan Sherman')]",

this paper, we examine the security of electronic systems used in the process
of voting by mail, including online voter registration and online ballot
tracking systems. The goals of these systems, to facilitate voter registration
and increase public confidence in elections, are laudable. They indisputably
provide a critical public good. It is for these reasons that understanding the
security and privacy posture of the mail-in voting process is paramount. We
find that online voter registration systems in some states have vulnerabilities
that allow adversaries to alter or effectively prevent a voter's registration.
We additionally find that ballot tracking systems raise serious privacy
questions surrounding ease of access to voter data. While the vulnerabilities
discussed here are unlikely to enable an adversary to modify votes, several
could have the effect of disenfranchising voters and reducing voter confidence

29,Improved Metric Distortion for Deterministic Social Choice Rules,"In this paper, we study the metric distortion of deterministic social choice
rules that choose a winning candidate from a set of candidates based on voter
preferences. Voters and candidates are located in an underlying metric space. A
voter has cost equal to her distance to the winning candidate. Ordinal social
choice rules only have access to the ordinal preferences of the voters that are
assumed to be consistent with the metric distances. Our goal is to design an
ordinal social choice rule with minimum distortion, which is the worst-case
ratio, over all consistent metrics, between the social cost of the rule and
that of the optimal omniscient rule with knowledge of the underlying metric
space.
  The distortion of the best deterministic social choice rule was known to be
between $3$ and $5$. It had been conjectured that any rule that only looks at
the weighted tournament graph on the candidates cannot have distortion better
than $5$. In our paper, we disprove it by presenting a weighted tournament rule
with distortion of $4.236$. We design this rule by generalizing the classic
notion of uncovered sets, and further show that this class of rules cannot have
distortion better than $4.236$. We then propose a new voting rule, via an
alternative generalization of uncovered sets. We show that if a candidate
satisfying the criterion of this voting rule exists, then choosing such a
candidate yields a distortion bound of $3$, matching the lower bound. We
present a combinatorial conjecture that implies distortion of $3$, and verify
it for small numbers of candidates and voters by computer experiments. Using
our framework, we also show that selecting any candidate guarantees distortion
of at most $3$ when the weighted tournament graph is cyclically symmetric.",1905.01401v1,cs.GT,2019-05-04 01:14:44+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Kamesh Munagala'), arxiv.Result.Author('Kangning Wang')]",
30,Towards non-independence of modular additions in searching differential trails of ARX ciphers: new automatic methods with application to SPECK and Chaskey,"ARX-based ciphers, constructed by the modular addition, rotation and XOR
operations, have been receiving a lot of attention in the design of lightweight
symmetric ciphers. For their differential cryptanalysis, most automatic search
methods of differential trails adopt the assumption of independence of modulo
additions. However, this assumption does not necessarily hold when the trail
includes consecutive modular additions (CMAs). It has already been found that
in this case some differential trails searched by automatic methods before are
actually impossible, but the study is not in depth yet, for example, few effort
has been paid to exploiting the root causes of non-independence between CMAs
and accurate calculation of probabilities of the valid trails. In this paper,
we devote to solving these two problems. By examing the differential equations
of single and consecutive modular additions, we find that the influence of
non-independence can be described by relationships between constraints on the
intermediate state of two additions. Specifically, constraints of the first
addition can make some of its output bits non-uniform, and when they meet the
constraints of the second addition, the differential probability of the whole
CMA may be different from the value calculated under the independence
assumption. As a result, we can build SAT models to verify the validity of a
given differential trail of ARX ciphers and #SAT models to calculate the exact
probabilities of the differential propagation through CMAs in the trail,
promising a more accurate evaluation of probability of the trail. Our automic
methods and searching tools are applied to search related-key differential
trails of SPECK and Chaskey including CMAs in the key schedule and the round
function respectively.",2203.09741v1,cs.CR,2022-03-18 04:43:49+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Haiwen Qin'), arxiv.Result.Author('Baofeng Wu')]",

32,"D-DEMOS: A distributed, end-to-end verifiable, internet voting system","E-voting systems have emerged as a powerful technology for improving
democracy by reducing election cost, increasing voter participation, and even

internet voting systems have single points of failure, which may result in the
compromise of availability, voter secrecy, or integrity of the election
results. In this paper, we present the design, implementation, security

distributed, privacy-preserving and end-to-end verifiable. Our system includes
a fully asynchronous vote collection subsystem that provides immediate
assurance to the voter her vote was recorded as cast, without requiring
cryptographic operations on behalf of the voter. We also include a distributed,
replicated and fault-tolerant Bulletin Board component, that stores all
necessary election-related information, and allows any party to read and verify
the complete election process. Finally, we also incorporate trustees, i.e.,
individuals who control election result production while guaranteeing privacy

system is the first e-voting system whose voting operation is human verifiable,
i.e., a voter can vote over the web, even when her web client stack is
potentially unsafe, without sacrificing her privacy, and still be assured her
vote was recorded as cast. Additionally, a voter can outsource election
auditing to third parties, still without sacrificing privacy. Finally, as the
number of auditors increases, the probability of election fraud going

fertile ground for innovation and creativity. One of such disruptive innovation

challenging. Specifically, the counting must be implemented in a reproducible

combining Secure Multi-Party Computation (SMPC) and Distributed Ledger or

36,Towards end-to-end verifiable online voting: adding verifiability to established voting systems,"Online voting for independent elections is generally supported by trusted
election providers. Typically these providers do not offer any way in which a
voter can verify their vote, so the providers are trusted with ballot privacy
and ensuring correctness. Despite the desire to offer online voting for
political elections, this lack of transparency and verifiability is often seen
as a significant barrier to the large-scale adoption of online elections.
Adding verifiability to an online election increases transparency and
integrity, allowing voters to verify that their vote has been recorded
correctly and included in the tally. However, replacing existing online systems
with those that provide verifiable voting requires new algorithms and code to
be deployed, and this presents a significant business risk to commercial
election providers. In this paper we present the first step in an incremental
approach which minimises the business risk but demonstrates the advantages of
verifiability, by developing an implementation of key elements of a
Selene-based verifiability layer and adding it to an operational online voting
system. Selene is a verifiable voting protocol that uses trackers to enable
voters to confirm that their votes have been captured correctly while
protecting voter anonymity. This results in a system where even the election
authority running the system cannot change the result in an undetectable way,
and gives stronger guarantees on the integrity of the election than were
previously present. We explore the challenges presented by adding a
verifiability layer to an operational system. We describe the results of two
initial trials, which obtained that survey respondents found this form of
verifiability easy to use and that they broadly appreciated it. We conclude by
outlining the further steps in the road-map towards the deployment of a fully

37,Dispute Resolution in Voting,"In voting, disputes arise when a voter claims that the voting authority is
dishonest and did not correctly process his ballot while the authority claims
to have followed the protocol. A dispute can be resolved if any third party can
unambiguously determine who is right. We systematically characterize all
relevant disputes for a generic, practically relevant, class of voting
protocols. Based on our characterization, we propose a new definition of
dispute resolution for voting that accounts for the possibility that both
voters and the voting authority can make false claims and that voters may
abstain from voting.
  A central aspect of our work is timeliness: a voter should possess the
evidence required to resolve disputes no later than the election's end. We
characterize what assumptions are necessary and sufficient for timeliness in
terms of a communication topology for our voting protocol class. We formalize
the dispute resolution properties and communication topologies symbolically.
This provides the basis for verification of dispute resolution for a broad
class of protocols. To demonstrate the utility of our model, we analyze a
mixnet-based voting protocol and prove that it satisfies dispute resolution as
well as verifiability and receipt-freeness. To prove our claims, we combine
machine-checked proofs with traditional pen-and-paper proofs.",2005.03749v2,cs.CR,2020-05-07 20:51:24+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('David Basin'), arxiv.Result.Author('Sasa Radomirovic'), arxiv.Result.Author('Lara Schmid')]",

susceptibility of the voter's PC to various cyber-attacks. As a result, most
the research effort is put into developing protocols and machines for poll-site
electronic voting. Although these solutions yield promising results, they
cannot be directly adopted to Internet voting because of secure platform
problem. However, the cryptographic components they utilize may be very useful.
This paper presents a scheme based on combination of mixnets and homomorphic
encryption borrowed from robust poll-site voting, along with techniques
recommended for remote voting -- code sheets and test ballots. The protocol
tries to minimize the trust put in voter's PC by making the voter responsible
for manual encryption of his vote. To achieve this, the voter obtains a paper
ballot that allows him to scramble the vote by performing simple operations
(lookup in a table). Creation of paper ballots, as well as decryption of votes,
is performed by a group of cooperating trusted servers. As a result, the scheme
is characterized by strong asymmetry -- all computations are carried out on the
server side. In consequence it does not require any additional hardware on the
voter's side, and offers distributed trust, receipt-freeness and verifiability.",0804.2349v1,cs.CR,2008-04-15 10:26:40+00:00,[arxiv.Result.Author('Lukasz Nitschke')],
40,Power-Efficient Direct-Voting Assurance for Data Fusion in Wireless Sensor Networks,"Wireless sensor networks place sensors into an area to collect data and send
them back to a base station. Data fusion, which fuses the collected data before
they are sent to the base station, is usually implemented over the network.
Since the sensor is typically placed in locations accessible to malicious
attackers, information assurance of the data fusion process is very important.
A witness-based approach has been proposed to validate the fusion data. In this
approach, the base station receives the fusion data and ""votes"" on the data
from a randomly chosen sensor node. The vote comes from other sensor nodes,
called ""witnesses,"" to verify the correctness of the fusion data. Because the
base station obtains the vote through the chosen node, the chosen node could
forge the vote if it is compromised. Thus, the witness node must encrypt the
vote to prevent this forgery. Compared with the vote, the encryption requires
more bits, increasing transmission burden from the chosen node to the base
station. The chosen node consumes more power. This work improves the
witness-based approach using direct voting mechanism such that the proposed
scheme has better performance in terms of assurance, overhead, and delay. The
witness node transmits the vote directly to the base station. Forgery is not a
problem in this scheme. Moreover, fewer bits are necessary to represent the
vote, significantly reducing the power consumption. Performance analysis and
simulation results indicate that the proposed approach can achieve a 40 times
better overhead than the witness-based approach.",0705.3683v1,cs.CR,2007-05-25 02:56:47+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('H. -T. Pai'), arxiv.Result.Author('Y. S. Han')]",
41,Measuring and mitigating voting access disparities: a study of race and polling locations in Florida and North Carolina,"Voter suppression and associated racial disparities in access to voting are
long-standing civil rights concerns in the United States. Barriers to voting
have taken many forms over the decades. A history of violent explicit
discouragement has shifted to more subtle access limitations that can include
long lines and wait times, long travel times to reach a polling station, and
other logistical barriers to voting. Our focus in this work is on quantifying
disparities in voting access pertaining to the overall time-to-vote, and how
they could be remedied via a better choice of polling location or provisioning
more sites where voters can cast ballots. However, appropriately calibrating
access disparities is difficult because of the need to account for factors such
as population density and different community expectations for reasonable
travel times.
  In this paper, we quantify access to polling locations, developing a
methodology for the calibrated measurement of racial disparities in polling
location ""load"" and distance to polling locations. We apply this methodology to
a study of real-world data from Florida and North Carolina to identify
disparities in voting access from the 2020 election. We also introduce
algorithms, with modifications to handle scale, that can reduce these
disparities by suggesting new polling locations from a given list of identified
public locations (including schools and libraries). Applying these algorithms
on the 2020 election location data also helps to expose and explore tradeoffs
between the cost of allocating more polling locations and the potential impact
on access disparities. The developed voting access measurement methodology and
algorithmic remediation technique is a first step in better polling location

Moreover, scenarios such as committee or board elections require voting rules
that return multiple winners. In multi-winner approval voting (AV), an agent
may vote for as many candidates as they wish. Winners are chosen by tallying up
the votes and choosing the top-$k$ candidates receiving the most votes. An
agent may manipulate the vote to achieve a better outcome by voting in a way
that does not reflect their true preferences. In complex and uncertain
situations, agents may use heuristics to strategize, instead of incurring the
additional effort required to compute the manipulation which most favors them.
In this paper, we examine voting behavior in multi-winner approval voting
scenarios with complete information. We show that people generally manipulate
their vote to obtain a better outcome, but often do not identify the optimal
manipulation. Instead, voters tend to prioritize the candidates with the
highest utilities. Using simulations, we demonstrate the effectiveness of these
heuristics in situations where agents only have access to partial information.",1905.12104v2,cs.GT,2019-05-28 21:44:07+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Jaelle Scheuerman'), arxiv.Result.Author('Jason L. Harman'), arxiv.Result.Author('Nicholas Mattei'), arxiv.Result.Author('K. Brent Venable')]",

47,A Trustworthy Electronic Voting System for Australian Federal Elections,"The existing system for determining election results in Australia is, for the
most part, secure, accurate and understandable by the average voter. This
thesis explores the design of electronic voting systems designed to achieve
these same goals, while also improving on the existing system in the areas of
counting speed, accuracy, tamper resistance and accessibility.
  Electronic voting systems have seen limited use within Australian elections,
most prominently for State Elections in Victoria (2014), New South Wales (2015)
and Western Australia (2017), along with trials of electronic voting systems in
federal elections in 2007.
  This thesis presents an analysis of the iVote electronic voting system used
for the 2017 Western Australian State Election (iVote WA), outlining a number
of security risks introduced by the use of cloud-based distributed denial of
service mitigation. In addition, this thesis presents the results of a
cross-sectional survey of Australian voters regarding levels of trust for three
voting systems: the existing paper-based system used for Australian federal
elections, the iVote WA system, and the vVote system used for the 2014
Victorian State Election.
  The analysis of iVote, combined with the survey results, are used to inform a
recommendation for future research and public policy regarding the use of
electronic voting systems in Australian federal elections.",1805.02202v1,cs.CR,2018-05-06 12:41:10+00:00,[arxiv.Result.Author('Mark Eldridge')],
48,Testing for voter rigging in small polling stations,"Since the 1970s there has been a large number of countries that combine
formal democratic institutions with authoritarian practices. Although in such
countries the ruling elites may receive considerable voter support they often
employ several manipulation tools to control election outcomes. A common
practice of these regimes is the coercion and mobilization of a significant
amount of voters to guarantee the electoral victory. This electoral
irregularity is known as voter rigging, distinguishing it from vote rigging,
which involves ballot stuffing or stealing. Here we develop a statistical test
to quantify to which extent the results of a particular election display traces
of voter rigging. Our key hypothesis is that small polling stations are more
susceptible to voter rigging, because it is easier to identify opposing
individuals, there are less eye witnesses, and supposedly less visits from
election observers. We devise a general statistical method for testing whether
voting behavior in small polling stations is significantly different from the
behavior of their neighbor stations in a way that is consistent with the
widespread occurrence of voter rigging. Based on a comparative analysis, the
method enables to rule out whether observed differences in voting behavior
might be explained by geographic heterogeneities in vote preferences. We
analyze 21 elections in ten different countries and find significant anomalies
compatible with voter rigging in Russia from 2007-2011, in Venezuela from
2006-2013, and in Uganda 2011. Particularly disturbing is the case of Venezuela
where these distortions have been outcome-determinative in the 2013
presidential elections.",1604.07689v1,stat.AP,2016-04-26 14:29:08+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Raúl Jiménez'), arxiv.Result.Author('Manuel Hidalgo'), arxiv.Result.Author('Peter Klimek')]",
49,A Local-Dominance Theory of Voting Equilibria,"It is well known that no reasonable voting rule is strategyproof. Moreover,
the common Plurality rule is particularly prone to strategic behavior of the
voters and empirical studies show that people often vote strategically in
practice. Multiple game-theoretic models have been proposed to better
understand and predict such behavior and the outcomes it induces. However,
these models often make unrealistic assumptions regarding voters' behavior and
the information on which they base their vote.
  We suggest a new model for strategic voting that takes into account voters'
bounded rationality, as well as their limited access to reliable information.
We introduce a simple behavioral heuristic based on \emph{local dominance},
where each voter considers a set of possible world states without assigning
probabilities to them. This set is constructed based on prospective candidates'
scores (e.g., available from an inaccurate poll). In a \emph{voting
equilibrium}, all voters vote for candidates not dominated within the set of
possible states.
  We prove that these voting equilibria exist in the Plurality rule for a broad
class of local dominance relations (that is, different ways to decide which
states are possible). Furthermore, we show that in an iterative setting where
voters may repeatedly change their vote, local dominance-based dynamics quickly
converge to an equilibrium if voters start from the truthful state. Weaker
convergence guarantees in more general settings are also provided.
  Using extensive simulations of strategic voting on generated and real
preference profiles, we show that convergence is fast and robust, that emerging
equilibria are consistent across various starting conditions, and that they
replicate widely known patterns of human voting behavior such as Duverger's
law. Further, strategic voting generally improves the quality of the winner
compared to truthful voting.",1404.4688v2,cs.GT,2014-04-18 04:40:28+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Reshef Meir'), arxiv.Result.Author('Omer Lev'), arxiv.Result.Author('Jeffrey S. Rosenschein')]",
50,Optimized Distortion and Proportional Fairness in Voting,"A voting rule decides on a probability distribution over a set of $m$
alternatives, based on rankings of those alternatives provided by agents. We
assume that agents have cardinal utility functions over the alternatives, but
voting rules have access to only the rankings induced by these utilities. We
evaluate how well voting rules do on measures of social welfare and of
proportional fairness, computed based on the hidden utility functions.
  In particular, we study the distortion of voting rules, which is a worst-case
measure. It is an approximation ratio comparing the utilitarian social welfare
of the optimum outcome to the welfare of the outcome selected by the voting
rule, in the worst case over possible input profiles and utility functions that
are consistent with the input. The literature has studied distortion with
unit-sum utility functions, and left a small asymptotic gap in the best
possible distortion. Using tools from the theory of fair multi-winner
elections, we propose the first voting rule which achieves the optimal
distortion $\Theta(\sqrt{m})$ for unit-sum utilities. Our voting rule also
achieves optimum $\Theta(\sqrt{m})$ distortion for unit-range and approval
utilities.
  We then take a similar worst-case approach to a quantitative measure of the
fairness of a voting rule, called proportional fairness. Informally, it
measures whether the influence of cohesive groups of agents on the voting
outcome is proportional to the group size. We show that there is a voting rule
which, without knowledge of the utilities, can achieve an $O(\log
m)$-approximation to proportional fairness, the best possible approximation. As
a consequence of its proportional fairness, we show that this voting rule
achieves $O(\log m)$ distortion with respect to Nash welfare, and provides an
$O(\log m)$-approximation to the core, making it interesting for applications
in participatory budgeting.",2205.15760v2,cs.GT,2022-05-31 12:57:48+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Soroush Ebadian'), arxiv.Result.Author('Anson Kahng'), arxiv.Result.Author('Dominik Peters'), arxiv.Result.Author('Nisarg Shah')]",

of voting by mail, including online voter registration and online ballot
tracking systems. The goals of these systems, to facilitate voter registration
and increase public confidence in elections, are laudable. They indisputably
provide a critical public good. It is for these reasons that understanding the
security and privacy posture of the mail-in voting process is paramount. We
find that online voter registration systems in some states have vulnerabilities
that allow adversaries to alter or effectively prevent a voter's registration.
We additionally find that ballot tracking systems raise serious privacy
questions surrounding ease of access to voter data. While the vulnerabilities
discussed here are unlikely to enable an adversary to modify votes, several

such distributed elections, each voter has preferences over some set of
candidates, and each voter is assigned to exactly one site such that each site
is aware only of the voters assigned to it. The center is able to directly
communicate with all sites. We are interested in designing
communication-efficient protocols, allowing the center to maintain a candidate
which, with arbitrarily high probability, is guaranteed to be a winner, or at
least close to being a winner. We consider various single-winner voting rules,
such as variants of Approval voting and scoring rules, tournament-based voting
rules, and several round-based voting rules. For the voting rules we consider,
we show that, using communication which is logarithmic in the number of voters,
it is possible for the center to maintain such approximate winners; that is,
upon a query at any time the center can immediately return a candidate which is
guaranteed to be an approximate winner with high probability. We complement our
protocols with lower bounds. Our results are theoretical in nature and relate
to various scenarios, such as aggregating customer preferences in online
shopping websites or supermarket chains and collecting votes from different
polling stations of political elections.",1805.02206v2,cs.GT,2018-05-06 13:16:26+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Arnold Filtser'), arxiv.Result.Author('Nimrod Talmon')]",

remarkably high correlation between turnout and voting results; (ii) a large
number of polling stations where the UR/Putin results are given by a round
number of percent; (iii) constituencies showing improbably low or (iv)
anomalously high dispersion of results across polling stations; (v) substantial

""ensembling"", and the ""MLE approach to voting"", among other names. Past studies
typically assume that noisy votes are identically and independently distributed
(i.i.d.), but this assumption is often unrealistic. Instead, we assume that
votes are independent but not necessarily identically distributed and that our
ensembling algorithm has access to certain auxiliary information related to the
underlying model governing the noise in each vote. In our present work, we: (1)
define our problem and argue that it reflects common and socially relevant real
world scenarios, (2) propose a multi-arm bandit noise model and count-based
auxiliary information set, (3) derive maximum likelihood aggregation rules for
ranked and cardinal votes under our noise model, (4) propose, alternatively, to

and is heard by all base stations within the distance $r$. Both the users and
base stations are placed uniformly at random over the (unit) area. We first
consider a non-cooperative decoding where base stations work in isolation, but
a user is decoded as soon as one of its nearby base stations reads a clean
signal from it. We find the decoding probability and quantify the gains
introduced by multiple base stations. Specifically, the peak throughput
increases linearly with the number of base stations $m$ and is roughly $m/4$
larger than the throughput of a single-base station that uses standard slotted
Aloha. Next, we propose a cooperative decoding, where the mutually close base
stations inform each other whenever they decode a user inside their coverage
overlap. At each base station, the messages received from the nearby stations
help resolve collisions by the interference cancellation mechanism. Building
from our exact formulas for the non-cooperative case, we provide a heuristic
formula for the cooperative decoding probability that reflects well the actual
performance. Finally, we demonstrate by simulation significant gains of
cooperation with respect to the non-cooperative decoding.",1401.6799v1,cs.IT,2014-01-27 10:51:34+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Dragana Bajovic'), arxiv.Result.Author('Dusan Jakovetic'), arxiv.Result.Author('Dejan Vukobratovic'), arxiv.Result.Author('Vladimir Crnojevic')]",

state coercion of 'No' supporters to the controversial validity of unstamped
ballots. In this note we report the results of an election forensic analysis of
the 2017 referendum to clarify to what extent these voting irregularities were
present and if they were able to influence the outcome of the referendum. We
specifically apply novel statistical forensics tests to further identify the
specific nature of electoral malpractices. In particular, we test whether the
data contains fingerprints for ballot-stuffing (submission of multiple ballots
per person during the vote) and voter rigging (coercion and intimidation of
voters). Additionally, we perform tests to identify numerical anomalies in the
election results. We find systematic and highly significant support for the

signs for ballot-stuffing with an error (probability of ballot-stuffing not

often do not have access to the metric space $M$ and only see preference
rankings induced by $M$.Consequently, they often are incapable of selecting the
optimal candidate. The distortion of a voting rule measures the worst-case loss
of the quality being the result of having access only to preference rankings.
We extend the idea of distortion to approval-based preferences. First, we
compute the distortion of Approval Voting. Second, we introduce the concept of
acceptability-based distortion---the main idea behind is that the optimal
candidate is the one that is acceptable to most voters. We determine

moderation, i.e. suspension of a Twitter account in severe cases of platform

reversed as 'restored accounts'. In this paper, we release the firstever

properties and tweets of these restored accounts to get key insights into the
effects of suspension.We build a prediction model to classify an account into
normal, suspended or restored. We use SHAP values to interpret this model and

to explain individual predictions. We show that profile features like date of
account creation and the ratio of retweets to total tweets are more important
than content-based features like sentiment scores and Ekman emotion scores when
it comes to classification of an account as normal, suspended or restored. We
investigate restored accounts further in the pre-suspension and
post-restoration phases. We see that the number of tweets per account drop by
53.95% in the post-restoration phase, signifying less 'spammy' behaviour after
reversal of suspension. However, there was no substantial difference in the

take decisions and might cause lasting harm. Without a notion of

69,Predicting Popularity of Twitter Accounts through the Discovery of Link-Propagating Early Adopters,"In this paper, we propose a method of ranking recently created Twitter
accounts according to their prospective popularity. Early detection of new
promising accounts is useful for trend prediction, viral marketing, user
recommendation, and so on. New accounts are, however, difficult to evaluate
because they have not established their reputations, and we cannot apply
existing link-based or other popularity-based account evaluation methods. Our
method first finds ""early adopters"", i.e., users who often find new good
information sources earlier than others. Our method then regards new accounts
followed by good early adopters as promising, even if they do not have many
followers now. In order to find good early adopters, we estimate the frequency
of link propagation from each account, i.e., how many times the follow links
from the account have been copied by its followers. If its followers have
copied many of its follow links in the past, the account must be an early
adopter, who find good information sources earlier than its followers. We
develop a method of inferring which links are created by copying which links.
One advantage of our method is that our method only uses information that can
be easily obtained only by crawling neighbors of the target accounts in the
current Twitter graph. We evaluated our method by an experiment on Twitter
data. We chose then-new accounts from an old snapshot of Twitter, compute their
ranking by our method, and compare it with the number of followers the accounts
currently have. The result shows that our method produces better rankings than
various baseline methods, especially for new accounts that have only a few
followers.",1512.02341v1,cs.SI,2015-12-08 06:01:41+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Daichi Imamori'), arxiv.Result.Author('Keishi Tajima')]",
70,Mining Bad Credit Card Accounts from OLAP and OLTP,"Credit card companies classify accounts as a good or bad based on historical
data where a bad account may default on payments in the near future. If an
account is classified as a bad account, then further action can be taken to
investigate the actual nature of the account and take preventive actions. In
addition, marking an account as ""good"" when it is actually bad, could lead to
loss of revenue - and marking an account as ""bad"" when it is actually good,
could lead to loss of business. However, detecting bad credit card accounts in
real time from Online Transaction Processing (OLTP) data is challenging due to
the volume of data needed to be processed to compute the risk factor. We
propose an approach which precomputes and maintains the risk probability of an
account based on historical transactions data from offline data or data from a
data warehouse. Furthermore, using the most recent OLTP transactional data,
risk probability is calculated for the latest transaction and combined with the
previously computed risk probability from the data warehouse. If accumulated
risk probability crosses a predefined threshold, then the account is treated as
a bad account and is flagged for manual verification.",1807.00819v1,cs.DB,2018-07-02 14:24:10+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Sheikh Rabiul Islam'), arxiv.Result.Author('William Eberle'), arxiv.Result.Author('Sheikh Khaled Ghafoor')]","Islam, S. R., Eberle, W., & Ghafoor, S. K. (2017, May). Mining Bad

71,TROLLMAGNIFIER: Detecting State-Sponsored Troll Accounts on Reddit,"Growing evidence points to recurring influence campaigns on social media,
often sponsored by state actors aiming to manipulate public opinion on
sensitive political topics. Typically, campaigns are performed through
instrumented accounts, known as troll accounts; despite their prominence,
however, little work has been done to detect these accounts in the wild. In
this paper, we present TROLLMAGNIFIER, a detection system for troll accounts.
Our key observation, based on analysis of known Russian-sponsored troll
accounts identified by Reddit, is that they show loose coordination, often
interacting with each other to further specific narratives. Therefore, troll
accounts controlled by the same actor often show similarities that can be
leveraged for detection. TROLLMAGNIFIER learns the typical behavior of known
troll accounts and identifies more that behave similarly. We train
TROLLMAGNIFIER on a set of 335 known troll accounts and run it on a large
dataset of Reddit accounts. Our system identifies 1,248 potential troll
accounts; we then provide a multi-faceted analysis to corroborate the
correctness of our classification. In particular, 66% of the detected accounts
show signs of being instrumented by malicious actors (e.g., they were created
on the same exact day as a known troll, they have since been suspended by
Reddit, etc.). They also discuss similar topics as the known troll accounts and
exhibit temporal synchronization in their activity. Overall, we show that using
TROLLMAGNIFIER, one can grow the initial knowledge of potential trolls provided
by Reddit by over 300%.",2112.00443v1,cs.CR,2021-12-01 12:10:24+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Mohammad Hammas Saeed'), arxiv.Result.Author('Shiza Ali'), arxiv.Result.Author('Jeremy Blackburn'), arxiv.Result.Author('Emiliano De Cristofaro'), arxiv.Result.Author('Savvas Zannettou'), arxiv.Result.Author('Gianluca Stringhini')]",
72,Mining Anonymity: Identifying Sensitive Accounts on Twitter,"We explore the feasibility of automatically finding accounts that publish
sensitive content on Twitter. One natural approach to this problem is to first
create a list of sensitive keywords, and then identify Twitter accounts that
use these words in their tweets. But such an approach may overlook sensitive
accounts that are not covered by the subjective choice of keywords. In this
paper, we instead explore finding sensitive accounts by examining the
percentage of anonymous and identifiable followers the accounts have. This
approach is motivated by an earlier study showing that sensitive accounts
typically have a large percentage of anonymous followers and a small percentage
of identifiable followers.
  To this end, we first considered the problem of automatically determining if
a Twitter account is anonymous or identifiable. We find that simple techniques,
such as checking for name-list membership, perform poorly. We designed a
machine learning classifier that classifies accounts as anonymous or
identifiable. We then classified an account as sensitive based on the
percentages of anonymous and identifiable followers the account has. We applied
our approach to approximately 100,000 accounts with 404 million active
followers. The approach uncovered accounts that were sensitive for a diverse
number of reasons. These accounts span across varied themes, including those
that are not commonly proposed as sensitive or those that relate to socially
stigmatized topics. To validate our approach, we applied Latent Dirichlet
Allocation (LDA) topic analysis to the tweets in the detected sensitive and
non-sensitive accounts. LDA showed that the sensitive and non-sensitive
accounts obtained from the methodology are tweeting about distinctly different
topics. Our results show that it is indeed possible to objectively identify
sensitive accounts at the scale of Twitter.",1702.00164v1,cs.SI,2017-02-01 08:52:08+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Sai Teja Peddinti'), arxiv.Result.Author('Keith W. Ross'), arxiv.Result.Author('Justin Cappos')]",

common entities are found in the messages of two different accounts, the more
similar, in terms of content or interest, they tend to be. Towards this
direction, we introduce a methodology for discovering and suggesting similar
Twitter accounts, based entirely on their disseminated content in terms of
Twitter entities used. The methodology is based exclusively on semantic
representation protocols and related technologies. An ontological schema is
also described towards the semantification of the Twitter accounts and their

real-world enterprise organizations. We develop a novel forensic technique for
distinguishing between attacker activity and benign activity in compromised
enterprise accounts that yields few false positives and enables us to perform
fine-grained analysis of attacker behavior. Applying our methods to a set of
159 compromised enterprise accounts, we quantify the duration of time attackers
are active in accounts and examine thematic patterns in how attackers access
and leverage these hijacked accounts. We find that attackers frequently dwell
in accounts for multiple days to weeks, suggesting that delayed (non-real-time)
detection can still provide significant value. Based on an analysis of the
attackers' timing patterns, we observe two distinct modalities in how attackers
access compromised accounts, which could be explained by the existence of a
specialized market for hijacked enterprise accounts: where one class of
attackers focuses on compromising and selling account access to another class
of attackers who exploit the access such hijacked accounts provide. Ultimately,
our analysis sheds light on the state of enterprise account hijacking and
highlights fruitful directions for a broader space of detection methods,
ranging from new features that home in on malicious account behavior to the
development of non-real-time detection methods that leverage malicious activity
after an attack's initial point of compromise to more accurately identify

75,Pre-hijacked accounts: An Empirical Study of Security Failures in User Account Creation on the Web,"The ubiquity of user accounts in websites and online services makes account
hijacking a serious security concern. Although previous research has studied
various techniques through which an attacker can gain access to a victim's
account, relatively little attention has been directed towards the process of
account creation. The current trend towards federated authentication (e.g.,
Single Sign-On) adds an additional layer of complexity because many services
now support both the classic approach in which the user directly sets a
password, and the federated approach in which the user authenticates via an
identity provider.
  Inspired by previous work on preemptive account hijacking [Ghasemisharif et
al., USENIX SEC 2018], we show that there exists a whole class of account
pre-hijacking attacks. The distinctive feature of these attacks is that the
attacker performs some action before the victim creates an account, which makes
it trivial for the attacker to gain access after the victim has
created/recovered the account. Assuming a realistic attacker who knows only the
victim's email address, we identify and discuss five different types of account
pre-hijacking attacks.
  To ascertain the prevalence of such vulnerabilities in the wild, we analyzed
75 popular services and found that at least 35 of these were vulnerable to one
or more account pre-hijacking attacks. Whilst some of these may be noticed by
attentive users, others were completely undetectable from the victim's
perspective. Finally, we investigated the root cause of these vulnerabilities
and present a set of security requirements to prevent such vulnerabilities
arising in future.",2205.10174v1,cs.CR,2022-05-20 13:27:37+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Avinash Sudhodanan'), arxiv.Result.Author('Andrew Paverd')]",

eliminate traditional trust assumptions on parties and hold them accountable

recognize and react if this trust is violated. In this work, we discuss a
protocol agnostic definition of accountability: a protocol provides
accountability (w.r.t. some security property) if it can identify all
misbehaving parties, where misbehavior is defined as a deviation from the
protocol that causes a security violation. We provide a mechanized method for
the verification of accountability and demonstrate its use for verification and

exploits the already established trust of a compromised account, it is crucial
to detect these accounts to limit the damage they can cause. We propose a novel
general framework for semantic analysis of text messages coming out from an
account to detect compromised accounts. Our framework is built on the
observation that normal users will use language that is measurably different
from the language that an adversary would use when the account is compromised.
We propose to use the difference of language models of users and adversaries to
define novel interpretable semantic features for measuring semantic incoherence
in a message stream. We study the effectiveness of the proposed semantic
features using a Twitter data set. Evaluation results show that the proposed
framework is effective for discovering compromised accounts on social networks

78,Modern tontine with bequest: innovation in pooled annuity products,"We introduce a new pension product that offers retirees the opportunity for a
lifelong income and a bequest for their estate. Based on a tontine mechanism,
the product divides pension savings between a tontine account and a bequest
account. The tontine account is given up to a tontine pool upon death while the
bequest account value is paid to the retiree's estate. The values of these two
accounts are continuously re-balanced to the same proportion, which is the key
feature of our new product. Our main research question about the new product is
what proportion of pension savings should a retiree allocate to the tontine
account. Under a power utility function, we show that more risk averse retirees
allocate a fairly stable proportion of their pension savings to the tontine
account, regardless of the strength of their bequest motive. The proportion
declines as the retiree becomes less risk averse for a while. However, for the
least risk averse retirees, a high proportion of their pension savings is
optimally allocated to the tontine account. This surprising result is explained
by the least risk averse retirees seeking the potentially high value of the
bequest account at very old ages.",1903.05990v1,q-fin.PM,2019-03-14 13:37:23+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Thomas Bernhardt'), arxiv.Result.Author('Catherine Donnelly')]",Insurance: Mathematics and Economics 86 (2019) 168-188

the participants are economic agents, recent works highlighted the importance
of accountability: the ability to identify participants who provably violate
the protocol. At the same time, being able to reach consensus under dynamic
levels of participation is desirable for censorship resistance. We identify an
availability-accountability dilemma: in an environment with dynamic
participation, no protocol can simultaneously be accountably-safe and live. We
provide a resolution to this dilemma by constructing a provably secure
optimally-resilient accountability gadget to checkpoint a longest chain
protocol, such that the full ledger is live under dynamic participation and the
checkpointed prefix ledger is accountable. Our accountability gadget
construction is black-box and can use any BFT protocol which is accountable
under static participation. Using HotStuff as the black box, we implemented our
construction as a protocol for the Ethereum 2.0 beacon chain, and our
Internet-scale experiments with more than 4000 nodes show that the protocol

82,Making Code Voting Secure against Insider Threats using Unconditionally Secure MIX Schemes and Human PSMT Protocols,"Code voting was introduced by Chaum as a solution for using a possibly
infected-by-malware device to cast a vote in an electronic voting application.
Chaum's work on code voting assumed voting codes are physically delivered to
voters using the mail system, implicitly requiring to trust the mail system.
This is not necessarily a valid assumption to make - especially if the mail
system cannot be trusted. When conspiring with the recipient of the cast
ballots, privacy is broken.
  It is clear to the public that when it comes to privacy, computers and
""secure"" communication over the Internet cannot fully be trusted. This
emphasizes the importance of using: (1) Unconditional security for secure
network communication. (2) Reduce reliance on untrusted computers.
  In this paper we explore how to remove the mail system trust assumption in
code voting. We use PSMT protocols (SCN 2012) where with the help of visual
aids, humans can carry out $\mod 10$ addition correctly with a 99\% degree of
accuracy. We introduce an unconditionally secure MIX based on the combinatorics

strategic voting when there is uncertainty about the voting method. We
introduce three notions of manipulability for a set of voting methods: sure,
safe, and expected manipulability. With the help of a computer program, we
identify voting scenarios in which uncertainty about the voting method may
reduce or even eliminate a voter's incentive to misrepresent her preferences.
Thus, it may be in the interest of an election designer who wishes to reduce

the majority voting method is most stable to this random vote corruption, among
voting methods where each person has a small influence on the election. We
discuss some recent progress on the analogous result for elections between more
than two candidates. In this case, plurality should be most stable to
corruption in votes. We also survey results on adversarial election

86,Heuristics in Multi-Winner Approval Voting,"In many real world situations, collective decisions are made using voting.
Moreover, scenarios such as committee or board elections require voting rules
that return multiple winners. In multi-winner approval voting (AV), an agent
may vote for as many candidates as they wish. Winners are chosen by tallying up
the votes and choosing the top-$k$ candidates receiving the most votes. An
agent may manipulate the vote to achieve a better outcome by voting in a way
that does not reflect their true preferences. In complex and uncertain
situations, agents may use heuristics to strategize, instead of incurring the
additional effort required to compute the manipulation which most favors them.
In this paper, we examine voting behavior in multi-winner approval voting
scenarios with complete information. We show that people generally manipulate
their vote to obtain a better outcome, but often do not identify the optimal
manipulation. Instead, voters tend to prioritize the candidates with the
highest utilities. Using simulations, we demonstrate the effectiveness of these
heuristics in situations where agents only have access to partial information.",1905.12104v2,cs.GT,2019-05-28 21:44:07+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Jaelle Scheuerman'), arxiv.Result.Author('Jason L. Harman'), arxiv.Result.Author('Nicholas Mattei'), arxiv.Result.Author('K. Brent Venable')]",

control scenarios. To protect elections from such control attempts,
computational complexity has been used to show that electoral control, though

92,Designing Strategyproof Election Systems with Score Voting,"We focus on the strategyproofness of voting systems where voters must choose
a number of options among several possibilities. These systems include those
that are used for Participatory Budgeting, where we organize an election to
determine the allocation of a community's budget (city, region, etc.) dedicated
to the financing of projects.
  We present a model for studying voting mechanisms and the Constrained Change
Property (CCP), which will be used to design voting mechanisms that are always
strategyproof. We also define a new notion of social choice function and use it
to design a new class of utilitarian voting mechanisms that we call score
voting. We prove that the mechanisms designed with core voting with a neutral
score function are equivalent to knapsack voting on the same instance and that
any score voting designed with a total score function is strategyproof if and
only if its score function satisfies CCP.
  These results are combined to devise an algorithm that can find the closest
total score function that makes any given score voting to be strategyproof.",2210.02496v1,cs.GT,2022-10-05 18:19:52+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Johanne Cohen'), arxiv.Result.Author('Daniel Cordeiro'), arxiv.Result.Author('Valentin Dardilhac'), arxiv.Result.Author('Victor Glaser')]",

known that the current system, according to the Treaty of Nice, and the voting
system proposed in the Lisbon treaty both strongly deviate from the square root
law by Penrose. This is known to be the ideal voting rule under certain
assumptions. In 2004 Slomczynski and Zyczkowski designed a voting system, now
known as the Jagiellonian Compromise. It satisfies the square root law with
very high accuracy. Each member state in this system obtains a voting weight
proportional to the square root of the population. Additionally the quota is
fixed in such a way that the voting power of each country is also proportional
to the square root of the population.
  In this paper we investigate to which extent a change of the quota in the
Treaty of Nice and the Treaty of Lisbon may bring the voting power closer to
the ideal square root distribution. Our computations show that even with
optimal quota both systems are way off the ideal power distribution.",0812.4114v3,math.HO,2008-12-22 15:50:24+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Werner Kirsch'), arxiv.Result.Author('Jessica Langner')]",

106,Free Lunch! Retrospective Uplift Modeling for Dynamic Promotions Recommendation within ROI Constraints,"Promotions and discounts have become key components of modern e-commerce
platforms. For online travel platforms (OTPs), popular promotions include room
upgrades, free meals and transportation services. By offering these promotions,
customers can get more value for their money, while both the OTP and its travel
partners may grow their loyal customer base. However, the promotions usually
incur a cost that, if uncontrolled, can become unsustainable. Consequently, for
a promotion to be viable, its associated costs must be balanced by incremental
revenue within set financial constraints. Personalized treatment assignment can
be used to satisfy such constraints.
  This paper introduces a novel uplift modeling technique, relying on the
Knapsack Problem formulation, that dynamically optimizes the incremental
treatment outcome subject to the required Return on Investment (ROI)
constraints. The technique leverages Retrospective Estimation, a modeling
approach that relies solely on data from positive outcome examples. The method
also addresses training data bias, long term effects, and seasonality
challenges via online-dynamic calibration. This approach was tested via offline

transaction to perform processing or access objects at a remote site. Third,
unlike other environments, LOCUS allows replication of data objects at more
than one site in the network, and this capability is incorporated into the
transaction mechanism. If the copy of an object that is currently being

actions, but without chaining this set was static while with chaining it was

profiles of politicians attract markedly different interactions than other
categories. People tend to comment more, with longer comments, debating for
longer time, with a large number of replies, most of which are not explicitly
solicited. Moreover, comments tend to come from a small group of very active
users. Finally, we witness substantial differences when comparing profiles of
different parties.",1904.11719v2,cs.SI,2019-04-26 08:48:06+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Martino Trevisan'), arxiv.Result.Author('Luca Vassio'), arxiv.Result.Author('Idilio Drago'), arxiv.Result.Author('Marco Mellia'), arxiv.Result.Author('Fabricio Murai'), arxiv.Result.Author('Flavio Figueiredo'), arxiv.Result.Author('Ana Paula Couto da Silva'), arxiv.Result.Author('Jussara M.

118,Automatic Software Repair: a Bibliography,"This article presents a survey on automatic software repair. Automatic
software repair consists of automatically finding a solution to software bugs
without human intervention. This article considers all kinds of repairs. First,
it discusses behavioral repair where test suites, contracts, models, and
crashing inputs are taken as oracle. Second, it discusses state repair, also
known as runtime repair or runtime recovery, with techniques such as checkpoint
and restart, reconfiguration, and invariant restoration. The uniqueness of this
article is that it spans the research communities that contribute to this body
of knowledge: software engineering, dependability, operating systems,
programming languages, and security. It provides a novel and structured
overview of the diversity of bug oracles and repair operators used in the
literature.",1807.00515v1,cs.SE,2018-07-02 08:09:28+00:00,[arxiv.Result.Author('Martin Monperrus')],"ACM Computing Surveys, Association for Computing Machinery, 2017"
119,Easing the Conscience with OPC UA: An Internet-Wide Study on Insecure Deployments,"Due to increasing digitalization, formerly isolated industrial networks,
e.g., for factory and process automation, move closer and closer to the
Internet, mandating secure communication. However, securely setting up OPC UA,
the prime candidate for secure industrial communication, is challenging due to
a large variety of insecure options. To study whether Internet-facing OPC UA
appliances are configured securely, we actively scan the IPv4 address space for
publicly reachable OPC UA systems and assess the security of their
configurations. We observe problematic security configurations such as missing
access control (on 24% of hosts), disabled security functionality (24%), or use
of deprecated cryptographic primitives (25%) on in total 92% of the reachable
deployments. Furthermore, we discover several hundred devices in multiple
autonomous systems sharing the same security certificate, opening the door for
impersonation attacks. Overall, in this paper, we highlight commonly found
security misconfigurations and underline the importance of appropriate
configuration for security-featuring protocols.",2010.13539v1,cs.CR,2020-10-26 12:48:20+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Markus Dahlmanns'), arxiv.Result.Author('Johannes Lohmöller'), arxiv.Result.Author('Ina Berenice Fink'), arxiv.Result.Author('Jan Pennekamp'), arxiv.Result.Author('Klaus Wehrle'), arxiv.Result.Author('Martin Henze')]","In Proceedings of the ACM Internet Measurement Conference 2020
