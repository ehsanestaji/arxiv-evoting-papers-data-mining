0,Phase transition and power-law coarsening in Ising-doped voter model,"We examine an opinion formation model, which is a mixture of Voter and Ising
agents. Numerical simulations show that even a very small fraction ($\sim 1\%$)
of the Ising agents drastically changes the behaviour of the Voter model. The
Voter agents act as a medium, which correlates sparsely dispersed Ising agents,
and the resulting ferromagnetic ordering persists up to a certain temperature.
Upon addition of the Ising agents, a logarithmically slow coarsening of the
Voter model ($d=2$), or its active steady state ($d=3$), change into an
Ising-type power-law coarsening.",1706.03575v2,cond-mat.stat-mech,2017-06-12 11:38:48+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Adam Lipowski'), arxiv.Result.Author('Dorota Lipowska'), arxiv.Result.Author('Antonio L. Ferreira')]","Phys. Rev. E 96, 032145 (2017)"
1,The Voting Farm: A Distributed Class for Software Voting,"This document describes a class of C functions implementing a distributed
software voting mechanism for EPX or similar message passing multi-threaded
environments. Such a tool may be used for example, to set up a restoring organ,
i.e., an NMR (i.e., N-module redundant) system with N voters. In order to
describe the tool we start defining its basic building block, the voter. A
voter is defined as a software module connected to one user module and to a
farm of fellow voters arranged into a clique. By means of the functions in the
class the user module is able: to create a static ""picture"" of the voting farm,
needed for the set up of the clique; to instantiate the local voter; to send
input or control messages to that voter. No interlocutor is needed other than
the local voter. The other user modules are supposed to create coherent
pictures and instances of voters on other nodes of the machine and to manage
consistently the task of their local intermediary. All technicalities
concerning the set up of the clique and the exchange of messages between the
voters are completely transparent to the user module. In the following the
basic functionalities of the VotingFarm class will be discussed, namely how to
set up a ""passive farm"", or a non-alive topological representation of a
yet-to-be-activated voting farm; how to initiate the voting farm; how to
control the farm.",1610.02288v1,cs.DC,2016-02-27 21:11:27+00:00,[arxiv.Result.Author('Vincenzo De Florio')],
2,Proxy Voting for Better Outcomes,"We consider a social choice problem where only a small number of people out
of a large population are sufficiently available or motivated to vote. A common
solution to increase participation is to allow voters use a proxy, that is,
transfer their voting rights to another voter. Considering social choice
problems on metric spaces, we compare voting with and without the use of
proxies to see which mechanism better approximates the optimal outcome, and
characterize the regimes in which proxy voting is beneficial. When voters'
opinions are located on an interval, both the median mechanism and the mean
mechanism are substantially improved by proxy voting. When voters vote on many
binary issues, proxy voting is better when the sample of active voters is too
small to provide a good outcome. Our theoretical results extend to situations
where available voters choose strategically whether to participate. We support
our theoretical findings with empirical results showing substantial benefits of
proxy voting on simulated and real preference data.",1611.08308v1,cs.GT,2016-11-24 21:05:50+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Gal Cohensius'), arxiv.Result.Author('Shie Manor'), arxiv.Result.Author('Reshef Meir'), arxiv.Result.Author('Eli Meirom'), arxiv.Result.Author('Ariel Orda')]",
3,Phase transition in a coevolving network of conformist and contrarian voters,"In the coevolving voter model, each voter has one of two diametrically
opposite opinions, and a voter encountering a neighbor with the opposite
opinion may either adopt it or rewire the connection to another randomly chosen
voter sharing the same opinion. As we smoothly change the relative frequency of
rewiring compared to that of adoption, there occurs a phase transition between
an active phase and a frozen phase. By performing extensive Monte Carlo
calculations, we show that the phase transition is characterized by critical
exponents {\beta}=0.54(1) and {\nu} =1.5(1), which differ from the existing
mean-field-type prediction. We furthermore extend the model by introducing a
contrarian type that tries to have neighbors with the opposite opinion, and
show that the critical behavior still belongs to the same universality class
irrespective of such contrarians' fraction.",1301.4251v1,physics.soc-ph,2013-01-15 23:24:23+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Su Do Yi'), arxiv.Result.Author('Seung Ki Baek'), arxiv.Result.Author('Chen-Ping Zhu'), arxiv.Result.Author('Beom Jun Kim')]","Phys. Rev. E 87, 012806 (2013)"
4,Spontaneous symmetry breaking of active phase in coevolving nonlinear voter model,"We study an adaptive network model driven by a nonlinear voter dynamics. Each
node in the network represents a voter and can be in one of two states that
correspond to different opinions shared by the voters. A voter disagreeing with
its neighbor's opinion may either adopt it or rewire its link to another
randomly chosen voter with any opinion. The system is studied by means of the
pair approximation in which a distinction between the average degrees of nodes
in different states is made. This approach allows us to identify two
dynamically active phases, a symmetric and an asymmetric one. The asymmetric
active phase, in contrast to the symmetric, is characterized by different
numbers of nodes in the opposite states that coexist in the network. The pair
approximation predicts the possibility of spontaneous symmetry breaking, which
leads to a continuous phase transition between the symmetric and the asymmetric
active phases. In this case, the absorbing transition occurs between the
asymmetric active and the absorbing phases after the spontaneous symmetry
breaking. Discontinuous phase transitions and hysteresis loops between both
active phases are also possible. Interestingly, the asymmetric active phase is
not displayed by the model where the rewiring occurs only to voters sharing the
same opinion, studied by other authors. Our results are backed up by Monte
Carlo simulations.",2004.08927v3,physics.soc-ph,2020-04-19 18:14:25+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Arkadiusz Jędrzejewski'), arxiv.Result.Author('Joanna Toruniewska'), arxiv.Result.Author('Krzysztof Suchecki'), arxiv.Result.Author('Oleg Zaikin'), arxiv.Result.Author('Janusz A.

5,Fragmentation transitions in a coevolving nonlinear voter model,"We study a coevolving nonlinear voter model describing the coupled evolution
of the states of the nodes and the network topology. Nonlinearity of the
interaction is measured by a parameter q. The network topology changes by
rewiring links at a rate p. By analytical and numerical analysis we obtain a
phase diagram in p, q parameter space with three different phases: Dynamically
active coexistence phase in a single component network, absorbing consensus
phase in a single component network, and absorbing phase in a fragmented
network. For finite systems the active phase has a lifetime that grows
exponentially with system size, at variance with the similar phase for the
linear voter model that has a lifetime proportional to system size. We find
three transition lines that meet at the point of the fragmentation transition
of the linear voter model. A first transition line corresponds to a continuous
absorbing transition between the active and fragmented phases. The other two
transition lines are discontinuous transitions fundamentally different from the
transition of the linear voter model. One is a fragmentation transition between
the consensus and fragmented phases, and the other is an absorbing transition
in a single component network between the active and consensus phases.",1707.08111v2,physics.soc-ph,2017-07-24 20:41:42+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Byungjoon Min'), arxiv.Result.Author('Maxi San Miguel')]","Sci. Rep. 7, 12864 (2017)"
6,An adaptive voter model on simplicial complexes,"Collective decision making processes lie at the heart of many social,
political and economic challenges. The classical voter model is a
well-established conceptual model to study such processes. In this work, we
define a new form of adaptive (or co-evolutionary) voter model posed on a
simplicial complex, i.e., on a certain class of hypernetworks/hypergraphs. We
use the persuasion rule along edges of the classical voter model and the
recently studied re-wiring rule of edges towards like-minded nodes, and
introduce a new peer pressure rule applied to three nodes connected via a
2-simplex. This simplicial adaptive voter model is studied via numerical
simulation. We show that adding the effect of peer pressure to an adaptive
voter model leaves its fragmentation transition, i.e., the transition upon
varying the re-wiring rate from a single majority state into to a fragmented
state of two different opinion subgraphs, intact. Yet, above and below the
fragmentation transition, we observe that the peer pressure has substantial
quantitative effects. It accelerates the transition to a single-opinion state
below the transition and also speeds up the system dynamics towards
fragmentation above the transition. Furthermore, we quantify that there is a
multiscale hierarchy in the model leading to the depletion of 2-simplices,
before the depletion of active edges. This leads to the conjecture that many
other dynamic network models on simplicial complexes may show a similar
behaviour with respect to the sequential evolution of simplicies of different
dimensions.",1909.05812v1,nlin.AO,2019-09-12 17:13:22+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Leonhard Horstmeyer'), arxiv.Result.Author('Christian Kuehn')]","Phys. Rev. E 101, 022305 (2020)"

voters actively participate, and/or in the presence of sybil (fake or
duplicate) voters. Here we aim to address social choice in the presence of
sybils and voter abstention.
  To do so we assume the status-quo (Reality) as an ever-present distinguished
alternative, and study Reality Enforcing voting rules, which add virtual votes
in support of the status-quo. We measure the tradeoff between safety and
liveness (the ability of active honest voters to maintain/change the
status-quo, respectively) in a variety of domains, and show that the Reality
Enforcing voting rule is optimal in this respect.",2001.05271v2,cs.MA,2020-01-15 12:31:32+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Reshef Meir'), arxiv.Result.Author('Gal Shahaf'), arxiv.Result.Author('Ehud Shapiro'), arxiv.Result.Author('Nimrod Talmon')]",
8,Critical phenomena in presence of symmetric absorbing states: a microscopic spin model with tunable parameters,"The Langevin description of systems with two symmetric absorbing states
yields a phase diagram with three different phases (disordered and active,
ordered and active, absorbing) separated by critical lines belonging to three
different universality classes (generalized voter, Ising, and directed
percolation). In this paper we present a microscopic spin model with two
symmetric absorbing states that has the property that the model parameters can
be varied in a continuous way. Our results, obtained through extensive
numerical simulations, indicate that all features of the Langevin description
are encountered for our two-dimensionsal microscopic spin model. Thus the Ising
and direction percolation lines merge into a generalized voter critical line at
a point in parameter space that is not identical to the classical voter model.
A vast range of different quantities are used to determine the universality
classes of the order-disorder and absorbing phase transitions. The
investigation of time-dependent quantities at a critical point belonging to the
generalized voter universality class reveals a more complicated picture than
previously discussed in the literature.",2007.10933v1,cond-mat.stat-mech,2020-07-21 16:51:01+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Ahmadreza Azizi'), arxiv.Result.Author('Michel Pleimling')]","Phys. Rev. E 102, 022112 (2020)"
9,Generalized Voter-like model on activity driven networks with attractiveness,"We study the behavior of a generalized consensus dynamics on a temporal
network of interactions, the activity driven network with attractiveness. In
this temporal network model, agents are endowed with an intrinsic activity $a$,
ruling the rate at which they generate connections, and an intrinsic
attractiveness $b$, modulating the rate at which they receive connections. The
consensus dynamics considered is a mixed voter/Moran dynamics. Each agent,
either in state $0$ or $1$, modifies his/her state when connecting with a peer.
Thus, an active agent copies his/her state from the peer (with probability $p$)
or imposes his/her state to him/her (with the complementary probability $1-p$).
Applying a heterogeneous mean-field approach, we derive a differential equation
for the average density of voters with activity $a$ and attractiveness $b$ in
state $1$, that we use to evaluate the average time to reach consensus and the
exit probability, defined as the probability that a single agent with activity
$a$ and attractiveness $b$ eventually imposes his/her state to a pool of
initially unanimous population in the opposite state. We study a number of
particular cases, finding an excellent agreement with numerical simulations of
the model. Interestingly, we observe a symmetry between voter and Moran
dynamics in pure activity driven networks and their static integrated
counterparts that exemplifies the strong differences that a time-varying
network can impose on dynamical processes.",1804.07476v1,physics.soc-ph,2018-04-20 07:25:41+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Antoine Moinet'), arxiv.Result.Author('Alain Barrat'), arxiv.Result.Author('Romualdo Pastor Satorras')]","Phys. Rev. E 98, 022303 (2018)"
10,The Impact of Technologies in Political Campaigns,"Recent political campaigns have demonstrated how technologies are used to
boost election outcomes by microtargeting voters. We propose and analyze a
framework which analyzes how political activists use technologies to target
voters. Voters are represented as nodes of a network. Political activists reach
out locally to voters and try to convince them. Depending on their
technological advantage and budget, political activists target certain regions
in the network where their activities are able to generate the largest
vote-share gains. Analytically and numerically, we quantify vote-share gains
and savings in terms of budget and number of activists from employing superior
targeting technologies compared to traditional campaigns. Moreover, we
demonstrate that the technological precision must surpass a certain threshold
in order to lead to a vote-share gain or budget advantage. Finally, by
calibrating the technology parameters to the recent U.S. presidential election,
we show that a pure targeting technology advantage is consistent with Trump
winning against Clinton.",1909.07644v1,physics.soc-ph,2019-09-17 08:26:04+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Moritz Hoferer'), arxiv.Result.Author('Lucas Böttcher'), arxiv.Result.Author('Hans J.

11,The effect of quenched disorder in neutral theories,"We study systems with two symmetric absorbing states, such as the voter model
and variations of it, which have been broadly used as minimal neutral models in
genetics, population ecology, sociology, etc. We analyze the effects of a key
ingredient ineluctably present in most real applications: random-field-like
quenched disorder. In accord with simulations and previous findings,
coexistence between the two competing states/opinions turns out to be strongly
favored by disorder in the standard voter model; actually, a disorder-induced
phase transition is generated for any finite system size in the presence of an
arbitrary small spontaneous-inversion rate (preventing absorbing states from
being stable). For non-linear versions of the voter model a general theory (by
AlHammal et al.) explains that the spontaneous breaking of the up/down symmetry
and an absorbing state phase transition can occur either together or
separately, giving raise to two different scenarios. Here, we show that he
presence of quenched disorder in non-linear voter models does not allow the
separation of the up-down (Ising-like) symmetry breaking from the
active-to-absorbing phase transition in low-dimensional systems: both phenomena
can occur only simultaneously, as a consequence of the well-known Imry-Ma
argument generalized to these non-equilibrium problems. When the two phenomena
occur at unison, resulting into a genuinely non-equilibrium (""Generalized
Voter"") transition, the Imry-Ma argument is violated and the symmetry can be
spontaneously broken even in low dimensions.",1304.0965v1,cond-mat.stat-mech,2013-04-03 14:23:03+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Claudio Borile'), arxiv.Result.Author('Amos Maritan'), arxiv.Result.Author('Miguel A. Muñoz')]","Journal of Statistical Mechanics: Theory and Experiment 2013 (04),

12,How Twitter Data Sampling Biases U.S. Voter Behavior Characterizations,"Online social media are key platforms for the public to discuss political
issues. As a result, researchers have used data from these platforms to analyze
public opinions and forecast election results. Recent studies reveal the
existence of inauthentic actors such as malicious social bots and trolls,
suggesting that not every message is a genuine expression from a legitimate
user. However, the prevalence of inauthentic activities in social data streams
is still unclear, making it difficult to gauge biases of analyses based on such
data. In this paper, we aim to close this gap using Twitter data from the 2018
U.S. midterm elections. Hyperactive accounts are over-represented in volume
samples. We compare their characteristics with those of randomly sampled
accounts and self-identified voters using a fast and low-cost heuristic. We
show that hyperactive accounts are more likely to exhibit various suspicious
behaviors and share low-credibility information compared to likely voters.
Random accounts are more similar to likely voters, although they have slightly
higher chances to display suspicious behaviors. Our work provides insights into
biased voter characterizations when using online observations, underlining the
importance of accounting for inauthentic actors in studies of political issues
based on social media data.",2006.01447v1,cs.CY,2020-06-02 08:33:30+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Kai-Cheng Yang'), arxiv.Result.Author('Pik-Mai Hui'), arxiv.Result.Author('Filippo Menczer')]",
13,A Bi-level assessment of Twitter in predicting the results of an election: Delhi Assembly Elections 2020,"Elections are the backbone of any democratic country, where voters elect the
candidates as their representatives. The emergence of social networking sites
has provided a platform for political parties and their candidates to connect
with voters in order to spread their political ideas. Our study aims to use
Twitter in assessing the outcome of Delhi Assembly elections held in 2020,
using a bi-level approach, i.e., concerning political parties and their
candidates. We analyze the correlation of election results with the activities
of different candidates and parties on Twitter, and the response of voters on
them, especially the mentions and sentiment of voters towards a party. The
Twitter profiles of the candidates are compared both at the party level as well
as the candidate level to evaluate their association with the outcome of the
election. We observe that the number of followers and the replies to the tweets
of candidates are good indicators for predicting actual election outcome.
However, we observe that the number of tweets mentioning a party and the
sentiment of voters towards the party shown in tweets are not aligned with the
election result. We also use machine learning models on various features such
as linguistic, word embeddings and moral dimensions for predicting the election
result (win or lose). The random forest model using tweet features provides
promising results for predicting if the tweet belongs to a winning or losing
candidate.",2204.08746v2,cs.SI,2022-04-19 08:40:18+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Maneet Singh'), arxiv.Result.Author('S. R. S. Iyengar'), arxiv.Result.Author('Akrati Saxena'), arxiv.Result.Author('Rishemjit Kaur')]",

16,Mechanism of murine epidermal maintenance: Cell division and the Voter Model,"This paper presents an interesting experimental example of voter-model
statistics in biology. In recent work on mouse tail-skin, where proliferating
cells are confined to a two-dimensional layer, we showed that cells proliferate
and differentiate according to a simple stochastic model of cell division
involving just one type of proliferating cell that may divide both
symmetrically and asymmetrically. Curiously, these simple rules provide
excellent predictions of the cell population dynamics without having to address
their spatial distribution. Yet, if the spatial behaviour of cells is addressed
by allowing cells to diffuse at random, one deduces that density fluctuations
destroy tissue confluence, implying some hidden degree of spatial regulation in
the physical system. To infer the mechanism of spatial regulation, we consider
a two-dimensional model of cell fate that preserves the overall population
dynamics. By identifying the resulting behaviour with a three-species variation
of the ""Voter"" model, we predict that proliferating cells in the basal layer
should cluster. Analysis of empirical correlations of cells stained for
proliferation activity confirms that the expected clustering behaviour is
indeed seen in nature.",0712.0133v1,physics.bio-ph,2007-12-02 10:16:06+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Allon M. Klein'), arxiv.Result.Author('David P. Doupe'), arxiv.Result.Author('Philip H. Jones'), arxiv.Result.Author('Benjamin D. Simons')]",
17,Group Incentives and Rational Voting,"Our model describes competition between groups driven by the choices of
self-interested voters within groups. Within a Poisson voting environment,
parties observe aggregate support from groups and can allocate prizes or
punishments to them. In a tournament style analysis, the model characterizes
how contingent allocation of prizes based on relative levels of support affects
equilibrium voting behavior. In addition to standard notions of pivotality,
voters influence the distribution of prizes across groups. Such prize
pivotality supports positive voter turnout even in non-competitive electoral
settings. The analysis shows that competition for a prize awarded to the most
supportive group is only stable when two groups actively support a party.
However, competition among groups to avoid punishment is stable in environments
with any number of groups. We conclude by examining implications for endogenous
group formation and how politicians structure the allocation of rewards and
punishments.",1106.3102v4,math.PR,2011-06-15 21:20:50+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Alastair Smith'), arxiv.Result.Author('Bruce Bueno de Mesquita'), arxiv.Result.Author('Tom LaGatta')]","Journal of Theoretical Politics February 22, 2016 0951629816630439"

expected number of state-changes in a growing self-organizing process. With
this problem in mind, we examine two versions of the voter model on a
one-dimensional growing lattice. Our main result asserts that the expected
number of state-changes before an absorbing state is found can be controlled by
balancing the conservative and disruptive forces of growth. This is because
conservative growth preserves the self-organization of the voter model as it
searches for an absorbing state, whereas disruptive growth undermines this
self-organization. In particular, we focus on controlling the expected number
of state-changes as the rate of growth tends to zero or infinity in the limit.
These results illustrate how growth can affect the costs of self-organization
and so are pertinent to the physics of growing active matter.",2011.05780v2,physics.soc-ph,2020-10-21 18:33:20+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Robert J. H. Ross'), arxiv.Result.Author('Walter Fontana')]",
19,Multilayer coevolution dynamics of the nonlinear voter model,"We study a coevolving nonlinear voter model on a two-layer network.
Coevolution stands for coupled dynamics of the state of the nodes and of the
topology of the network in each layer. The plasticity parameter p measures the
relative time scale of the evolution of the states of the nodes and the
evolution of the network by link rewiring. Nonlinearity of the interactions is
taken into account through a parameter q that describes the nonlinear effect of
local majorities, being q = 1 the marginal situation of the ordinary voter
model. Finally the connection between the two layers is measured by a degree of
multiplexing `. In terms of these three parameters, p, q and ` we find a rich
phase diagram with different phases and transitions. When the two layers have
the same plasticity p, the fragmentation transition observed in a single layer
is shifted to larger values of p plasticity, so that multiplexing avoids
fragmentation. Different plasticities for the two layers lead to new phases
that do not exist in a coevolving nonlinear voter model in a single layer,
namely an asymmetric fragmented phase for q > 1 and an active shattered phase
for q < 1. Coupling layers with dfferent types of nonlinearity, q1 < 1 and q2 >
1, we can find two different transitions by increasing the plasticity
parameter, a first absorbing transition with no fragmentation and a subsequent
fragmentation transition.",1811.12136v1,nlin.AO,2018-11-29 13:39:35+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Byungjoon Min'), arxiv.Result.Author('Maxi San Miguel')]","New J. Phys. 21, 035004 (2019)"

multiplex them to produce the correct output according to $C_{in}$. For any
radix, the carry output has always a logical value 0 or 1. We show that using 0

Conventional Quantum Plain (CQP) adder. The QCLA adder is an extension of
conventional digital Carry Look-Ahead adder. Compared with the CQP adder, two
main advantages are as follows: First, the proposed MQP and QCLA adders have
less number of elementary gates than the CQP adder. Secondly, the number of
processing stages of the MQP and QCLA adder are less than ones of the CQP
adder. As a result, the throughput time for computing the sum of two numbers on

that none of the mentioned arithmetic units require a complete ternary full
adder. Instead, they can be designed by use of partial ternary full adder,

29,Area/latency optimized early output asynchronous full adders and relative-timed ripple carry adders,"This article presents two area/latency optimized gate level asynchronous full
adder designs which correspond to early output logic. The proposed full adders
are constructed using the delay-insensitive dual-rail code and adhere to the
four-phase return-to-zero handshaking. For an asynchronous ripple carry adder
(RCA) constructed using the proposed early output full adders, the
relative-timing assumption becomes necessary and the inherent advantages of the
relative-timed RCA are: (1) computation with valid inputs, i.e., forward
latency is data-dependent, and (2) computation with spacer inputs involves a
bare minimum constant reverse latency of just one full adder delay, thus
resulting in the optimal cycle time. With respect to different 32-bit RCA
implementations, and in comparison with the optimized strong-indication,
weak-indication, and early output full adder designs, one of the proposed early
output full adders achieves respective reductions in latency by 67.8, 12.3 and
6.1 %, while the other proposed early output full adder achieves corresponding
reductions in area by 32.6, 24.6 and 6.9 %, with practically no power penalty.
Further, the proposed early output full adders based asynchronous RCAs enable
minimum reductions in cycle time by 83.4, 15, and 8.8 % when considering
carry-propagation over the entire RCA width of 32-bits, and maximum reductions
in cycle time by 97.5, 27.4, and 22.4 % for the consideration of a typical
carry chain length of 4 full adder stages, when compared to the least of the
cycle time estimates of various strong-indication, weak-indication, and early
output asynchronous RCAs of similar size. All the asynchronous full adders and
RCAs were realized using standard cells in a semi-custom design fashion based
on a 32/28 nm CMOS process technology.",1604.04006v1,cs.AR,2016-04-14 01:01:41+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('P Balasubramanian'), arxiv.Result.Author('S Yamashita')]","SpringerPlus, vol. 5:440, pages 26, April 2016"

internal carries, which is independent of the RCA size. The forward latency of
the proposed hybrid input encoded full adder based RCA is data-dependent while
its reverse latency is the least equaling the propagation delay of just one
full adder. Compared to the best of the existing hybrid input encoded full
adders based 32-bit RCAs, the proposed early output hybrid input encoded full
adder based 32-bit RCA enables respective reductions in forward latency and

classical adder is needed for operation of a digital computer. We model the
quantum full adder as a realistic complex algorithm on a large number of qubits
in an Ising-spin quantum computer. Our results are an important step toward
effective modeling of the quantum modular adder which is needed for Shor's and
other quantum algorithms. Our full adder has the following features: (i) The
near-resonant transitions with small detunings are completely suppressed, which
allows us to decrease errors by several orders of magnitude and to model a
1000-qubit full adder. (We add a 1000-bit number using 2001 spins.) (ii) We
construct the full adder gates directly as sequences of radio-frequency pulses,
rather than breaking them down into generalized logical gates, such as
Control-Not and one qubit gates. This substantially reduces the number of
pulses needed to implement the full adder. [The maximum number of pulses
required to add one bit (F-gate) is 15]. (iii) Full adder is realized in a
homogeneous spin chain. (iv) The phase error is minimized: the F-gates generate
approximately the same phase for different states of the superposition. (v)
Modeling of the full adder is performed using quantum maps instead of
differential equations. This allows us to reduce the calculation time to a
reasonable value.",quant-ph/0403085v1,quant-ph,2004-03-10 18:21:00+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('D. I. Kamenev'), arxiv.Result.Author('G. P. Berman'), arxiv.Result.Author('R. B. Kassman'), arxiv.Result.Author('V. I. Tsifrinovich')]",

conditions, compared to existing automated approaches. The first is a
substantial expansion of the class of protocols and threat models that can be
automatically analysed: we can systematically deal with (a) honest authorities
present in different phases, (b) threat models in which no dishonest voters
occur, and (c) protocols whose ballot secrecy depends on fresh data coming from
other phases. The second advantage is that it can significantly improve
verification efficiency, as the individual conditions are often simpler to
verify. E.g., for the LEE protocol, we obtain a speedup of over two orders of
magnitude. We show the scope and effectiveness of our approach using ProVerif

61,Limiting Risk by Turning Manifest Phantoms into Evil Zombies,"Drawing a random sample of ballots to conduct a risk-limiting audit generally
requires knowing how the ballots cast in an election are organized into groups,
for instance, how many containers of ballots there are in all and how many
ballots are in each container. A list of the ballot group identifiers along
with number of ballots in each group is called a ballot manifest. What if the
ballot manifest is not accurate? Surprisingly, even if ballots are known to be
missing from the manifest, it is not necessary to make worst-case assumptions
about those ballots--for instance, to adjust the margin by the number of
missing ballots--to ensure that the audit remains conservative. Rather, it
suffices to make worst-case assumptions about the individual randomly selected
ballots that the audit cannot find. This observation provides a simple
modification to some risk-limiting audit procedures that makes them
automatically become more conservative if the ballot manifest has errors. The
modification--phantoms to evil zombies (~2EZ)--requires only an upper bound on
the total number of ballots cast. ~2EZ makes the audit P-value stochastically
larger than it would be had the manifest been accurate, automatically requiring
more than enough ballots to be audited to offset the manifest errors. This
ensures that the true risk limit remains smaller than the nominal risk limit.
On the other hand, if the manifest is in fact accurate and the upper bound on
the total number of ballots equals the total according to the manifest, ~2EZ
has no effect at all on the number of ballots audited nor on the true risk
limit.",1207.3413v1,stat.AP,2012-07-14 11:26:02+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Jorge H. Banuelos'), arxiv.Result.Author('Philip B. Stark')]",

changes from the slate they used to vote. Overall accuracy was exceptionally
high. Participants saw 1440 total contests, and of those 1440, there were a
total of 4 errors, so total accuracy was 99.8%. Participants were able to
perform with near-perfect accuracy regardless of ballot length, ballot type,
number of altered races, and location of altered races. Detection performance
was extremely robust. We conclude that with proper direction and resources,
voters can be near-perfect detectors of ballot changes on printed paper ballots

a ballot tiling, we establish formulae which are analogues of formulae for Dyck
tilings. Especially, the generating functions have factorized expressions. The
key tool is a planted plane tree and its increasing labellings. We also
introduce a generalized perfect matching which is bijective to an Hermite

expressions of a generating function of ballot tilings with a fixed lower path.",1705.06434v1,math-ph,2017-05-18 06:46:09+00:00,[arxiv.Result.Author('Keiichi Shigechi')],

indistinguishable from real ballots. By means of a game-theoretical model, we
show that decoy ballots may not provide effective protection against a
malevolent adversary trying to buy real ballots. If the citizenry is divided
into subgroups (or districts), the adversary can construct a so-called ""Devil's
Menu"" consisting of several prices. In equilibrium, the adversary can buy the
real ballots of any strict subset of districts at a price corresponding to the
willingness to sell on the part of the citizens holding such ballots. By
contrast, decoy voters are trapped into selling their ballots at a low, or even
negligible, price. Blowing up the adversary's budget by introducing decoy
ballots may thus turn out to be futile. The Devil's Menu can also be applied to
the well-known ""Lemons Problem"".",1712.05477v1,cs.GT,2017-12-14 23:54:58+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Hans Gersbach'), arxiv.Result.Author('Akaki Mamageishvili'), arxiv.Result.Author('Oriol Tejada')]",
66,The ATHENA Class of Risk-Limiting Ballot Polling Audits,"The main risk-limiting ballot polling audit in use today, BRAVO, is designed
for use when single ballots are drawn at random and a decision regarding
whether to stop the audit or draw another ballot is taken after each ballot
draw (ballot-by-ballot (B2) audits). On the other hand, real ballot polling
audits draw many ballots in a single round before determining whether to stop
(round-by-round (R2) audits). We show that BRAVO results in significant
inefficiency when directly applied to real R2 audits. We present the ATHENA
class of R2 stopping rules, which we show are risk-limiting if the round
schedule is pre-determined (before the audit begins). We prove that each rule
is at least as efficient as the corresponding BRAVO stopping rule applied at
the end of the round. We have open-source software libraries implementing most
of our results.
  We show that ATHENA halves the number of ballots required, for all state
margins in the 2016 US Presidential election and a first round with $90\%$
stopping probability, when compared to BRAVO (stopping rule applied at the end
of the round). We present simulation results supporting the 90% stopping
probability claims and our claims for the risk accrued in the first round.
Further, ATHENA reduces the number of ballots by more than a quarter for low
margins, when compared to the BRAVO stopping rule applied on ballots in
selection order. This implies that keeping track of the order when drawing
ballots R2 is not beneficial, because ATHENA is more efficient even without
information on selection order. These results are significant because current
approaches to real ballot polling election audits use the B2 BRAVO rules,
requiring about twice as much work on the part of election officials. Applying
the rules in selection order requires fewer ballots, but keeping track of the
order, and entering it into audit software, adds to the effort.",2008.02315v5,cs.CR,2020-08-05 18:47:37+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Filip Zagórski'), arxiv.Result.Author('Grant McClearn'), arxiv.Result.Author('Sarah Morin'), arxiv.Result.Author('Neal McBurnett'), arxiv.Result.Author('Poorvi L.

""risk-limiting"" properties. Our framework is general and can compensate for
counting mistakes made during audits.
  Moreover, we present and analyze a simple approximate sampling
method,""$k$-cut"", for picking a ballot randomly from a stack, without counting.
Our method involves doing $k$ ""cuts"", each involving moving a random portion of
ballots from the top to the bottom of the stack, and then picking the ballot on
top. Unlike conventional methods of picking a ballot at random, $k$-cut does
not require identification numbers on the ballots or counting many ballots per
draw. We analyze how close the distribution of chosen ballots is to the uniform
distribution, and design different mitigation procedures. We show that $k=6$
cuts is enough for an risk-limiting election audit, based on empirical data,

it does not require a ballot manifest; (2) it can be conducted independently at
different locations, rather than requiring a central authority to select the
sample from the whole population of cast ballots or requiring stratified
sampling; (3) it can start in polling places on election night, before margins
are known. If the reported margins for the 2016 U.S. Presidential election are
correct, a Bernoulli ballot-polling audit with a risk limit of 5% and a
sampling rate of $p_0 = 1\%$ would have had at least a 99% probability of
confirming the outcome in 42 states. (The other states were more likely to have
needed to examine additional ballots.) Logistical and security advantages that
auditing in the polling place affords may outweigh the cost of examining more

trees for symmetric Dyck tilings: symmetric Dyck tiling strip (symDTS) and
symmetric Dyck tiling ribbon (symDTR). We give two definitions of Hermite
histories for symmetric Dyck tilings, and show that they are equivalent by use
of the correspondence between symDTS operation and an Hermite history. Since
ballot tilings form a subset in the set of symmetric Dyck tilings, we construct
an inclusive map from labeled trees for ballot tilings to labeled trees for
symmetric Dyck tilings. By this inclusive map, the results for symmetric Dyck
tilings can be applied to those of ballot tilings. We introduce and study the
notions of ballot tableaux and tree-like tableaux of shifted shapes, which are

70,SOBA: Secrecy-preserving Observable Ballot-level Audit,"SOBA is an approach to election verification that provides observers with
justifiably high confidence that the reported results of an election are
consistent with an audit trail (""ballots""), which can be paper or electronic.
SOBA combines three ideas: (1) publishing cast vote records (CVRs) separately
for each contest, so that anyone can verify that each reported contest outcome
is correct, if the CVRs reflect voters' intentions with sufficient accuracy;
(2) shrouding a mapping between ballots and the CVRs for those ballots to
prevent the loss of privacy that could occur otherwise; (3) assessing the
accuracy with which the CVRs reflect voters' intentions for a collection of
contests while simultaneously assessing the integrity of the shrouded mapping
between ballots and CVRs by comparing randomly selected ballots to the CVRs
that purport to represent them. Step (1) is related to work by the Humboldt
County Election Transparency Project, but publishing CVRs separately for
individual contests rather than images of entire ballots preserves privacy.
Step (2) requires a cryptographic commitment from elections officials.
Observers participate in step (3), which relies on the ""super-simple
simultaneous single-ballot risk-limiting audit."" Step (3) is designed to reveal
relatively few ballots if the shrouded mapping is proper and the CVRs
accurately reflect voter intent. But if the reported outcomes of the contests
differ from the outcomes that a full hand count would show, step (3) is

71,"Voter Verification of BMD Ballots Is a Two-Part Question: Can They? Mostly, They Can. Do They? Mostly, They Don't","The question of whether or not voters actually verify ballots produced by
ballot marking devices (BMDs) is presently the subject of some controversy.
Recent studies (e.g., Bernhard, et al. 2020) suggest the verification rate is
low. What is not clear from previous research is whether this is more a result
of voters being unable to do so accurately or whether this is because voters
simply choose not to attempt verification in the first place. In order to
understand this problem, we conducted an experiment in which 108 participants
participated in a mock election where the BMD displayed the voters' true
choices, but then changed a subset of those choices on the printed ballot. The
design of the printed ballot, the length of the ballot, the number of changes
that were made to the ballot, the location of those changes, and the
instructions provided to the voters were manipulated as part of the experiment.
Results indicated that of those voters who chose to examine the printed ballot,
76% detected anomalies, indicating that voters can reliably detect errors on
their ballot if they will simply review it. This suggests that administrative
remedies, rather than attempts to alter fundamental human perceptual
capabilities, could be employed to encourage voters to check their ballots,

incorrect election results, independent of why the result was incorrect.
Ballot-polling audits select ballots at random and interpret those ballots as
evidence for and against the reported result, continuing this process until
either they support the recorded result, or they fall back to a full manual
recount. For elections with digitised scanning and counting of ballots, a
comparison audit compares randomly selected digital ballots with their paper
versions. Discrepancies are referred to as errors, and are used to build
evidence against or in support of the recorded result. Risk-limiting audits for
first-past-the-post elections are well understood, and used in some US
elections. We define a number of approaches to ballot-polling and comparison
risk-limiting audits for Instant Runoff Voting (IRV) elections. We show that

looking at only a small fraction of the total ballots (assuming no errors were

traditional plurality voting in which voters submit rankings over the
candidates rather than single votes. In practice, elections using IRV often
restrict the ballot length, the number of candidates a voter is allowed to rank
on their ballot. We theoretically and empirically analyze how ballot length can
influence the outcome of an election, given fixed voter preferences. We show
that there exist preference profiles over $k$ candidates such that up to $k-1$
different candidates win at different ballot lengths. We derive exact lower
bounds on the number of voters required for such profiles and provide a
construction matching the lower bound for unrestricted voter preferences.
Additionally, we characterize which sequences of winners are possible over
ballot lengths and provide explicit profile constructions achieving any
feasible winner sequence. We also examine how classic preference restrictions
influence our results--for instance, single-peakedness makes $k-1$ different
winners impossible but still allows at least $\Omega(\sqrt k)$. Finally, we
analyze a collection of 168 real-world elections, where we truncate rankings to
simulate shorter ballots. We find that shorter ballots could have changed the
outcome in one quarter of these elections. Our results highlight ballot length

tokenized voting rights gained prominence within Decentralized Finance (DeFi).
Voting rights tokens (aka. governance tokens) are fungible tokens that grant
individual holders the right to vote upon the fate of a project. The motivation
behind these tokens is to achieve decentral control. Because the initial
allocations of these tokens is often un-democratic, the DeFi project Yearn
Finance experimented with a fair launch allocation where no tokens are
pre-mined and all participants have an equal opportunity to receive them.
Regardless, research on voting rights tokens highlights the formation of
oligarchies over time. The hypothesis is that the tokens' tradability is the
cause of concentration. To examine this proposition, this paper uses an
Agent-based Model to simulate and analyze the concentration of voting rights
tokens post fair launch under different trading modalities. It serves to
examine three distinct token allocation scenarios considered as fair. The
results show that regardless of the allocation, concentration persistently
occurs. It confirms the hypothesis that the disease is endogenous: the cause of
concentration is the tokens tradablility. The findings inform theoretical
understandings and practical implications for on-chain governance mediated by
tokens.",2208.10271v1,cs.CR,2022-08-15 09:30:21+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Joaquin Delgado Fernandez'), arxiv.Result.Author('Tom Barbereau'), arxiv.Result.Author('Orestis Papageorgiou')]",

88,Multi-Winner Voting with Approval Preferences,"Multi-winner voting is the process of selecting a fixed-size set of
representative candidates based on voters' preferences. It occurs in
applications ranging from politics (parliamentary elections) to the design of
modern computer applications (collaborative filtering, dynamic Q&A platforms,
diversifying search results). All these applications share the problem of
identifying a representative subset of alternatives -- and the study of
multi-winner voting is the principled analysis of this task.
  This book provides a thorough and in-depth look at multi-winner voting based
on approval preferences. One speaks of approval preferences if voters express
their preferences by providing a set of candidates they approve. Approval
preferences thus separate candidates in approved and disapproved ones, a
simple, binary classification. The corresponding multi-winner voting rules are
called approval-based committee (ABC) rules. Due to the simplicity of approval
preferences, ABC rules are widely suitable for practical use.
  Recent years have seen a rising interest in ABC voting. While multi-winner
voting has been originally a topic studied by economists and political
scientists, a significant share of recent progress has occurred in the field of
computational social choice. This discipline is situated in the intersection of
artificial intelligence, computer science, economics, and (to a lesser degree)
political science, combining insights and methods from these distinct fields.
The goal of this book is to present fundamental concepts and results for ABC

89,Go Beyond Point Pairs: A General and Accurate Sim2Real Object Pose Voting Method with Efficient Online Synthetic Training,"Object pose estimation is an important topic in 3D vision. Though most
current state-of-the-art method that trains on real-world pose annotations
achieve good results, the cost of such real-world training data is too high. In
this paper, we propose a novel method for sim-to-real pose estimation, which is
effective on both instance-level and category-level settings. The proposed
method is based on the point-pair voting scheme from CPPF to vote for object
centers, orientations, and scales. Unlike naive point pairs, to enrich the
context provided by each voting unit, we introduce N-point tuples to fuse
features from more than two points. Besides, a novel vote selection module is
leveraged in order to discard those `bad' votes. Experiments show that our
proposed method greatly advances the performance on both instance-level and
category-level scenarios. Our method further narrows the gap between
sim-to-real and real-training methods by generating synthetic training data
online efficiently, while all previous sim-to-real methods need to generate
data offline, because of their complex background synthesizing or
photo-realistic rendering. Code repository:

90,SLV: Spatial Likelihood Voting for Weakly Supervised Object Detection,"Based on the framework of multiple instance learning (MIL), tremendous works
have promoted the advances of weakly supervised object detection (WSOD).
However, most MIL-based methods tend to localize instances to their
discriminative parts instead of the whole content. In this paper, we propose a
spatial likelihood voting (SLV) module to converge the proposal localizing
process without any bounding box annotations. Specifically, all region
proposals in a given image play the role of voters every iteration during
training, voting for the likelihood of each category in spatial dimensions.
After dilating alignment on the area with large likelihood values, the voting
results are regularized as bounding boxes, being used for the final
classification and localization. Based on SLV, we further propose an end-to-end
training framework for multi-task learning. The classification and localization
tasks promote each other, which further improves the detection performance.
Extensive experiments on the PASCAL VOC 2007 and 2012 datasets demonstrate the
superior performance of SLV.",2006.12884v1,cs.CV,2020-06-23 10:24:13+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Ze Chen'), arxiv.Result.Author('Zhihang Fu'), arxiv.Result.Author('Rongxin Jiang'), arxiv.Result.Author('Yaowu Chen'), arxiv.Result.Author('Xian-sheng Hua')]",

a party are systematically higher than average. A quantitative definition of a
stronghold by means of persistence in time of fluctuations in the voting
spatial distribution is introduced, and results from the US Presidential

compare electoral results with simulations obtained with the SIRM model finding

dynamics through the votes in the Eurovision song contest, which are decided by
a crowd-based scheme in which viewers vote through mobile phone messages.
Taking into account asymmetries and imperfect perception of culture, we measure
cultural relations among European countries in terms of cultural affinity. We
propose the Friend-or-Foe coefficient, a metric to measure voting biases among
participants of a Eurovision contest. We validate how this metric represents
cultural affinity through its relation with known cultural distances, and
through numerical analysis of biased Eurovision contests. We apply this metric
to the historical set of Eurovision contests from 1975 to 2012, finding new
patterns of stronger modularity than using votes alone. Furthermore, we define
a measure of polarization that, when applied to empirical data, shows a sharp
increase within EU countries during 2010 and 2011. We empirically validate the
relation between this polarization and economic indicators in the EU, showing
how political decisions influence both the economy and the way citizens relate

be estimated from data and bounded in terms of familiar quantities. We further
extend our theory by leveraging the principle of Voted Risk Minimization (VRM)

new learning bounds for this advanced setting, which we use to design two new

Only LCC and box scales are regressed, while box orientations are generated by

98,"Inducing Interpretable Voting Classifiers without Trading Accuracy for Simplicity: Theoretical Results, Approximation Algorithms","Recent advances in the study of voting classification algorithms have brought
empirical and theoretical results clearly showing the discrimination power of
ensemble classifiers. It has been previously argued that the search of this
classification power in the design of the algorithms has marginalized the need
to obtain interpretable classifiers. Therefore, the question of whether one
might have to dispense with interpretability in order to keep classification
strength is being raised in a growing number of machine learning or data mining
papers. The purpose of this paper is to study both theoretically and
empirically the problem. First, we provide numerous results giving insight into
the hardness of the simplicity-accuracy tradeoff for voting classifiers. Then
we provide an efficient ""top-down and prune"" induction heuristic, WIDC, mainly
derived from recent results on the weak learning and boosting frameworks. It is
to our knowledge the first attempt to build a voting classifier as a base
formula using the weak learning framework (the one which was previously highly
successful for decision tree induction), and not the strong learning framework
(as usual for such classifiers with boosting-like approaches). While it uses a
well-known induction scheme previously successful in other classes of concept
representations, thus making it easy to implement and compare, WIDC also relies
on recent or new results we give about particular cases of boosting known as
partition boosting and ranking loss boosting. Experimental results on
thirty-one domains, most of which readily available, tend to display the
ability of WIDC to produce small, accurate, and interpretable decision

designed to predict the voting behavior of the Supreme Court of the United
States. Using the extremely randomized tree method first proposed in Geurts, et
al. (2006), a method similar to the random forest approach developed in Breiman
(2001), as well as novel feature engineering, we predict more than sixty years
of decisions by the Supreme Court of the United States (1953-2013). Using only
data available prior to the date of decision, our model correctly identifies
69.7% of the Court's overall affirm and reverse decisions and correctly
forecasts 70.9% of the votes of individual justices across 7,700 cases and more
than 68,000 justice votes. Our performance is consistent with the general level
of prediction offered by prior scholars. However, our model is distinctive as
it is the first robust, generalized, and fully predictive model of Supreme
Court voting behavior offered to date. Our model predicts six decades of
behavior of thirty Justices appointed by thirteen Presidents. With a more sound
methodological foundation, our results represent a major advance for the

and light-weight to be deployed in large scale online elections. By taking
advantage of proxy re-encryption, our protocol can defend vote-buying attacks.
Furthermore, we introduce a new property, candidate-adaptiveness, in electronic
voting which refers to as every candidate knows the real-time vote number

of a large population are sufficiently available or motivated to vote. A common
solution to increase participation is to allow voters use a proxy, that is,
transfer their voting rights to another voter. Considering social choice
problems on metric spaces, we compare voting with and without the use of
proxies to see which mechanism better approximates the optimal outcome, and
characterize the regimes in which proxy voting is beneficial. When voters'
opinions are located on an interval, both the median mechanism and the mean
mechanism are substantially improved by proxy voting. When voters vote on many
binary issues, proxy voting is better when the sample of active voters is too
small to provide a good outcome. Our theoretical results extend to situations
where available voters choose strategically whether to participate. We support
our theoretical findings with empirical results showing substantial benefits of
proxy voting on simulated and real preference data.",1611.08308v1,cs.GT,2016-11-24 21:05:50+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Gal Cohensius'), arxiv.Result.Author('Shie Manor'), arxiv.Result.Author('Reshef Meir'), arxiv.Result.Author('Eli Meirom'), arxiv.Result.Author('Ariel Orda')]",

networks to promote and find content has grown, both on the side of content
producers (viral marketing) and consumers (recommendation). Here we study the
role of social networks in promoting content on Digg, a social news aggregator
that allows users to submit links to and vote on news stories. Digg's goal is
to feature the most interesting stories on its front page, and it aggregates
opinions of its many users to identify them. Like other social networking
sites, Digg allows users to designate other users as ``friends'' and see what
stories they found interesting. We studied the spread of interest in news
stories submitted to Digg in June 2006. Our results suggest that pattern of the
spread of interest in a story on the network is indicative of how popular the
story will become. Stories that spread mainly outside of the submitter's
neighborhood go on to be very popular, while stories that spread mainly through
submitter's social neighborhood prove not to be very popular. This effect is
visible already in the early stages of voting, and one can make a prediction
about the potential audience of a story simply by analyzing where the initial
votes come from.",0806.1918v1,cs.CY,2008-06-11 17:53:45+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Kristina Lerman'), arxiv.Result.Author('Aram Galstyan')]",

that is $\theta$-representative, which entails that for any voter located
anywhere on the line, its favorite candidate is within a distance $\theta$ of
the favorite candidate of its closest proxy. This property guarantees a strong
form of representation as the set of voters is not required to be fixed in
advance, or even be finite. We show that for candidates located on a line, an
optimal proxy arrangement can be computed in polynomial time. Moreover, we
provide upper and lower bounds on the number of proxies required to form a
$\theta$-representative set, thus showing that a relatively small number of
proxies is enough to capture the preferences of any set of voters. An
additional beneficial property of a $\theta$-representative proxy arrangement

The goal of our work is to build on existing solutions to achieve scalability
without losing privacy guarantees and verifiability. We present SBvote, a
blockchain-based self-tallying voting protocol that is scalable in the number
of voters and therefore suitable for large-scale elections. The evaluation of

108,Enhancing Engagement in Token-Curated Registries via an Inflationary Mechanism,"Token Curated Registries (TCR) are decentralized recommendation systems that
can be implemented using Blockchain smart contracts. They allow participants to
vote for or against adding items to a list through a process that involves
staking tokens intrinsic to the registry, with winners receiving the staked
tokens for each vote. A TCR aims to provide incentives to create a well-curated
list. In this work, we consider a challenge for these systems - incentivizing
token-holders to actually engage and participate in the voting process. We
propose a novel token-inflation mechanism for enhancing engagement, whereby
only voting participants see their token supply increased by a pre-defined
multiple after each round of voting. To evaluate this proposal, we propose a
simple 4-class model of voters that captures all possible combinations of two
key dimensions: whether they are engaged (likely to vote at all for a given
item) or disengaged, and whether they are informed (likely to vote in a way
that increases the quality of the list) or uninformed, and a simple metric to
evaluate the quality of the list as a function of the vote outcomes. We conduct
simulations using this model of voters and show that implementing
token-inflation results in greater wealth accumulation for engaged voters. In
particular, when the number of informed voters is sufficiently high, our
simulations show that voters that are both informed and engaged see the
greatest benefits from participating in the registry when our proposed
token-inflation mechanism is employed. We further validate this finding using a
simplified mathematical analysis.",1811.09680v1,cs.GT,2018-11-23 20:51:13+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Yi Lucy Wang'), arxiv.Result.Author('Bhaskar Krishnamachari')]",
109,Measuring Violations of Positive Involvement in Voting,"In the context of computational social choice, we study voting methods that
assign a set of winners to each profile of voter preferences. A voting method
satisfies the property of positive involvement (PI) if for any election in
which a candidate x would be among the winners, adding another voter to the
election who ranks x first does not cause x to lose. Surprisingly, a number of
standard voting methods violate this natural property. In this paper, we
investigate different ways of measuring the extent to which a voting method
violates PI, using computer simulations. We consider the probability (under
different probability models for preferences) of PI violations in randomly
drawn profiles vs. profile-coalition pairs (involving coalitions of different
sizes). We argue that in order to choose between a voting method that satisfies
PI and one that does not, we should consider the probability of PI violation
conditional on the voting methods choosing different winners. We should also
relativize the probability of PI violation to what we call voter potency, the
probability that a voter causes a candidate to lose. Although absolute
frequencies of PI violations may be low, after this conditioning and
relativization, we see that under certain voting methods that violate PI, much
of a voter's potency is turned against them - in particular, against their
desire to see their favorite candidate elected.",2106.11502v1,cs.GT,2021-06-22 02:46:37+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Wesley H. Holliday'), arxiv.Result.Author('Eric Pacuit')]","EPTCS 335, 2021, pp. 189-209"

111,Latent Space Modeling of Multidimensional Networks with Application to the Exchange of Votes in Eurovision Song Contest,"The Eurovision Song Contest is a popular TV singing competition held annually
among country members of the European Broadcasting Union. In this competition,
each member can be both contestant and jury, as it can participate with a song
and/or vote for other countries' tunes. Throughout the years, the voting system
has repeatedly been accused of being biased by the presence of tactical voting,
according to which votes would represent strategic interests rather than actual
musical preferences of the voting countries. In this work, we develop a latent
space model to investigate the presence of a latent structure underlying the
exchange of votes. Focusing on the period from 1998 to 2015, we represent the
vote exchange as a multivariate network: each edition is a network, where
countries are the nodes and two countries are linked by an edge if one voted
for the other. The different networks are taken to be independent replicates of
a common latent space capturing the overall relationships among the countries.
Proximity denotes similarity, and countries close in the latent space are
assumed to be more likely to exchange votes. Therefore, if the exchange of
votes depends on the similarity between countries, the quality of the competing
songs might not be a relevant factor in the determination of the voting
preferences, and this would suggest the presence of bias. A Bayesian
hierarchical modelling approach is employed to model the probability of a
connection between any two countries as a function of their distance in the
latent space, and of network-specific parameters and edge-specific covariates.

112,A practical multi-party computation algorithm for a secure distributed online voting system,"We present an online voting architecture based on partitioning the election
in small clusters of voters and using a new Multi-party Computation algorithm
for obtaining voting results from the clusters. This new algorithm has some
practical advantages over other previously known algorithms and isn't bound to
any specific cryptographic concept; so it can be adapted to future
cryptographic exigencies. Compared with other online voting technologies, we
see that this new architecture is less vulnerable to hacker attacks and attacks
from dishonest authorities, given that no sensitive information is stored in
any public server and there is no need for any trustee to safeguard the
legality of the election process. Even in case of an attack succeeding, the
risks associated with the overall election are far lower than with any other
voting system. This architecture can also be combined with any other voting
system, inheriting advantages from both systems.",1603.04228v1,cs.CR,2016-03-14 12:10:47+00:00,[arxiv.Result.Author('Juanjo Bermúdez')],
113,VoteAgain: A scalable coercion-resistant voting system,"The strongest threat model for voting systems considers coercion resistance:
protection against coercers that force voters to modify their votes, or to
abstain. Existing remote voting systems either do not provide this property;
require an expensive tallying phase; or burden users with the need to store
cryptographic key material and with the responsibility to deceive their
coercers. We propose VoteAgain, a scalable voting scheme that relies on the
revoting paradigm to provide coercion resistance. VoteAgain uses a novel
deterministic ballot padding mechanism to ensure that coercers cannot see
whether a vote has been replaced. This mechanism ensures tallies take
quasilinear time, making VoteAgain the first revoting scheme that can handle
elections with millions of voters. We prove that VoteAgain provides ballot
privacy, coercion resistance, and verifiability; and we demonstrate its
scalability using a prototype implementation of all cryptographic primitives.",2005.11189v3,cs.CR,2020-05-22 13:51:34+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Wouter Lueks'), arxiv.Result.Author('Iñigo Querejeta-Azurmendi'), arxiv.Result.Author('Carmela Troncoso')]",

voting rules such as Proportional Approval Voting (PAV) and Phragm\'en's rules
have been shown to produce committees that are proportional, in the sense that
they proportionally represent voters' preferences; all of these rules are
strategically manipulable by voters. On the other hand, a generalisation of
Approval Voting gives a non-proportional but strategyproof voting rule. We show
that there is a fundamental tradeoff between these two properties: we prove
that no multiwinner voting rule can simultaneously satisfy a weak form of
proportionality (a weakening of justified representation) and a weak form of
strategyproofness. Our impossibility is obtained using a formulation of the
problem in propositional logic and applying SAT solvers; a human-readable
version of the computer-generated proof is obtained by extracting a minimal
unsatisfiable set (MUS). We also discuss several related axiomatic questions in

117,Exact Scale Invariance in Mixing of Binary Candidates in Voting Model,"We introduce a voting model and discuss the scale invariance in the mixing of
candidates. The Candidates are classified into two categories $\mu\in \{0,1\}$
and are called as `binary' candidates. There are in total $N=N_{0}+N_{1}$
candidates, and voters vote for them one by one. The probability that a
candidate gets a vote is proportional to the number of votes. The initial
number of votes (`seed') of a candidate $\mu$ is set to be $s_{\mu}$. After
infinite counts of voting, the probability function of the share of votes of
the candidate $\mu$ obeys gamma distributions with the shape exponent $s_{\mu}$
in the thermodynamic limit $Z_{0}=N_{1}s_{1}+N_{0}s_{0}\to \infty$. Between the
cumulative functions $\{x_{\mu}\}$ of binary candidates, the power-law relation
$1-x_{1} \sim (1-x_{0})^{\alpha}$ with the critical exponent
$\alpha=s_{1}/s_{0}$ holds in the region $1-x_{0},1-x_{1}<<1$. In the double
scaling limit $(s_{1},s_{0})\to (0,0)$ and $Z_{0} \to \infty$ with
$s_{1}/s_{0}=\alpha$ fixed, the relation $1-x_{1}=(1-x_{0})^{\alpha}$ holds

118,Always on Voting: A Framework for Repetitive Voting on the Blockchain,"Elections are commonly repeated over longer and fixed time intervals, ranging
from months to years. This results in limitations on governance since elected
candidates or policies are difficult to remove before the next election even
though they might be deemed detrimental to the majority of participants. When
new information is available, participants may decide (through a public
deliberation) to make amendments to their choice but have no opportunity to
change their vote before the next elections. Another issue is the peak-end
effect, where voters' judgment is based on how they felt a short time before
the elections instead of judging the whole period of the governance. Finally,
there exist a few issues related to centralized e-voting, such as censorship
and tampering with the results and data. To address these issues, we propose
Always on Voting (AoV) -- a repetitive blockchain-based voting framework that
allows participants to continuously vote and change elected candidates or
policies without having to wait for the next election. Participants are
permitted to privately change their vote at any point in time, while the effect
of their change is manifested at the end of each epoch, whose duration is
shorter than the time between two main elections. To thwart the peak-end effect
issue in epochs, the ends of epochs are randomized and made unpredictable.
While several blockchain-based e-voting proposals had been already presented,
to the best of our knowledge, none of them addressed the issue of re-voting and
peak-end effect.",2107.10571v3,cs.CR,2021-07-22 10:49:48+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Sarad Venugopalan'), arxiv.Result.Author('Ivana Stančíková'), arxiv.Result.Author('Ivan Homoliak')]",

world and the premier source for information on films. Like Wikipedia, much of
IMDb's information is user contributed. IMDb also allows users to voice their
opinion on the quality of films through voting. We investigate whether there is
a connection between this user voting data and certain economic film
characteristics. To this end, we perform distribution and correlation analysis
on a set of films chosen to mitigate effects of bias due to the language and
country of origin of films. We show that production budget, box office gross,
and total number of user votes for films are consistent with double-log normal
distributions for certain time periods. Both total gross and user votes are
consistent with a double-log normal distribution from the late 1980s onward,
while for budget, it extends from 1935 to 1979. In addition, we find a strong
correlation between number of user votes and the economic statistics,
particularly budget. Remarkably, we find no evidence for a correlation between
number of votes and average user rating. As previous studies have found a
strong correlation between production budget and marketing expenses, our
results suggest that total user votes is an indicator of a film's prominence or

remote online voting into large scale elections. With a policy of carrot and
stick, it will encourage voters to deviate from honest voting strategy and
spoil the democratic election. To deal with this problem, many voting protocols
proposed their solutions with the notion of receipt-freeness. However, existing
receipt-free voting protocols either rely on some impractical assumptions as
untappable communication channel, or are burden with heavy voter-side
computation and quadratic tallying complexity. In this paper, we present
$Laoco\ddot{o}n$, a brand new cryptographic voting protocol which is practical
and light-weight to be deployed in large scale online elections. By taking
advantage of proxy re-encryption, our protocol can defend vote-buying attacks.
Furthermore, we introduce a new property, candidate-adaptiveness, in electronic
voting which refers to as every candidate knows the real-time vote number
towards himself, while he knows nothing about others, nor he buys votes. We
prove the correctness of our protocol and evaluate the performance with

that is $\theta$-representative, which entails that for any voter located
anywhere on the line, its favorite candidate is within a distance $\theta$ of
the favorite candidate of its closest proxy. This property guarantees a strong
form of representation as the set of voters is not required to be fixed in
advance, or even be finite. We show that for candidates located on a line, an
optimal proxy arrangement can be computed in polynomial time. Moreover, we
provide upper and lower bounds on the number of proxies required to form a
$\theta$-representative set, thus showing that a relatively small number of
proxies is enough to capture the preferences of any set of voters. An
additional beneficial property of a $\theta$-representative proxy arrangement
is that for strict-Condorcet voting rules, the outcome of proxy voting is
similarly close to the outcome of direct voting.",2012.06747v1,cs.GT,2020-12-12 07:17:01+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Elliot Anshelevich'), arxiv.Result.Author('Zack Fitzsimmons'), arxiv.Result.Author('Rohit Vaish'), arxiv.Result.Author('Lirong Xia')]",

blockchain-based self-tallying voting protocol that is scalable in the number

126,Agent-based Model of Initial Token Allocations: Evaluating Wealth Concentration in Fair Launches,"With advancements in distributed ledger technologies and smart contracts,
tokenized voting rights gained prominence within Decentralized Finance (DeFi).
Voting rights tokens (aka. governance tokens) are fungible tokens that grant
individual holders the right to vote upon the fate of a project. The motivation
behind these tokens is to achieve decentral control. Because the initial
allocations of these tokens is often un-democratic, the DeFi project Yearn
Finance experimented with a fair launch allocation where no tokens are
pre-mined and all participants have an equal opportunity to receive them.
Regardless, research on voting rights tokens highlights the formation of
oligarchies over time. The hypothesis is that the tokens' tradability is the
cause of concentration. To examine this proposition, this paper uses an
Agent-based Model to simulate and analyze the concentration of voting rights
tokens post fair launch under different trading modalities. It serves to
examine three distinct token allocation scenarios considered as fair. The
results show that regardless of the allocation, concentration persistently
occurs. It confirms the hypothesis that the disease is endogenous: the cause of
concentration is the tokens tradablility. The findings inform theoretical
understandings and practical implications for on-chain governance mediated by
tokens.",2208.10271v1,cs.CR,2022-08-15 09:30:21+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Joaquin Delgado Fernandez'), arxiv.Result.Author('Tom Barbereau'), arxiv.Result.Author('Orestis Papageorgiou')]",

128,Multi-Winner Voting with Approval Preferences,"Multi-winner voting is the process of selecting a fixed-size set of
representative candidates based on voters' preferences. It occurs in
applications ranging from politics (parliamentary elections) to the design of
modern computer applications (collaborative filtering, dynamic Q&A platforms,
diversifying search results). All these applications share the problem of
identifying a representative subset of alternatives -- and the study of
multi-winner voting is the principled analysis of this task.
  This book provides a thorough and in-depth look at multi-winner voting based
on approval preferences. One speaks of approval preferences if voters express
their preferences by providing a set of candidates they approve. Approval
preferences thus separate candidates in approved and disapproved ones, a
simple, binary classification. The corresponding multi-winner voting rules are
called approval-based committee (ABC) rules. Due to the simplicity of approval
preferences, ABC rules are widely suitable for practical use.
  Recent years have seen a rising interest in ABC voting. While multi-winner
voting has been originally a topic studied by economists and political
scientists, a significant share of recent progress has occurred in the field of
computational social choice. This discipline is situated in the intersection of
artificial intelligence, computer science, economics, and (to a lesser degree)
political science, combining insights and methods from these distinct fields.

current state-of-the-art method that trains on real-world pose annotations

this paper, we propose a novel method for sim-to-real pose estimation, which is
effective on both instance-level and category-level settings. The proposed
method is based on the point-pair voting scheme from CPPF to vote for object
centers, orientations, and scales. Unlike naive point pairs, to enrich the
context provided by each voting unit, we introduce N-point tuples to fuse
features from more than two points. Besides, a novel vote selection module is
leveraged in order to discard those `bad' votes. Experiments show that our
proposed method greatly advances the performance on both instance-level and
category-level scenarios. Our method further narrows the gap between
sim-to-real and real-training methods by generating synthetic training data

proposals in a given image play the role of voters every iteration during
training, voting for the likelihood of each category in spatial dimensions.
After dilating alignment on the area with large likelihood values, the voting
results are regularized as bounding boxes, being used for the final
classification and localization. Based on SLV, we further propose an end-to-end
training framework for multi-task learning. The classification and localization

such as the dissemination of ideas, beliefs or behaviors, social learning and
the diffusion of innovations. Different mechanisms have been proposed to
implement inter-agent influence in social models from the voter model, to
majority rules, to the Granoveter model. Here we advance in this direction by
confronting the recently introduced Social Influence and Recurrent Mobility
(SIRM) model, that reproduces generic features of vote-shares at different
geographical levels, with data in the US presidential elections. Our approach
incorporates spatial and population diversity as inputs for the opinion
dynamics while individuals' mobility provides a proxy for social context, and
peer imitation accounts for social influence. The model captures the observed
stationary background fluctuations in the vote-shares across counties. We study
the so-called political strongholds, i.e., locations where the votes-shares for
a party are systematically higher than average. A quantitative definition of a
stronghold by means of persistence in time of fluctuations in the voting
spatial distribution is introduced, and results from the US Presidential
Elections during the period 1980-2012 are analyzed within this framework. We
compare electoral results with simulations obtained with the SIRM model finding
a good agreement both in terms of the number and the location of strongholds.
The strongholds duration is also systematically characterized in the SIRM

Taking into account asymmetries and imperfect perception of culture, we measure

propose the Friend-or-Foe coefficient, a metric to measure voting biases among

cultural affinity through its relation with known cultural distances, and
through numerical analysis of biased Eurovision contests. We apply this metric
to the historical set of Eurovision contests from 1975 to 2012, finding new
patterns of stronger modularity than using votes alone. Furthermore, we define
a measure of polarization that, when applied to empirical data, shows a sharp

series of new results. We give new data-dependent margin guarantees for
structured prediction for a very wide family of loss functions and a general
family of hypotheses, with an arbitrary factor graph decomposition. These are
the tightest margin bounds known for both standard multi-class and general
structured prediction problems. Our guarantees are expressed in terms of a
data-dependent complexity measure, factor graph complexity, which we show can
be estimated from data and bounded in terms of familiar quantities. We further
extend our theory by leveraging the principle of Voted Risk Minimization (VRM)
and show that learning is possible even with complex factor graphs. We present
new learning bounds for this advanced setting, which we use to design two new
algorithms, Voted Conditional Random Field (VCRF) and Voted Structured Boosting

137,Canonical Voting: Towards Robust Oriented Bounding Box Detection in 3D Scenes,"3D object detection has attracted much attention thanks to the advances in
sensors and deep learning methods for point clouds. Current state-of-the-art
methods like VoteNet regress direct offset towards object centers and box
orientations with an additional Multi-Layer-Perceptron network. Both their
offset and orientation predictions are not accurate due to the fundamental
difficulty in rotation classification. In the work, we disentangle the direct
offset into Local Canonical Coordinates (LCC), box scales and box orientations.
Only LCC and box scales are regressed, while box orientations are generated by
a canonical voting scheme. Finally, an LCC-aware back-projection checking
algorithm iteratively cuts out bounding boxes from the generated vote maps,
with the elimination of false positives. Our model achieves state-of-the-art
performance on three standard real-world benchmarks: ScanNet, SceneNN and SUN

138,"Inducing Interpretable Voting Classifiers without Trading Accuracy for Simplicity: Theoretical Results, Approximation Algorithms","Recent advances in the study of voting classification algorithms have brought
empirical and theoretical results clearly showing the discrimination power of
ensemble classifiers. It has been previously argued that the search of this
classification power in the design of the algorithms has marginalized the need
to obtain interpretable classifiers. Therefore, the question of whether one
might have to dispense with interpretability in order to keep classification
strength is being raised in a growing number of machine learning or data mining
papers. The purpose of this paper is to study both theoretically and
empirically the problem. First, we provide numerous results giving insight into
the hardness of the simplicity-accuracy tradeoff for voting classifiers. Then
we provide an efficient ""top-down and prune"" induction heuristic, WIDC, mainly
derived from recent results on the weak learning and boosting frameworks. It is
to our knowledge the first attempt to build a voting classifier as a base
formula using the weak learning framework (the one which was previously highly
successful for decision tree induction), and not the strong learning framework
(as usual for such classifiers with boosting-like approaches). While it uses a
well-known induction scheme previously successful in other classes of concept
representations, thus making it easy to implement and compare, WIDC also relies
on recent or new results we give about particular cases of boosting known as
partition boosting and ranking loss boosting. Experimental results on
thirty-one domains, most of which readily available, tend to display the
ability of WIDC to produce small, accurate, and interpretable decision
committees.",1106.1818v1,cs.AI,2011-06-09 13:56:01+00:00,[arxiv.Result.Author('R. Nock')],"Journal Of Artificial Intelligence Research, Volume 17, pages

well as the efforts of various scholars including Guimera and Sales-Pardo
(2011), Ruger et al. (2004), and Martin et al. (2004), we construct a model
designed to predict the voting behavior of the Supreme Court of the United
States. Using the extremely randomized tree method first proposed in Geurts, et
al. (2006), a method similar to the random forest approach developed in Breiman
(2001), as well as novel feature engineering, we predict more than sixty years
of decisions by the Supreme Court of the United States (1953-2013). Using only
data available prior to the date of decision, our model correctly identifies
69.7% of the Court's overall affirm and reverse decisions and correctly
forecasts 70.9% of the votes of individual justices across 7,700 cases and more
than 68,000 justice votes. Our performance is consistent with the general level
of prediction offered by prior scholars. However, our model is distinctive as
it is the first robust, generalized, and fully predictive model of Supreme
Court voting behavior offered to date. Our model predicts six decades of
behavior of thirty Justices appointed by thirteen Presidents. With a more sound
methodological foundation, our results represent a major advance for the
science of quantitative legal prediction and portend a range of other potential
applications, such as those described in Katz (2013).",1407.6333v1,physics.soc-ph,2014-07-23 19:08:33+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Daniel Martin Katz'), arxiv.Result.Author('Michael J Bommarito II'), arxiv.Result.Author('Josh Blackman')]",

as a Markov decision process and use dynamic programming to optimize the

advisories given to pilots, but these tables can grow very large. To enable the
system to operate on limited hardware, prior work investigated compressing the
table using a deep neural network. However, ensuring that the neural network
reliably issues safe advisories is important for certification. This work
defines linearized regions where each advisory can be safely provided, allowing
Reluplex, a neural network verification tool, to check if unsafe advisories are
ever issued. A notional collision avoidance policy is generated and used to
train a neural network representation. The neural networks are checked for
unsafe advisories, resulting in the discovery of thousands of unsafe

144,Identifying Possible Winners in Ranked Choice Voting Elections with Outstanding Ballots,"Several election districts in the US have recently moved to ranked-choice
voting (RCV) to decide the results of local elections. RCV allows voters to
rank their choices, and the results are computed in rounds, eliminating one
candidate at a time. RCV ensures fairer elections and has been shown to
increase elected representation of women and people of color. A main drawback
of RCV is that the round-by-round process requires all the ballots to be
tallied before the results of an election can be calculated. With increasingly
large portions of ballots coming from absentee voters, RCV election outcomes
are not always apparent on election night, and can take several weeks to be
published, leading to a loss of trust in the electoral process from the public.
In this paper, we present an algorithm for efficiently computing possible
winners of RCV elections from partially known ballots and evaluate it on data
from the recent New York City Primary elections. We show that our techniques
allow to significantly narrow down the field of possible election winners, and
in some case identify the winner as soon as election night despite a number of
yet-unaccounted absentee ballots, providing more transparency in the electoral
process.",2206.12741v1,cs.CY,2022-06-25 22:08:15+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Alborz Jelvani'), arxiv.Result.Author('Amélie Marian')]",
145,Automated Mapping of Vulnerability Advisories onto their Fix Commits in Open Source Repositories,"The lack of comprehensive sources of accurate vulnerability data represents a
critical obstacle to studying and understanding software vulnerabilities (and
their corrections). In this paper, we present an approach that combines
heuristics stemming from practical experience and machine-learning (ML) -
specifically, natural language processing (NLP) - to address this problem. Our
method consists of three phases. First, an advisory record containing key
information about a vulnerability is extracted from an advisory (expressed in
natural language). Second, using heuristics, a subset of candidate fix commits
is obtained from the source code repository of the affected project by
filtering out commits that are known to be irrelevant for the task at hand.
Finally, for each such candidate commit, our method builds a numerical feature
vector reflecting the characteristics of the commit that are relevant to
predicting its match with the advisory at hand. The feature vectors are then
exploited for building a final ranked list of candidate fixing commits. The
score attributed by the ML model to each feature is kept visible to the users,
allowing them to interpret of the predictions.
  We evaluated our approach using a prototype implementation named Prospector
on a manually curated data set that comprises 2,391 known fix commits
corresponding to 1,248 public vulnerability advisories. When considering the
top-10 commits in the ranked results, our implementation could successfully
identify at least one fix commit for up to 84.03% of the vulnerabilities (with
a fix commit on the first position for 65.06% of the vulnerabilities). In
conclusion, our method reduces considerably the effort needed to search OSS
repositories for the commits that fix known vulnerabilities.",2103.13375v1,cs.SE,2021-03-24 17:50:35+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Daan Hommersom'), arxiv.Result.Author('Antonino Sabetta'), arxiv.Result.Author('Bonaventura Coppola'), arxiv.Result.Author('Damian A. Tamburri')]",

148,Collision Risk and Operational Impact of Speed Change Advisories as Aircraft Collision Avoidance Maneuvers,"Aircraft collision avoidance systems have long been a key factor in keeping
our airspace safe. Over the past decade, the FAA has supported the development
of a new family of collision avoidance systems called the Airborne Collision
Avoidance System X (ACAS X), which model the collision avoidance problem as a
Markov decision process (MDP). Variants of ACAS X have been created for both
manned (ACAS Xa) and unmanned aircraft (ACAS Xu and ACAS sXu). The variants
primarily differ in the types of collision avoidance maneuvers they issue. For
example, ACAS Xa issues vertical collision avoidance advisories, while ACAS Xu
and ACAS sXu allow for horizontal advisories due to reduced aircraft
performance capabilities. Currently, a new variant of ACAS X, called ACAS Xr,
is being developed to provide collision avoidance capability to rotorcraft and
Advanced Air Mobility (AAM) vehicles. Due to the desire to minimize deviation
from the prescribed flight path of these aircraft, speed adjustments have been
proposed as a potential collision avoidance maneuver for aircraft using ACAS
Xr. In this work, we investigate the effect of speed change advisories on the
safety and operational efficiency of collision avoidance systems. We develop an
MDP-based collision avoidance logic that issues speed advisories and compare
its performance to that of horizontal and vertical logics through Monte Carlo
simulation on existing airspace encounter models. Our results show that while
speed advisories are able to reduce collision risk, they are neither as safe

151,The Price of Political Uncertainty: Evidence from the 2016 U.S. Presidential Election and the U.S. Stock Markets,"There is bountiful evidence that political uncertainty stemming from
presidential elections or doubt about the direction of future policy make
financial markets significantly volatile, especially in proximity to close
elections or elections that may prompt radical policy changes. Although several
studies have examined the association between presidential elections and stock
returns, very little attention has been given to the impacts of elections and
election induced uncertainty on stock markets. This paper explores, at sectoral
level, the uncertain information hypothesis (UIH) as a means of explaining the
reaction of markets to the arrival of unanticipated information. This
hypothesis postulates that political uncertainty is greater prior to the
elections (relative to pre-election period) but is resolved once the outcome of
the elections is determined (relative to post-election period). To this end, we
adopt an event-study methodology that examines abnormal return behavior around
the election date. We show that collapsing stock returns around the election
result is reversed by positive abnormal return on the next day, except some
cases where we note negative responses following the vote count. Although
Trump's win plunges US into uncertain future, positive reactions of abnormal
return are found. Therefore, our results do not support the UIH hypothesis.
Besides, the effect of political uncertainty is sector-specific. While some
sectors emerged winners (healthcare, oil and gas, real estate, defense,
financials and consumer goods and services), others took the opposite route
(technology and utilities). The winning industries are generally those that
will benefit from the new administration's focus on rebuilding infrastructure,
renegotiating trade agreements, reforming tax policy and labour laws,
increasing defense funding, easing restrictions on energy production, and

158,Sublinear Bounds for Randomized Leader Election,"This paper concerns {\em randomized} leader election in synchronous
distributed networks. A distributed leader election algorithm is presented for
complete $n$-node networks that runs in O(1) rounds and (with high probability)
uses only $O(\sqrt{n}\log^{3/2} n)$ messages to elect a unique leader (with
high probability). When considering the ""explicit"" variant of leader election
where eventually every node knows the identity of the leader, our algorithm
yields the asymptotically optimal bounds of O(1) rounds and O(n) messages. This
algorithm is then extended to one solving leader election on any connected
non-bipartite $n$-node graph $G$ in $O(\tau(G))$ time and
$O(\tau(G)\sqrt{n}\log^{3/2} n)$ messages, where $\tau(G)$ is the mixing time
of a random walk on $G$. The above result implies highly efficient (sublinear
running time and messages) leader election algorithms for networks with small
mixing times, such as expanders and hypercubes. In contrast, previous leader
election algorithms had at least linear message complexity even in complete
graphs. Moreover, super-linear message lower bounds are known for
time-efficient {\em deterministic} leader election algorithms.

election, showing that $\Omega(\sqrt n)$ messages are needed for any leader
election algorithm that succeeds with probability at least $1/e + \eps$, for

160,Robust Asset Allocation for Robo-Advisors,"In the last few years, the financial advisory industry has been impacted by
the emergence of digitalization and robo-advisors. This phenomenon affects
major financial services, including wealth management, employee savings plans,
asset managers, etc. Since the robo-advisory model is in its early stages, we
estimate that robo-advisors will help to manage around $1 trillion of assets in
2020 (OECD, 2017). And this trend is not going to stop with future generations,
who will live in a technology-driven and social media-based world. In the
investment industry, robo-advisors face different challenges: client profiling,
customization, asset pooling, liability constraints, etc. In its primary sense,
robo-advisory is a term for defining automated portfolio management. This
includes automated trading and rebalancing, but also automated portfolio
allocation. And this last issue is certainly the most important challenge for
robo-advisory over the next five years. Today, in many robo-advisors, asset
allocation is rather human-based and very far from being computer-based. The
reason is that portfolio optimization is a very difficult task, and can lead to
optimized mathematical solutions that are not optimal from a financial point of
view (Michaud, 1989). The big challenge for robo-advisors is therefore to be
able to optimize and rebalance hundreds of optimal portfolios without human
intervention. In this paper, we show that the mean-variance optimization
approach is mainly driven by arbitrage factors that are related to the concept
of hedging portfolios. This is why regularization and sparsity are necessary to
define robust asset allocation. However, this mathematical framework is more
complex and requires understanding how norm penalties impacts portfolio
optimization. From a numerical point of view, it also requires the
implementation of non-traditional algorithms based on ADMM methods.",1902.07449v1,q-fin.PM,2019-02-20 08:30:29+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Thibault Bourgeron'), arxiv.Result.Author('Edmond Lezmi'), arxiv.Result.Author('Thierry Roncalli')]",

Council (NIIAC) and the Canadian Information Highway Advisory Council (IHAC) in

acknowledging the private sector as the primary creator of the Information

narrative, and discourse analyses to create a picture of what universal service

U.S. had started with a more clearly defined universal service tradition than
Canada, and undertook a more complex policy-making process with more

field studies in software engineering. Research typically recruits
practitioners through some kind of sampling. But sampling may not in itself
recruit credible participants. Objectives: To propose and demonstrate a
framework for recruiting professional practitioners as credible participants in
field studies of software engineering. Method: We review existing guidelines,
checklists and other advisory sources on recruiting participants for field
studies. We develop a framework, partly based on our prior research and on the
research of others. We search for and select three exemplar studies (a case
study, an interview study and a survey study) and use those to demonstrate the
application of the framework. Results: Whilst existing guidelines etc.
recognise the importance of recruiting participants, there is limited guidance
on how to recruit the right participants. Our demonstration of the framework
with three exemplars shows that at least some members of the research community
are aware of the need to carefully recruit participants. Conclusions: The
framework provides a new perspective for thinking about the recruitment of
credible practitioners for field studies of software engineering. In

Reluplex, a neural network verification tool, to check if unsafe advisories are

166,Investigation of passive flow control over an airfoil using leading edge tubercles,"The present paper numerically investigates flow control over NACA0021
(National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics) airfoil by applying a
leading-edge tubercle as a passive flow control device at transitional Reynolds
number (Re) regime. The study includes simulations over the unmodified airfoil
and modified airfoil operating at Re=120000 using kT-kL-{\omega} based Delayed
Detached Eddy Simulation (DDES) model. The calculations include both the
pre-stall and post-stall regions, while the performance of the mean flow
aerodynamic properties like pressure, lift, skin-friction, and drag
coefficients are also investigated in the presence of tubercles. The spanwise
flow over the modified airfoil interacts with the primary flow. The turbulent
separation gets delayed compared to the unmodified airfoil, thereby
significantly improving the stall behavior and flow behavior in the post-stall
region. The modified airfoil provides the gradual stall behavior against the
steep stall behavior for the unmodified airfoil. To optimize tubercle
configuration, the study considers two modified airfoils with different
combinations of amplitude and wavelength. The unsteady analysis, including the
reduced-order modeling, i.e. 3D Proper orthogonal decomposition (POD),
characterizes the dominant vortical structure of the flow to evaluate the
improvement in the aerodynamic performance of the modified airfoil. The model
decomposition for flow over airfoil helps to provide a deeper understanding of
the flow control phenomenon.",2103.08854v1,physics.flu-dyn,2021-03-16 05:26:14+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Alok Mishra'), arxiv.Result.Author('Ashoke De')]",Journal of Flow Visualization and Image Processing 2022
167,Automated Mapping of Vulnerability Advisories onto their Fix Commits in Open Source Repositories,"The lack of comprehensive sources of accurate vulnerability data represents a
critical obstacle to studying and understanding software vulnerabilities (and
their corrections). In this paper, we present an approach that combines
heuristics stemming from practical experience and machine-learning (ML) -
specifically, natural language processing (NLP) - to address this problem. Our
method consists of three phases. First, an advisory record containing key
information about a vulnerability is extracted from an advisory (expressed in
natural language). Second, using heuristics, a subset of candidate fix commits
is obtained from the source code repository of the affected project by
filtering out commits that are known to be irrelevant for the task at hand.
Finally, for each such candidate commit, our method builds a numerical feature
vector reflecting the characteristics of the commit that are relevant to
predicting its match with the advisory at hand. The feature vectors are then
exploited for building a final ranked list of candidate fixing commits. The
score attributed by the ML model to each feature is kept visible to the users,
allowing them to interpret of the predictions.
  We evaluated our approach using a prototype implementation named Prospector
on a manually curated data set that comprises 2,391 known fix commits
corresponding to 1,248 public vulnerability advisories. When considering the
top-10 commits in the ranked results, our implementation could successfully
identify at least one fix commit for up to 84.03% of the vulnerabilities (with
a fix commit on the first position for 65.06% of the vulnerabilities). In
conclusion, our method reduces considerably the effort needed to search OSS
repositories for the commits that fix known vulnerabilities.",2103.13375v1,cs.SE,2021-03-24 17:50:35+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Daan Hommersom'), arxiv.Result.Author('Antonino Sabetta'), arxiv.Result.Author('Bonaventura Coppola'), arxiv.Result.Author('Damian A. Tamburri')]",
168,Collision Risk and Operational Impact of Speed Change Advisories as Aircraft Collision Avoidance Maneuvers,"Aircraft collision avoidance systems have long been a key factor in keeping
our airspace safe. Over the past decade, the FAA has supported the development
of a new family of collision avoidance systems called the Airborne Collision
Avoidance System X (ACAS X), which model the collision avoidance problem as a
Markov decision process (MDP). Variants of ACAS X have been created for both
manned (ACAS Xa) and unmanned aircraft (ACAS Xu and ACAS sXu). The variants
primarily differ in the types of collision avoidance maneuvers they issue. For
example, ACAS Xa issues vertical collision avoidance advisories, while ACAS Xu
and ACAS sXu allow for horizontal advisories due to reduced aircraft
performance capabilities. Currently, a new variant of ACAS X, called ACAS Xr,
is being developed to provide collision avoidance capability to rotorcraft and
Advanced Air Mobility (AAM) vehicles. Due to the desire to minimize deviation
from the prescribed flight path of these aircraft, speed adjustments have been
proposed as a potential collision avoidance maneuver for aircraft using ACAS
Xr. In this work, we investigate the effect of speed change advisories on the
safety and operational efficiency of collision avoidance systems. We develop an
MDP-based collision avoidance logic that issues speed advisories and compare
its performance to that of horizontal and vertical logics through Monte Carlo
simulation on existing airspace encounter models. Our results show that while
speed advisories are able to reduce collision risk, they are neither as safe
nor as efficient as their horizontal and vertical counterparts.",2204.14250v1,cs.RO,2022-04-29 17:27:20+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Sydney M. Katz'), arxiv.Result.Author('Luis E.

171,Data-driven Driver Model for Speed Advisory Systems in Partially Automated Vehicles,"Vehicle control algorithms exploiting connectivity and automation, such as
Connected and Automated Vehicles (CAVs) or Advanced Driver Assistance Systems
(ADAS), have the opportunity to improve energy savings. However, lower levels
of automation involve a human-machine interaction stage, where the presence of
a human driver affects the performance of the control algorithm in closed loop.
This occurs for instance in the case of Eco-Driving control algorithms
implemented as a velocity advisory system, where the driver is displayed an
optimal speed trajectory to follow to reduce energy consumption. Achieving the
control objectives relies on the human driver perfectly following the
recommended speed. If the driver is unable to follow the recommended speed, a
decline in energy savings and poor vehicle performance may occur. This warrants
the creation of methods to model and forecast the response of a human driver
when operating in the loop with a speed advisory system.
  This work focuses on developing a sequence to sequence long-short term memory
(LSTM)-based driver behavior model that models the interaction of the human
driver to a suggested desired vehicle speed trajectory in real-world
conditions. A driving simulator is used for data collection and training the
driver model, which is then compared against the driving data and a
deterministic model. Results show close proximity of the LSTM-based model with
the driving data, demonstrating that the model can be adopted as a tool to
design human-centered speed advisory systems.",2205.08445v1,cs.RO,2022-05-17 15:37:56+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Olivia Jacome'), arxiv.Result.Author('Shobhit Gupta'), arxiv.Result.Author('Stephanie Stockar'), arxiv.Result.Author('Marcello Canova')]",

flow of information from the farmers to the experts/expert systems, and vice

multimedia data regarding disease or pest attack in the crops is required to be
transmitted to the experts for analysis. Further, after analyzing the query, an
alert or advice from the expert system is required to be communicated back to
the farmers within some tolerable delay. However, in a country like India,
network connectivity is extremely poor in several agricultural regions which
makes the end-to-end connectivity between the farmers and the expert system
intermittent. Therefore, providing agro-advisory services to farmers in a
reasonable time becomes a challenge. In this paper, we propose a Delay Tolerant

enough members who have as broad a range of expertise and understanding as

requires knowing how the ballots cast in an election are organized into groups,
for instance, how many containers of ballots there are in all and how many
ballots are in each container. A list of the ballot group identifiers along
with number of ballots in each group is called a ballot manifest. What if the
ballot manifest is not accurate? Surprisingly, even if ballots are known to be
missing from the manifest, it is not necessary to make worst-case assumptions
about those ballots--for instance, to adjust the margin by the number of
missing ballots--to ensure that the audit remains conservative. Rather, it
suffices to make worst-case assumptions about the individual randomly selected
ballots that the audit cannot find. This observation provides a simple
modification to some risk-limiting audit procedures that makes them
automatically become more conservative if the ballot manifest has errors. The
modification--phantoms to evil zombies (~2EZ)--requires only an upper bound on
the total number of ballots cast. ~2EZ makes the audit P-value stochastically
larger than it would be had the manifest been accurate, automatically requiring
more than enough ballots to be audited to offset the manifest errors. This
ensures that the true risk limit remains smaller than the nominal risk limit.
On the other hand, if the manifest is in fact accurate and the upper bound on
the total number of ballots equals the total according to the manifest, ~2EZ
has no effect at all on the number of ballots audited nor on the true risk

into subgroups (or districts), the adversary can construct a so-called ""Devil's
Menu"" consisting of several prices. In equilibrium, the adversary can buy the
real ballots of any strict subset of districts at a price corresponding to the
willingness to sell on the part of the citizens holding such ballots. By
contrast, decoy voters are trapped into selling their ballots at a low, or even
negligible, price. Blowing up the adversary's budget by introducing decoy
ballots may thus turn out to be futile. The Devil's Menu can also be applied to
the well-known ""Lemons Problem"".",1712.05477v1,cs.GT,2017-12-14 23:54:58+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Hans Gersbach'), arxiv.Result.Author('Akaki Mamageishvili'), arxiv.Result.Author('Oriol Tejada')]",
186,The ATHENA Class of Risk-Limiting Ballot Polling Audits,"The main risk-limiting ballot polling audit in use today, BRAVO, is designed
for use when single ballots are drawn at random and a decision regarding
whether to stop the audit or draw another ballot is taken after each ballot
draw (ballot-by-ballot (B2) audits). On the other hand, real ballot polling
audits draw many ballots in a single round before determining whether to stop
(round-by-round (R2) audits). We show that BRAVO results in significant
inefficiency when directly applied to real R2 audits. We present the ATHENA
class of R2 stopping rules, which we show are risk-limiting if the round
schedule is pre-determined (before the audit begins). We prove that each rule
is at least as efficient as the corresponding BRAVO stopping rule applied at
the end of the round. We have open-source software libraries implementing most
of our results.
  We show that ATHENA halves the number of ballots required, for all state
margins in the 2016 US Presidential election and a first round with $90\%$
stopping probability, when compared to BRAVO (stopping rule applied at the end
of the round). We present simulation results supporting the 90% stopping
probability claims and our claims for the risk accrued in the first round.
Further, ATHENA reduces the number of ballots by more than a quarter for low
margins, when compared to the BRAVO stopping rule applied on ballots in
selection order. This implies that keeping track of the order when drawing
ballots R2 is not beneficial, because ATHENA is more efficient even without
information on selection order. These results are significant because current
approaches to real ballot polling election audits use the B2 BRAVO rules,
requiring about twice as much work on the part of election officials. Applying
the rules in selection order requires fewer ballots, but keeping track of the
order, and entering it into audit software, adds to the effort.",2008.02315v5,cs.CR,2020-08-05 18:47:37+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Filip Zagórski'), arxiv.Result.Author('Grant McClearn'), arxiv.Result.Author('Sarah Morin'), arxiv.Result.Author('Neal McBurnett'), arxiv.Result.Author('Poorvi L.

187,$k$-Cut: A Simple Approximately-Uniform Method for Sampling Ballots in Post-Election Audits,"We present an approximate sampling framework and discuss how risk-limiting
audits can compensate for these approximations, while maintaining their
""risk-limiting"" properties. Our framework is general and can compensate for
counting mistakes made during audits.
  Moreover, we present and analyze a simple approximate sampling
method,""$k$-cut"", for picking a ballot randomly from a stack, without counting.
Our method involves doing $k$ ""cuts"", each involving moving a random portion of
ballots from the top to the bottom of the stack, and then picking the ballot on
top. Unlike conventional methods of picking a ballot at random, $k$-cut does
not require identification numbers on the ballots or counting many ballots per
draw. We analyze how close the distribution of chosen ballots is to the uniform
distribution, and design different mitigation procedures. We show that $k=6$
cuts is enough for an risk-limiting election audit, based on empirical data,
which would provide a significant increase in efficiency.",1811.08811v3,cs.DS,2018-11-21 16:26:33+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Mayuri Sridhar'), arxiv.Result.Author('Ronald L. Rivest')]",
188,Bernoulli Ballot Polling: A Manifest Improvement for Risk-Limiting Audits,"We present a method and software for ballot-polling risk-limiting audits

probability $p$, independently. Bernoulli sampling has several advantages: (1)
it does not require a ballot manifest; (2) it can be conducted independently at
different locations, rather than requiring a central authority to select the
sample from the whole population of cast ballots or requiring stratified
sampling; (3) it can start in polling places on election night, before margins
are known. If the reported margins for the 2016 U.S. Presidential election are
correct, a Bernoulli ballot-polling audit with a risk limit of 5% and a
sampling rate of $p_0 = 1\%$ would have had at least a 99% probability of
confirming the outcome in 42 states. (The other states were more likely to have
needed to examine additional ballots.) Logistical and security advantages that
auditing in the polling place affords may outweigh the cost of examining more
ballots than some other methods might require.",1812.06361v1,stat.AP,2018-12-15 21:57:23+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Kellie Ottoboni'), arxiv.Result.Author('Matthew Bernhard'), arxiv.Result.Author('J.

surrounded by two ballot paths. We study the relations of combinatorial objects
which are bijective to symmetric Dyck tilings such as labeled trees, Hermite
histories, and perfect matchings. We also introduce two operations on labeled
trees for symmetric Dyck tilings: symmetric Dyck tiling strip (symDTS) and
symmetric Dyck tiling ribbon (symDTR). We give two definitions of Hermite
histories for symmetric Dyck tilings, and show that they are equivalent by use
of the correspondence between symDTS operation and an Hermite history. Since
ballot tilings form a subset in the set of symmetric Dyck tilings, we construct
an inclusive map from labeled trees for ballot tilings to labeled trees for
symmetric Dyck tilings. By this inclusive map, the results for symmetric Dyck
tilings can be applied to those of ballot tilings. We introduce and study the
notions of ballot tableaux and tree-like tableaux of shifted shapes, which are
generalizations of Dyck tableaux and tree-like tableaux, respectively. The
correspondence between ballot tableaux and tree-like tableaux of shifted shapes
is given by using the symDTR operation and the structure of labeled trees for
symmetric Dyck tilings.",2011.07296v1,math.CO,2020-11-14 13:15:14+00:00,[arxiv.Result.Author('Keiichi Shigechi')],
190,SOBA: Secrecy-preserving Observable Ballot-level Audit,"SOBA is an approach to election verification that provides observers with
justifiably high confidence that the reported results of an election are
consistent with an audit trail (""ballots""), which can be paper or electronic.
SOBA combines three ideas: (1) publishing cast vote records (CVRs) separately
for each contest, so that anyone can verify that each reported contest outcome
is correct, if the CVRs reflect voters' intentions with sufficient accuracy;
(2) shrouding a mapping between ballots and the CVRs for those ballots to
prevent the loss of privacy that could occur otherwise; (3) assessing the
accuracy with which the CVRs reflect voters' intentions for a collection of
contests while simultaneously assessing the integrity of the shrouded mapping
between ballots and CVRs by comparing randomly selected ballots to the CVRs
that purport to represent them. Step (1) is related to work by the Humboldt
County Election Transparency Project, but publishing CVRs separately for
individual contests rather than images of entire ballots preserves privacy.
Step (2) requires a cryptographic commitment from elections officials.
Observers participate in step (3), which relies on the ""super-simple
simultaneous single-ballot risk-limiting audit."" Step (3) is designed to reveal
relatively few ballots if the shrouded mapping is proper and the CVRs
accurately reflect voter intent. But if the reported outcomes of the contests
differ from the outcomes that a full hand count would show, step (3) is
guaranteed to have a large chance of requiring all the ballots to be counted by
hand, thereby limiting the risk that an incorrect outcome will become official
and final.",1105.5803v2,stat.AP,2011-05-29 17:00:20+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Josh Benaloh'), arxiv.Result.Author('Douglas Jones'), arxiv.Result.Author('Eric Lazarus'), arxiv.Result.Author('Mark Lindeman'), arxiv.Result.Author('Philip B. Stark')]",
191,"Voter Verification of BMD Ballots Is a Two-Part Question: Can They? Mostly, They Can. Do They? Mostly, They Don't","The question of whether or not voters actually verify ballots produced by
ballot marking devices (BMDs) is presently the subject of some controversy.
Recent studies (e.g., Bernhard, et al. 2020) suggest the verification rate is
low. What is not clear from previous research is whether this is more a result
of voters being unable to do so accurately or whether this is because voters
simply choose not to attempt verification in the first place. In order to
understand this problem, we conducted an experiment in which 108 participants
participated in a mock election where the BMD displayed the voters' true
choices, but then changed a subset of those choices on the printed ballot. The
design of the printed ballot, the length of the ballot, the number of changes
that were made to the ballot, the location of those changes, and the
instructions provided to the voters were manipulated as part of the experiment.
Results indicated that of those voters who chose to examine the printed ballot,
76% detected anomalies, indicating that voters can reliably detect errors on
their ballot if they will simply review it. This suggests that administrative
remedies, rather than attempts to alter fundamental human perceptual
capabilities, could be employed to encourage voters to check their ballots,
which could prove as an effective countermeasure.",2003.04997v1,cs.HC,2020-03-10 21:06:42+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Philip Kortum'), arxiv.Result.Author('Michael D. Byrne'), arxiv.Result.Author('Julie Whitmore')]",

2017, including both ballot-level comparison audits and ballot-polling audits.
Those audits only covered contests restricted to a single county; methods to
efficiently audit contests that cross county boundaries and combine ballot
polling and ballot-level comparisons have not been available.
  Colorado's current audit software (RLATool) needs to be improved to audit
these contests that cross county lines and to audit small contests efficiently.
  This paper addresses these needs. It presents extremely simple but
inefficient methods, more efficient methods that combine ballot polling and
ballot-level comparisons using stratified samples, and methods that combine
ballot-level comparison and variable-size batch comparison audits in a way that
does not require stratified sampling.
  We conclude with some recommendations, and illustrate our recommended method

incorrect election results, independent of why the result was incorrect.
Ballot-polling audits select ballots at random and interpret those ballots as
evidence for and against the reported result, continuing this process until
either they support the recorded result, or they fall back to a full manual
recount. For elections with digitised scanning and counting of ballots, a
comparison audit compares randomly selected digital ballots with their paper
versions. Discrepancies are referred to as errors, and are used to build
evidence against or in support of the recorded result. Risk-limiting audits for
first-past-the-post elections are well understood, and used in some US
elections. We define a number of approaches to ballot-polling and comparison
risk-limiting audits for Instant Runoff Voting (IRV) elections. We show that
for almost all real elections we found, we can perform a risk-limiting audit by
looking at only a small fraction of the total ballots (assuming no errors were
made in the tallying and distribution of votes).",1903.08804v2,cs.DS,2019-03-20 06:19:10+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Michelle Blom'), arxiv.Result.Author('Peter J. Stuckey'), arxiv.Result.Author('Vanessa Teague')]",

permutations and odd order permutations, which proves a set-valued extension of
a conjecture due to Spiro using the statistic of peak values. This bijection
also preserves the neighbors of the largest letter in permutations and thus
resolves a refinement of Spiro' s conjecture proposed by Wang and Zhang. Our
decomposition can be extended to well-labelled positive paths, a class of
generalized ballot permutations arising from polytope theory, that were
enumerated by Bernardi, Duplantier and Nadeau. We will also investigate the

195,Ballot Length in Instant Runoff Voting,"Instant runoff voting (IRV) is an increasingly-popular alternative to
traditional plurality voting in which voters submit rankings over the
candidates rather than single votes. In practice, elections using IRV often
restrict the ballot length, the number of candidates a voter is allowed to rank
on their ballot. We theoretically and empirically analyze how ballot length can
influence the outcome of an election, given fixed voter preferences. We show
that there exist preference profiles over $k$ candidates such that up to $k-1$
different candidates win at different ballot lengths. We derive exact lower
bounds on the number of voters required for such profiles and provide a
construction matching the lower bound for unrestricted voter preferences.
Additionally, we characterize which sequences of winners are possible over
ballot lengths and provide explicit profile constructions achieving any
feasible winner sequence. We also examine how classic preference restrictions
influence our results--for instance, single-peakedness makes $k-1$ different
winners impossible but still allows at least $\Omega(\sqrt k)$. Finally, we
analyze a collection of 168 real-world elections, where we truncate rankings to
simulate shorter ballots. We find that shorter ballots could have changed the
outcome in one quarter of these elections. Our results highlight ballot length
as a consequential degree of freedom in the design of IRV elections.",2207.08958v3,cs.MA,2022-07-18 22:01:13+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Kiran Tomlinson'), arxiv.Result.Author('Johan Ugander'), arxiv.Result.Author('Jon Kleinberg')]",
