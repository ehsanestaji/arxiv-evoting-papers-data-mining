0,How Many Vote Operations Are Needed to Manipulate A Voting System?,"In this paper, we propose a framework to study a general class of strategic
behavior in voting, which we call vote operations. We prove the following
theorem: if we fix the number of alternatives, generate $n$ votes i.i.d.
according to a distribution $\pi$, and let $n$ go to infinity, then for any
$\epsilon >0$, with probability at least $1-\epsilon$, the minimum number of
operations that are needed for the strategic individual to achieve her goal
falls into one of the following four categories: (1) 0, (2) $\Theta(\sqrt n)$,
(3) $\Theta(n)$, and (4) $\infty$. This theorem holds for any set of vote
operations, any individual vote distribution $\pi$, and any integer generalized
scoring rule, which includes (but is not limited to) almost all commonly
studied voting rules, e.g., approval voting, all positional scoring rules
(including Borda, plurality, and veto), plurality with runoff, Bucklin,
Copeland, maximin, STV, and ranked pairs.
  We also show that many well-studied types of strategic behavior fall under
our framework, including (but not limited to) constructive/destructive
manipulation, bribery, and control by adding/deleting votes, margin of victory,
and minimum manipulation coalition size. Therefore, our main theorem naturally
applies to these problems.",1204.1231v3,cs.AI,2012-04-05 14:00:21+00:00,[arxiv.Result.Author('Lirong Xia')],
1,Distance Restricted Manipulation in Voting,"We introduce the notion of {\em Distance Restricted Manipulation}, where
colluding manipulator(s) need to compute if there exist votes which make their
preferred alternative win the election when their knowledge about the others'
votes is a little inaccurate. We use the Kendall-Tau distance to model the
manipulators' confidence in the non-manipulators' votes. To this end, we study
this problem in two settings - one where the manipulators need to compute a
manipulating vote that succeeds irrespective of perturbations in others' votes
({\em Distance Restricted Strong Manipulation}), and the second where the
manipulators need to compute a manipulating vote that succeeds for at least one
possible vote profile of the others ({\em Distance Restricted Weak
Manipulation}). We show that {\em Distance Restricted Strong Manipulation}
admits polynomial-time algorithms for every scoring rule, maximin, Bucklin, and
simplified Bucklin voting rules for a single manipulator, and for the
$k$-approval rule for any number of manipulators, but becomes intractable for
the Copeland$^\alpha$ voting rule for every $\alpha\in[0,1]$ even for a single
manipulator. In contrast, {\em Distance Restricted Weak Manipulation} is
intractable for almost all the common voting rules, with the exception of the
plurality rule. For a constant number of alternatives, we show that both the
problems are polynomial-time solvable for every anonymous and efficient voting
rule.",1909.03162v2,cs.GT,2019-09-07 01:29:32+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Aditya Anand'), arxiv.Result.Author('Palash Dey')]",
2,Tradeoffs in Hierarchical Voting Systems,"Condorcet's jury theorem states that the correct outcome is reached in direct
majority voting systems with sufficiently large electorates as long as each
voter's independent probability of voting for that outcome is greater than 0.5.
Yet, in situations where direct voting systems are infeasible, such as due to
high implementation and infrastructure costs, hierarchical voting systems
provide a reasonable alternative. We study differences in outcome precision
between hierarchical and direct voting systems for varying group sizes,
abstention rates, and voter competencies. Using asymptotic expansions of the
derivative of the reliability function (or Banzhaf number), we first prove that
indirect systems differ most from their direct counterparts when group size and
number are equal to each other, and therefore to $\sqrt{N_{\rm d}}$, where
$N_{\rm d}$ is the total number of voters in the direct system. In multitier
systems, we prove that this difference is maximized when group size equals
$\sqrt[n]{N_{\rm d}}$, where $n$ is the number of hierarchical levels. Second,
we show that while direct majority rule always outperforms hierarchical voting
for homogeneous electorates that vote with certainty, as group numbers and size
increase, hierarchical majority voting gains in its ability to represent all
eligible voters. Furthermore, when voter abstention and competency are
correlated within groups, hierarchical systems often outperform direct voting,
which we show by using a generating function approach that is able to
analytically characterize heterogeneous voting systems.",2110.02298v1,math.CO,2021-10-05 19:01:52+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Lucas Böttcher'), arxiv.Result.Author('Georgia Kernell')]","Collect. Intell. 1, 1--16 (2022)"
3,The distortion of distributed voting,"Voting can abstractly model any decision-making scenario and as such it has
been extensively studied over the decades. Recently, the related literature has
focused on quantifying the impact of utilizing only limited information in the
voting process on the societal welfare for the outcome, by bounding the
distortion of voting rules. Even though there has been significant progress
towards this goal, all previous works have so far neglected the fact that in
many scenarios (like presidential elections) voting is actually a distributed
procedure. In this paper, we consider a setting in which the voters are
partitioned into disjoint districts and vote locally therein to elect local
winning alternatives using a voting rule; the final outcome is then chosen from
the set of these alternatives. We prove tight bounds on the distortion of
well-known voting rules for such distributed elections both from a worst-case
perspective as well as from a best-case one. Our results indicate that the
partition of voters into districts leads to considerably higher distortion, a
phenomenon which we also experimentally showcase using real-world data.",1905.01882v2,cs.GT,2019-05-06 08:42:46+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Aris Filos-Ratsikas'), arxiv.Result.Author('Evi Micha'), arxiv.Result.Author('Alexandros A. Voudouris')]",
4,Heuristic Strategies in Uncertain Approval Voting Environments,"In many collective decision making situations, agents vote to choose an
alternative that best represents the preferences of the group. Agents may
manipulate the vote to achieve a better outcome by voting in a way that does
not reflect their true preferences. In real world voting scenarios, people
often do not have complete information about other voter preferences and it can
be computationally complex to identify a strategy that will maximize their
expected utility. In such situations, it is often assumed that voters will vote
truthfully rather than expending the effort to strategize. However, being
truthful is just one possible heuristic that may be used. In this paper, we
examine the effectiveness of heuristics in single winner and multi-winner
approval voting scenarios with missing votes. In particular, we look at
heuristics where a voter ignores information about other voting profiles and
makes their decisions based solely on how much they like each candidate. In a
behavioral experiment, we show that people vote truthfully in some situations
and prioritize high utility candidates in others. We examine when these
behaviors maximize expected utility and show how the structure of the voting
environment affects both how well each heuristic performs and how humans employ
these heuristics.",1912.00011v1,cs.GT,2019-11-29 13:38:34+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Jaelle Scheuerman'), arxiv.Result.Author('Jason L. Harman'), arxiv.Result.Author('Nicholas Mattei'), arxiv.Result.Author('K. Brent Venable')]",
5,The vote Package: Single Transferable Vote and Other Electoral Systems in R,"We describe the vote package in R, which implements the plurality (or
first-past-the-post), two-round runoff, score, approval and single transferable
vote (STV) electoral systems, as well as methods for selecting the Condorcet
winner and loser. We emphasize the STV system, which we have found to work well
in practice for multi-winner elections with small electorates, such as
committee and council elections, and the selection of multiple job candidates.
For single-winner elections, the STV is also called instant runoff voting
(IRV), ranked choice voting (RCV), or the alternative vote (AV) system. The
package also implements the STV system with equal preferences, for the first
time in a software package, to our knowledge. It also implements a new variant
of STV, in which a minimum number of candidates from a specified group are
required to be elected. We illustrate the package with several real examples.",2102.05801v1,stat.CO,2021-02-11 01:50:46+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Adrian E. Raftery'), arxiv.Result.Author('Hana Ševčíková'), arxiv.Result.Author('Bernard W. Silverman')]",
6,Security Requirement Analysis of Blockchain-based E-Voting Systems,"In democratic countries such as India, voting is a fundamental right given to
citizens of their countries. Citizens need to physically present and cast their
vote in ballot-paper-based voting systems. Most of the citizens fail to fulfill
this constraint and have stayed away from their fundamental duty.
Electronic-voting systems are often considered one efficient alternative in
such situations. Blockchain Technology is an emerging technology that can
provide a real solution as it is characterized by immutable, transparent,
anonymous, and decentralized properties. This paper presents a security
requirement analysis for e-voting systems and evaluates blockchain technology
against these requirements.",2208.01277v1,cs.CR,2022-08-02 06:55:25+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Sanil S. Gandhi'), arxiv.Result.Author('Arvind W. Kiwelekar'), arxiv.Result.Author('Laxman D. Netak'), arxiv.Result.Author('Hansraj S. Wankhede')]",
7,Phrase-Verified Voting: Verifiable Low-Tech Remote Boardroom Voting,"We present Phrase-Verified Voting, a voter-verifiable remote voting system
assembled from commercial off-the-shelf software for small private elections.
The system is transparent and enables each voter to verify that the tally
includes their ballot selection without requiring any understanding of
cryptography. This paper describes the system and its use in fall 2020, to vote
remotely in promotion committees in a university. Each voter fills out a form
in the cloud with their vote V (YES, NO, ABSTAIN) and a passphrase P-two words
entered by the voter. The system generates a verification prompt of the (P,V)
pairs and a tally of the votes, organized to help visualize how the votes add
up. After the polls close, each voter verifies that this table lists their
(P,V) pair and that the tally is computed correctly. The system is especially
appropriate for any small group making sensitive decisions. Because the system
would not prevent a coercer from demanding that their victim use a specified
passphrase, it is not designed for applications where such malfeasance would be
likely or go undetected. Results from 43 voters show that the system was
well-accepted, performed effectively for its intended purpose, and introduced
users to the concept of voter-verified elections. Compared to the commonly-used
alternatives of paper ballots or voting by email, voters found the system
easier to use, and that it provided greater privacy and outcome integrity.",2103.07180v1,cs.CR,2021-03-12 09:59:55+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Enka Blanchard'), arxiv.Result.Author('Ryan Robucci'), arxiv.Result.Author('Ted Selker'), arxiv.Result.Author('Alan Sherman')]",

places, insufficient DRE numbers in combination with lengthy ballots and high
voter traffic have caused long lines and disenfranchised voters who left
without voting. We have applied computer queuing simulation to the voting
process and conclude that far more DREs, at great expense, would be needed to
keep waiting times low. Alternatively, paper ballot-optical scan systems can be
easily and economically scaled to prevent long lines and meet unexpected
contingencies.",0810.5577v1,stat.AP,2008-10-30 20:57:19+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('William A. Edelstein'), arxiv.Result.Author('Arthur D. Edelstein')]",
9,Manipulative Elicitation -- A New Attack on Elections with Incomplete Preferences,"Lu and Boutilier proposed a novel approach based on ""minimax regret"" to use
classical score based voting rules in the setting where preferences can be any
partial (instead of complete) orders over the set of alternatives. We show here
that such an approach is vulnerable to a new kind of manipulation which was not
present in the classical (where preferences are complete orders) world of
voting. We call this attack ""manipulative elicitation."" More specifically, it
may be possible to (partially) elicit the preferences of the agents in a way
that makes some distinguished alternative win the election who may not be a
winner if we elicit every preference completely. More alarmingly, we show that
the related computational task is polynomial time solvable for a large class of
voting rules which includes all scoring rules, maximin, Copeland$^\alpha$ for
every $\alpha\in[0,1]$, simplified Bucklin voting rules, etc. We then show that
introducing a parameter per pair of alternatives which specifies the minimum
number of partial preferences where this pair of alternatives must be
comparable makes the related computational task of manipulative elicitation
\NPC for all common voting rules including a class of scoring rules which
includes the plurality, $k$-approval, $k$-veto, veto, and Borda voting rules,
maximin, Copeland$^\alpha$ for every $\alpha\in[0,1]$, and simplified Bucklin
voting rules. Hence, in this work, we discover a fundamental vulnerability in
using minimax regret based approach in partial preferential setting and propose
a novel way to tackle it.",1711.03948v1,cs.MA,2017-11-10 18:21:05+00:00,[arxiv.Result.Author('Palash Dey')],
10,Arrovian juntas,"This article explicitly constructs and classifies all arrovian voting systems

of course, Arrow's classical dictator theorem, and a closer look reveals the
classification of all such voting systems as dictatorial hierarchies. If we
leave the traditional realm of complete orderings, the picture changes. Here we
consider the more general setting where alternatives may be incomparable, that
is, we allow orderings that are reflexive and transitive but not necessarily
complete. Instead of a dictator we exhibit a junta whose internal hierarchy or
coalition structure can be surprisingly rich. We give an explicit description
of all such voting systems, generalizing and unifying various previous results.",math/0608270v1,math.CO,2006-08-10 20:59:48+00:00,[arxiv.Result.Author('Michael Eisermann')],
11,Determining Possible and Necessary Winners Given Partial Orders,"Usually a voting rule requires agents to give their preferences as linear
orders. However, in some cases it is impractical for an agent to give a linear
order over all the alternatives. It has been suggested to let agents submit
partial orders instead. Then, given a voting rule, a profile of partial orders,
and an alternative (candidate) c, two important questions arise: first, is it
still possible for c to win, and second, is c guaranteed to win? These are the
possible winner and necessary winner problems, respectively. Each of these two
problems is further divided into two sub-problems: determining whether c is a
unique winner (that is, c is the only winner), or determining whether c is a
co-winner (that is, c is in the set of winners). We consider the setting where
the number of alternatives is unbounded and the votes are unweighted. We
completely characterize the complexity of possible/necessary winner problems
for the following common voting rules: a class of positional scoring rules
(including Borda), Copeland, maximin, Bucklin, ranked pairs, voting trees, and
plurality with runoff.",1401.3876v1,cs.GT,2014-01-16 05:10:45+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Lirong Xia'), arxiv.Result.Author('Vincent Conitzer')]","Journal Of Artificial Intelligence Research, Volume 41, pages

12,Unravelling multi-agent ranked delegations,"We introduce a voting model with multi-agent ranked delegations. This model
generalises liquid democracy in two aspects: first, an agent's delegation can
use the votes of multiple other agents to determine their own -- for instance,
an agent's vote may correspond to the majority outcome of the votes of a
trusted group of agents; second, agents can submit a ranking over multiple
delegations, so that a backup delegation can be used when their preferred
delegations are involved in cycles. The main focus of this paper is the study
of unravelling procedures that transform the delegation ballots received from
the agents into a profile of direct votes, from which a winning alternative can
then be determined by using a standard voting rule. We propose and study six
such unravelling procedures, two based on optimisation and four using a greedy
approach. We study both algorithmic and axiomatic properties, as well as
related computational complexity problems of our unravelling procedures for
different restrictions on the types of ballots that the agents can submit.",2111.13145v1,cs.AI,2021-11-25 15:58:39+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Rachael Colley'), arxiv.Result.Author('Umberto Grandi'), arxiv.Result.Author('Arianna Novaro')]",
13,Paradoxes in Sequential Voting,"We analyse strategic, complete information, sequential voting with ordinal
preferences over the alternatives. We consider several voting mechanisms:
plurality voting and approval voting with deterministic or uniform tie-breaking
rules. We show that strategic voting in these voting procedures may lead to a
very undesirable outcome: Condorcet winning alternative might be rejected,
Condorcet losing alternative might be elected, and Pareto dominated alternative
might be elected. These undesirable phenomena occur already with four
alternatives and a small number of voters. For the case of three alternatives
we present positive and negative results.",1807.03979v2,cs.GT,2018-07-11 07:50:42+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Oren Dean'), arxiv.Result.Author('Yakov Babichenko'), arxiv.Result.Author('Moshe Tennenholtz')]",

serious concerns on the efficiency of the current voting system in representing
the people's will. Is the naive Plurality voting suitable in an extremely
polarized political environment? Alternate voting schemes are gradually gaining
public support, wherein the voters rank their choices instead of just voting
for their first preference. However they do not capture certain crucial aspects
of voter preferences like disapprovals and negativities against candidates. I
argue that these unexpressed negativities are the predominant source of
polarization in politics. I propose a voting scheme with an explicit expression
of these negative preferences, so that we can simultaneously decipher the
popularity as well as the polarity of each candidate. The winner is picked by
an optimal tradeoff between the most popular and the least polarizing
candidate. By penalizing the candidates for their polarization, we can
discourage the divisive campaign rhetorics and pave way for potential third
party candidates.",2012.13657v1,econ.TH,2020-12-26 01:05:24+00:00,[arxiv.Result.Author('Karthik H. Shankar')],
15,Obvious Manipulability of Voting Rules,"The Gibbard-Satterthwaite theorem states that no unanimous and
non-dictatorial voting rule is strategyproof. We revisit voting rules and
consider a weaker notion of strategyproofness called not obvious manipulability
that was proposed by Troyan and Morrill (2020). We identify several classes of
voting rules that satisfy this notion. We also show that several voting rules
including k-approval fail to satisfy this property. We characterize conditions
under which voting rules are obviously manipulable. One of our insights is that
certain rules are obviously manipulable when the number of alternatives is
relatively large compared to the number of voters. In contrast to the
Gibbard-Satterthwaite theorem, many of the rules we examined are not obviously
manipulable. This reflects the relatively easier satisfiability of the notion
and the zero information assumption of not obvious manipulability, as opposed
to the perfect information assumption of strategyproofness. We also present
algorithmic results for computing obvious manipulations and report on
experiments.",2111.01983v3,cs.GT,2021-11-03 02:41:48+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Haris Aziz'), arxiv.Result.Author('Alexander Lam')]",
16,A Blockchain-based Self-tallying Voting Scheme in Decentralized IoT,"The Internet of Things (IoT) is experiencing explosive growth and has gained
extensive attention from academia and industry in recent years. Most of the
existing IoT infrastructures are centralized, in which the presence of a cloud
server is mandatory. However, centralized frameworks suffer from the issues of
unscalability and single-point-of-failure. Consequently, decentralized IoT has
been proposed by taking advantage of the emerging technology of Blockchain.
Voting systems are widely adopted in IoT, such as a leader election in wireless
sensor networks. Self-tallying voting systems are alternatives to traditional
centralized voting systems in decentralized IoT since the traditional ones are
not suitable for such scenarios. Unfortunately, self-tallying voting systems
inherently suffer from fairness issues, such as adaptive and abortive issues
caused by malicious voters. In this paper, we introduce a framework of
self-tallying systems in decentralized IoT based on Blockchain. We propose a
concrete construction and prove the proposed system satisfies all the security
requirements including fairness, dispute-freeness and maximal ballot secrecy.

performing that case of control is computationally infeasible. Range Voting is
a natural extension of approval voting, and Normalized Range Voting is a simple
variant which alters each vote to maximize the potential impact of each voter.
We show that Normalized Range Voting has among the largest number of control

19,Plurality Voting under Uncertainty,"Understanding the nature of strategic voting is the holy grail of social
choice theory, where game-theory, social science and recently computational
approaches are all applied in order to model the incentives and behavior of
voters.
  In a recent paper, Meir et al.[EC'14] made another step in this direction, by
suggesting a behavioral game-theoretic model for voters under uncertainty. For
a specific variation of best-response heuristics, they proved initial existence
and convergence results in the Plurality voting system.
  In this paper, we extend the model in multiple directions, considering voters
with different uncertainty levels, simultaneous strategic decisions, and a more
permissive notion of best-response. We prove that a voting equilibrium exists
even in the most general case. Further, any society voting in an iterative
setting is guaranteed to converge.
  We also analyze an alternative behavior where voters try to minimize their
worst-case regret. We show that the two behaviors coincide in the simple
setting of Meir et al., but not in the general case.",1411.4949v1,cs.MA,2014-11-18 18:14:25+00:00,[arxiv.Result.Author('Reshef Meir')],
20,Ballot Length in Instant Runoff Voting,"Instant runoff voting (IRV) is an increasingly-popular alternative to
traditional plurality voting in which voters submit rankings over the
candidates rather than single votes. In practice, elections using IRV often
restrict the ballot length, the number of candidates a voter is allowed to rank
on their ballot. We theoretically and empirically analyze how ballot length can
influence the outcome of an election, given fixed voter preferences. We show
that there exist preference profiles over $k$ candidates such that up to $k-1$
different candidates win at different ballot lengths. We derive exact lower
bounds on the number of voters required for such profiles and provide a
construction matching the lower bound for unrestricted voter preferences.
Additionally, we characterize which sequences of winners are possible over
ballot lengths and provide explicit profile constructions achieving any
feasible winner sequence. We also examine how classic preference restrictions
influence our results--for instance, single-peakedness makes $k-1$ different
winners impossible but still allows at least $\Omega(\sqrt k)$. Finally, we
analyze a collection of 168 real-world elections, where we truncate rankings to
simulate shorter ballots. We find that shorter ballots could have changed the
outcome in one quarter of these elections. Our results highlight ballot length
as a consequential degree of freedom in the design of IRV elections.",2207.08958v3,cs.MA,2022-07-18 22:01:13+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Kiran Tomlinson'), arxiv.Result.Author('Johan Ugander'), arxiv.Result.Author('Jon Kleinberg')]",

number of odd order permutations with $M(\pi)=d$, where $M(\pi)$ is a certain
statistic related to the cyclic descents of $\pi$. We conjecture that

25,Limiting Risk by Turning Manifest Phantoms into Evil Zombies,"Drawing a random sample of ballots to conduct a risk-limiting audit generally
requires knowing how the ballots cast in an election are organized into groups,
for instance, how many containers of ballots there are in all and how many
ballots are in each container. A list of the ballot group identifiers along
with number of ballots in each group is called a ballot manifest. What if the
ballot manifest is not accurate? Surprisingly, even if ballots are known to be
missing from the manifest, it is not necessary to make worst-case assumptions
about those ballots--for instance, to adjust the margin by the number of
missing ballots--to ensure that the audit remains conservative. Rather, it
suffices to make worst-case assumptions about the individual randomly selected
ballots that the audit cannot find. This observation provides a simple
modification to some risk-limiting audit procedures that makes them
automatically become more conservative if the ballot manifest has errors. The
modification--phantoms to evil zombies (~2EZ)--requires only an upper bound on
the total number of ballots cast. ~2EZ makes the audit P-value stochastically
larger than it would be had the manifest been accurate, automatically requiring
more than enough ballots to be audited to offset the manifest errors. This
ensures that the true risk limit remains smaller than the nominal risk limit.
On the other hand, if the manifest is in fact accurate and the upper bound on
the total number of ballots equals the total according to the manifest, ~2EZ
has no effect at all on the number of ballots audited nor on the true risk
limit.",1207.3413v1,stat.AP,2012-07-14 11:26:02+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Jorge H. Banuelos'), arxiv.Result.Author('Philip B. Stark')]",

setting where votes consist of approval ballots: each voter approves a set of
alternatives which they believe can possibly be the ground truth. Based on the
intuitive idea that more reliable votes contain fewer alternatives, we define
several noise models that are approval voting variants of the Mallows model.
The likelihood-maximizing alternative is then characterized as the winner of a
weighted approval rule, where the weight of a ballot decreases with its
cardinality. We have conducted an experiment on three image annotation
datasets; they conclude that rules based on our noise model outperform standard
approval voting; the best performance is obtained by a variant of the Condorcet
noise model.",2112.04387v1,cs.GT,2021-12-07 12:29:49+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Tahar Allouche'), arxiv.Result.Author('Jérôme Lang'), arxiv.Result.Author('Florian Yger')]",

relations and formulas, which leads to an interesting bijection between ballot
permutations avoiding $132$ and $312$ with left factors of Dyck paths. In

28,Can Voters Detect Errors on Their Printed Ballots? Absolutely,"There is still debate on whether voters can detect malicious changes in their
printed ballot after making their selections on a Ballot Marking Device (BMD).
In this study, we altered votes on a voter's ballot after they had made their
selections on a BMD. We then required them to examine their ballots for any
changes from the slate they used to vote. Overall accuracy was exceptionally
high. Participants saw 1440 total contests, and of those 1440, there were a
total of 4 errors, so total accuracy was 99.8%. Participants were able to
perform with near-perfect accuracy regardless of ballot length, ballot type,
number of altered races, and location of altered races. Detection performance
was extremely robust. We conclude that with proper direction and resources,
voters can be near-perfect detectors of ballot changes on printed paper ballots
after voting with a BMD. This finding has significant implications for the
voting community as BMD use continues to grow. Research should now focus on
identifying administrative and behavioral methods that will prompt and
encourage voters to check their BMD-generated ballots before they drop them in
the ballot box.",2204.09780v1,cs.HC,2022-04-20 20:40:32+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Philip Kortum'), arxiv.Result.Author('Michael D. Byrne'), arxiv.Result.Author('Chidera O. Azubike'), arxiv.Result.Author('Laura E. Roty')]",

generalises liquid democracy in two aspects: first, an agent's delegation can
use the votes of multiple other agents to determine their own -- for instance,
an agent's vote may correspond to the majority outcome of the votes of a
trusted group of agents; second, agents can submit a ranking over multiple
delegations, so that a backup delegation can be used when their preferred
delegations are involved in cycles. The main focus of this paper is the study
of unravelling procedures that transform the delegation ballots received from
the agents into a profile of direct votes, from which a winning alternative can
then be determined by using a standard voting rule. We propose and study six
such unravelling procedures, two based on optimisation and four using a greedy
approach. We study both algorithmic and axiomatic properties, as well as
related computational complexity problems of our unravelling procedures for
different restrictions on the types of ballots that the agents can submit.",2111.13145v1,cs.AI,2021-11-25 15:58:39+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Rachael Colley'), arxiv.Result.Author('Umberto Grandi'), arxiv.Result.Author('Arianna Novaro')]",

cycle-resolving rule, dubbed Split Cycle: in each majority cycle, discard the
majority preferences with the smallest majority margin. They showed that any
rule satisfying five standard axioms, plus a weakening of Arrow's Independence
of Irrelevant Alternatives (IIA) called Coherent IIA, is refined by Split
Cycle. In this paper, we go further and show that Split Cycle is the only rule
satisfying the axioms of Holliday and Pacuit together with two additional
axioms: Coherent Defeat and Positive Involvement in Defeat. Coherent Defeat
states that any majority preference not occurring in a cycle is retained, while
Positive Involvement in Defeat is closely related to the well-known axiom of
Positive Involvement (as in J. P\'{e}rez, Social Choice and Welfare 18 (2001)

also as a social choice correspondence, over both profiles of linear ballots

malevolent adversary trying to buy real ballots. If the citizenry is divided
into subgroups (or districts), the adversary can construct a so-called ""Devil's
Menu"" consisting of several prices. In equilibrium, the adversary can buy the
real ballots of any strict subset of districts at a price corresponding to the
willingness to sell on the part of the citizens holding such ballots. By
contrast, decoy voters are trapped into selling their ballots at a low, or even
negligible, price. Blowing up the adversary's budget by introducing decoy
ballots may thus turn out to be futile. The Devil's Menu can also be applied to
the well-known ""Lemons Problem"".",1712.05477v1,cs.GT,2017-12-14 23:54:58+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Hans Gersbach'), arxiv.Result.Author('Akaki Mamageishvili'), arxiv.Result.Author('Oriol Tejada')]",
35,The ATHENA Class of Risk-Limiting Ballot Polling Audits,"The main risk-limiting ballot polling audit in use today, BRAVO, is designed
for use when single ballots are drawn at random and a decision regarding
whether to stop the audit or draw another ballot is taken after each ballot
draw (ballot-by-ballot (B2) audits). On the other hand, real ballot polling
audits draw many ballots in a single round before determining whether to stop
(round-by-round (R2) audits). We show that BRAVO results in significant
inefficiency when directly applied to real R2 audits. We present the ATHENA
class of R2 stopping rules, which we show are risk-limiting if the round
schedule is pre-determined (before the audit begins). We prove that each rule
is at least as efficient as the corresponding BRAVO stopping rule applied at
the end of the round. We have open-source software libraries implementing most
of our results.
  We show that ATHENA halves the number of ballots required, for all state
margins in the 2016 US Presidential election and a first round with $90\%$
stopping probability, when compared to BRAVO (stopping rule applied at the end
of the round). We present simulation results supporting the 90% stopping
probability claims and our claims for the risk accrued in the first round.
Further, ATHENA reduces the number of ballots by more than a quarter for low
margins, when compared to the BRAVO stopping rule applied on ballots in
selection order. This implies that keeping track of the order when drawing
ballots R2 is not beneficial, because ATHENA is more efficient even without
information on selection order. These results are significant because current
approaches to real ballot polling election audits use the B2 BRAVO rules,
requiring about twice as much work on the part of election officials. Applying
the rules in selection order requires fewer ballots, but keeping track of the
order, and entering it into audit software, adds to the effort.",2008.02315v5,cs.CR,2020-08-05 18:47:37+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Filip Zagórski'), arxiv.Result.Author('Grant McClearn'), arxiv.Result.Author('Sarah Morin'), arxiv.Result.Author('Neal McBurnett'), arxiv.Result.Author('Poorvi L.

36,Visibilities and bolometric corrections for stellar oscillation modes observed by Kepler,"Kepler produces a large amount of data used for asteroseismological analyses,
particularly of solar-like stars and red giants. The mode amplitudes observed
in the Kepler spectral band have to be converted into bolometric amplitudes to
be compared to models. We give a simple bolometric correction for the
amplitudes of radial modes observed with Kepler, as well as the relative
visibilities of non-radial modes. We numerically compute the bolometric
correction c_{K-bol} and mode visibilities for different effective temperatures
Teff within the range 4000-7500 K, using a similar approach to a recent one
from the literature (Michel et al. 2009, A&A 495, 979). We derive a law for the
correction to bolometric values: c_{K-bol} = 1 + a_1 (Teff-To) + a_2
(Teff-To)^2, with To = 5934 K, a_1 = 1.349e-4 K^{-1}, and a_2 = -3.120e-9
K^{-2} or, alternatively, as the power law c_{K-bol} = (Teff/To)^alpha with
alpha = 0.80. We give tabulated values for the mode visibilities based on
limb-darkening (LD), computed from ATLAS9 model atmospheres for Teff in
[4000,7500] K, log g in [2.5,4.5], and [M/H] in [-1.0,+1.0]. We show that using

The system is transparent and enables each voter to verify that the tally

cryptography. This paper describes the system and its use in fall 2020, to vote
remotely in promotion committees in a university. Each voter fills out a form
in the cloud with their vote V (YES, NO, ABSTAIN) and a passphrase P-two words
entered by the voter. The system generates a verification prompt of the (P,V)
pairs and a tally of the votes, organized to help visualize how the votes add
up. After the polls close, each voter verifies that this table lists their
(P,V) pair and that the tally is computed correctly. The system is especially
appropriate for any small group making sensitive decisions. Because the system
would not prevent a coercer from demanding that their victim use a specified
passphrase, it is not designed for applications where such malfeasance would be
likely or go undetected. Results from 43 voters show that the system was
well-accepted, performed effectively for its intended purpose, and introduced

Our method involves doing $k$ ""cuts"", each involving moving a random portion of
ballots from the top to the bottom of the stack, and then picking the ballot on
top. Unlike conventional methods of picking a ballot at random, $k$-cut does
not require identification numbers on the ballots or counting many ballots per
draw. We analyze how close the distribution of chosen ballots is to the uniform
distribution, and design different mitigation procedures. We show that $k=6$

41,Power-Efficient Direct-Voting Assurance for Data Fusion in Wireless Sensor Networks,"Wireless sensor networks place sensors into an area to collect data and send
them back to a base station. Data fusion, which fuses the collected data before
they are sent to the base station, is usually implemented over the network.
Since the sensor is typically placed in locations accessible to malicious
attackers, information assurance of the data fusion process is very important.
A witness-based approach has been proposed to validate the fusion data. In this
approach, the base station receives the fusion data and ""votes"" on the data
from a randomly chosen sensor node. The vote comes from other sensor nodes,
called ""witnesses,"" to verify the correctness of the fusion data. Because the
base station obtains the vote through the chosen node, the chosen node could
forge the vote if it is compromised. Thus, the witness node must encrypt the
vote to prevent this forgery. Compared with the vote, the encryption requires
more bits, increasing transmission burden from the chosen node to the base
station. The chosen node consumes more power. This work improves the
witness-based approach using direct voting mechanism such that the proposed
scheme has better performance in terms of assurance, overhead, and delay. The
witness node transmits the vote directly to the base station. Forgery is not a
problem in this scheme. Moreover, fewer bits are necessary to represent the
vote, significantly reducing the power consumption. Performance analysis and
simulation results indicate that the proposed approach can achieve a 40 times
better overhead than the witness-based approach.",0705.3683v1,cs.CR,2007-05-25 02:56:47+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('H. -T. Pai'), arxiv.Result.Author('Y. S. Han')]",

polling stations. Voting information is gathered gradually, often with no
guarantee of obtaining the complete sample or even information in all the
strata. However, accurate interval estimates with partial information must be
obtained. Furthermore, this becomes more challenging if the strata are
additionally study domains. To produce partial estimates, two strategies are
proposed: 1) A Bayesian model using a dynamic post-stratification strategy and
a single imputation process defined after a thorough analysis of historic
voting information. Additionally, a credibility level correction is included to
solve the underestimation of the variance; 2) a frequentist alternative that
combines standard multiple imputation ideas with classic sampling techniques to
obtain estimates under a missing information framework. Both solutions are
illustrated and compared using information from the 2021 quick count. The aim

the preferred alternative of the majority with high prob- ability, and that
average costs will be low. This result is in contrast with the literature on

45,Toward the Evaluation of Written Proficiency on a Collaborative Social Network for Learning Languages: Yask,"Yask is an online social collaborative network for practicing languages in a
framework that includes requests, answers, and votes. Since measuring
linguistic competence using current approaches is difficult, expensive and in
many cases imprecise, we present a new alternative approach based on social
networks. Our method, called Proficiency Rank, extends the well-known Page Rank
algorithm to measure the reputation of users in a collaborative social graph.
First, we extended Page Rank so that it not only considers positive links
(votes) but also negative links. Second, in addition to using explicit links,
we also incorporate other 4 types of signals implicit in the social graph.
These extensions allow Proficiency Rank to produce proficiency rankings for
almost all users in the data set used, where only a minority contributes by
answering, while the majority contributes only by voting. This overcomes the
intrinsic limitation of Page Rank of only being able to rank the nodes that
have incoming links. Our experimental validation showed that the
reputation/importance of the users in Yask is significantly correlated with
their language proficiency. In contrast, their written production was poorly
correlated with the vocabulary profiles of the Common European Framework of
Reference. In addition, we found that negative signals (votes) are considerably
more informative than positive ones. We concluded that the use of this

winning alternative. Selection of a winner is accomplished via a voting rule,

voting rule should be used? In social choice theory, desirable properties of
voting rules are expressed as axioms to be satisfied. This thesis focuses on
axioms concerning strategic manipulation by voters. Sometimes, voters may
intentionally misstate their true preferences in order to alter the outcome for
their own advantage. For example, in plurality rule, if a voter knows that
their top-choice candidate will lose, then they might instead vote for their
second-choice candidate just to avoid an even less desirable result. When no
coalition of voters can strategically manipulate, then the voting rule is said
to satisfy the axiom of Strategy-Proofness. A less restrictive axiom is Weak
Strategy-Proofness (as defined by Dasgupta and Maskin (2019)), which allows for
strategic manipulation by all but the smallest coalitions. Under certain
intuitive conditions, Dasgupta and Maskin (2019) proved that the only voting
rules satisfying Strategy-Proofness are rank-order voting and majority rule. In

paramount importance, making voting a key element of societal mechanisms. One

intuitiveness, also conceptually quite appealing is Charles Dodgson's scoring
rule, basically using the respective closeness to being a Condorcet winner for
evaluating competing alternatives. In this paper, we offer insights on the

theorem: if we fix the number of alternatives, generate $n$ votes i.i.d.

$\epsilon >0$, with probability at least $1-\epsilon$, the minimum number of
operations that are needed for the strategic individual to achieve her goal
falls into one of the following four categories: (1) 0, (2) $\Theta(\sqrt n)$,
(3) $\Theta(n)$, and (4) $\infty$. This theorem holds for any set of vote
operations, any individual vote distribution $\pi$, and any integer generalized
scoring rule, which includes (but is not limited to) almost all commonly
studied voting rules, e.g., approval voting, all positional scoring rules

been based on traditional machine learning approaches or time series modelling.
We propose here an alternate approach based on deep learning algorithms for
forecasting strawberry yields and prices in Santa Barbara county, California.
Building the proposed forecasting model comprises three stages: first, the
station-based ensemble model (ATT-CNN-LSTM-SeriesNet_Ens) with its compound
deep learning components, SeriesNet with Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) and
Convolutional Neural Network LSTM with Attention layer (Att-CNN-LSTM), are
trained and tested using the station-based soil temperature and moisture data
of SantaBarbara as input and the corresponding strawberry yields or prices as
output. Secondly, the remote sensing ensemble model (SIM_CNN-LSTM_Ens), which
is an ensemble model of Convolutional NeuralNetwork LSTM (CNN-LSTM) models, is
trained and tested using satellite images of the same county as input mapped to
the same yields and prices as output. These two ensembles forecast strawberry
yields and prices with minimal forecasting errors and highest model correlation
for five weeks ahead forecasts.Finally, the forecasts of these two models are
ensembled to have a final forecasted value for yields and prices by introducing
a voting ensemble. Based on an aggregated performance measure (AGM), it is
found that this voting ensemble not only enhances the forecasting performance
by 5% compared to its best performing component model but also outperforms the
Deep Learning (DL) ensemble model found in literature by 33% for forecasting
yields and 21% for forecasting prices",2102.09024v1,cs.LG,2021-02-17 20:54:34+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Mohita Chaudhary'), arxiv.Result.Author('Mohamed Sadok Gastli'), arxiv.Result.Author('Lobna Nassar'), arxiv.Result.Author('Fakhri Karray')]","AAAI 2021 Spring Symposium on Combining Machine Learning and

many scenarios (like presidential elections) voting is actually a distributed
procedure. In this paper, we consider a setting in which the voters are
partitioned into disjoint districts and vote locally therein to elect local
winning alternatives using a voting rule; the final outcome is then chosen from
the set of these alternatives. We prove tight bounds on the distortion of

partition of voters into districts leads to considerably higher distortion, a

delegation favors minorities, that is, alternatives that have a lower chance of
winning ex-ante. The same occurs if the number of voting rights that actual
voters can have is capped. When the number of delegators increases, the
probability that the ex-ante minority wins under free and capped delegation
converges to the one under conventional voting--albeit non-monotonically. Our
results are obtained in a private value setting but can be readily translated
into an information aggregation setting when voters receive a signal about the

heuristics where a voter ignores information about other voting profiles and

majority voting systems with sufficiently large electorates as long as each
voter's independent probability of voting for that outcome is greater than 0.5.
Yet, in situations where direct voting systems are infeasible, such as due to
high implementation and infrastructure costs, hierarchical voting systems
provide a reasonable alternative. We study differences in outcome precision
between hierarchical and direct voting systems for varying group sizes,
abstention rates, and voter competencies. Using asymptotic expansions of the
derivative of the reliability function (or Banzhaf number), we first prove that
indirect systems differ most from their direct counterparts when group size and
number are equal to each other, and therefore to $\sqrt{N_{\rm d}}$, where
$N_{\rm d}$ is the total number of voters in the direct system. In multitier
systems, we prove that this difference is maximized when group size equals
$\sqrt[n]{N_{\rm d}}$, where $n$ is the number of hierarchical levels. Second,
we show that while direct majority rule always outperforms hierarchical voting
for homogeneous electorates that vote with certainty, as group numbers and size
increase, hierarchical majority voting gains in its ability to represent all
eligible voters. Furthermore, when voter abstention and competency are
correlated within groups, hierarchical systems often outperform direct voting,
which we show by using a generating function approach that is able to
analytically characterize heterogeneous voting systems.",2110.02298v1,math.CO,2021-10-05 19:01:52+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Lucas Böttcher'), arxiv.Result.Author('Georgia Kernell')]","Collect. Intell. 1, 1--16 (2022)"

pairs and a tally of the votes, organized to help visualize how the votes add
up. After the polls close, each voter verifies that this table lists their
(P,V) pair and that the tally is computed correctly. The system is especially
appropriate for any small group making sensitive decisions. Because the system
would not prevent a coercer from demanding that their victim use a specified
passphrase, it is not designed for applications where such malfeasance would be
likely or go undetected. Results from 43 voters show that the system was

and an alternative (candidate) c, two important questions arise: first, is it
still possible for c to win, and second, is c guaranteed to win? These are the
possible winner and necessary winner problems, respectively. Each of these two
problems is further divided into two sub-problems: determining whether c is a
unique winner (that is, c is the only winner), or determining whether c is a
co-winner (that is, c is in the set of winners). We consider the setting where

an agent's vote may correspond to the majority outcome of the votes of a
trusted group of agents; second, agents can submit a ranking over multiple
delegations, so that a backup delegation can be used when their preferred
delegations are involved in cycles. The main focus of this paper is the study
of unravelling procedures that transform the delegation ballots received from
the agents into a profile of direct votes, from which a winning alternative can
then be determined by using a standard voting rule. We propose and study six

public support, wherein the voters rank their choices instead of just voting
for their first preference. However they do not capture certain crucial aspects

argue that these unexpressed negativities are the predominant source of
polarization in politics. I propose a voting scheme with an explicit expression
of these negative preferences, so that we can simultaneously decipher the
popularity as well as the polarity of each candidate. The winner is picked by
an optimal tradeoff between the most popular and the least polarizing

under which voting rules are obviously manipulable. One of our insights is that
certain rules are obviously manipulable when the number of alternatives is
relatively large compared to the number of voters. In contrast to the
Gibbard-Satterthwaite theorem, many of the rules we examined are not obviously
manipulable. This reflects the relatively easier satisfiability of the notion

76,A Blockchain-based Self-tallying Voting Scheme in Decentralized IoT,"The Internet of Things (IoT) is experiencing explosive growth and has gained

been proposed by taking advantage of the emerging technology of Blockchain.
Voting systems are widely adopted in IoT, such as a leader election in wireless
sensor networks. Self-tallying voting systems are alternatives to traditional
centralized voting systems in decentralized IoT since the traditional ones are

79,Plurality Voting under Uncertainty,"Understanding the nature of strategic voting is the holy grail of social
choice theory, where game-theory, social science and recently computational

voters.
  In a recent paper, Meir et al.[EC'14] made another step in this direction, by
suggesting a behavioral game-theoretic model for voters under uncertainty. For
a specific variation of best-response heuristics, they proved initial existence
and convergence results in the Plurality voting system.
  In this paper, we extend the model in multiple directions, considering voters
with different uncertainty levels, simultaneous strategic decisions, and a more
permissive notion of best-response. We prove that a voting equilibrium exists
even in the most general case. Further, any society voting in an iterative
setting is guaranteed to converge.
  We also analyze an alternative behavior where voters try to minimize their
worst-case regret. We show that the two behaviors coincide in the simple

very undesirable outcome: Condorcet winning alternative might be rejected,
Condorcet losing alternative might be elected, and Pareto dominated alternative

the second round, after the results of the first round have been published, the
remaining citizens decide whether to vote for one alternative or to ab- stain.
The votes from both rounds are aggregated, and the final outcome is obtained by
applying the majority rule, with ties being broken by fair randomization.
Within a costly voting framework, we show that large elec- torates will choose
the preferred alternative of the majority with high prob- ability, and that
average costs will be low. This result is in contrast with the literature on
one-round voting, which predicts either higher voting costs (when voting is

83,Exploring Weak Strategy-Proofness in Voting Theory,"Voting is the aggregation of individual preferences in order to select a
winning alternative. Selection of a winner is accomplished via a voting rule,

voting rule should be used? In social choice theory, desirable properties of
voting rules are expressed as axioms to be satisfied. This thesis focuses on
axioms concerning strategic manipulation by voters. Sometimes, voters may
intentionally misstate their true preferences in order to alter the outcome for
their own advantage. For example, in plurality rule, if a voter knows that
their top-choice candidate will lose, then they might instead vote for their
second-choice candidate just to avoid an even less desirable result. When no
coalition of voters can strategically manipulate, then the voting rule is said
to satisfy the axiom of Strategy-Proofness. A less restrictive axiom is Weak
Strategy-Proofness (as defined by Dasgupta and Maskin (2019)), which allows for
strategic manipulation by all but the smallest coalitions. Under certain
intuitive conditions, Dasgupta and Maskin (2019) proved that the only voting
rules satisfying Strategy-Proofness are rank-order voting and majority rule. In
my thesis, I generalize their result, by proving that rank-order voting and

according to a distribution $\pi$, and let $n$ go to infinity, then for any
$\epsilon >0$, with probability at least $1-\epsilon$, the minimum number of
operations that are needed for the strategic individual to achieve her goal
falls into one of the following four categories: (1) 0, (2) $\Theta(\sqrt n)$,
(3) $\Theta(n)$, and (4) $\infty$. This theorem holds for any set of vote
operations, any individual vote distribution $\pi$, and any integer generalized
scoring rule, which includes (but is not limited to) almost all commonly
studied voting rules, e.g., approval voting, all positional scoring rules
(including Borda, plurality, and veto), plurality with runoff, Bucklin,
Copeland, maximin, STV, and ranked pairs.
  We also show that many well-studied types of strategic behavior fall under
our framework, including (but not limited to) constructive/destructive
manipulation, bribery, and control by adding/deleting votes, margin of victory,
and minimum manipulation coalition size. Therefore, our main theorem naturally

manipulators' confidence in the non-manipulators' votes. To this end, we study
this problem in two settings - one where the manipulators need to compute a
manipulating vote that succeeds irrespective of perturbations in others' votes
({\em Distance Restricted Strong Manipulation}), and the second where the
manipulators need to compute a manipulating vote that succeeds for at least one
possible vote profile of the others ({\em Distance Restricted Weak
Manipulation}). We show that {\em Distance Restricted Strong Manipulation}
admits polynomial-time algorithms for every scoring rule, maximin, Bucklin, and
simplified Bucklin voting rules for a single manipulator, and for the
$k$-approval rule for any number of manipulators, but becomes intractable for
the Copeland$^\alpha$ voting rule for every $\alpha\in[0,1]$ even for a single
manipulator. In contrast, {\em Distance Restricted Weak Manipulation} is
intractable for almost all the common voting rules, with the exception of the
plurality rule. For a constant number of alternatives, we show that both the

been extensively studied over the decades. Recently, the related literature has
focused on quantifying the impact of utilizing only limited information in the
voting process on the societal welfare for the outcome, by bounding the
distortion of voting rules. Even though there has been significant progress
towards this goal, all previous works have so far neglected the fact that in
many scenarios (like presidential elections) voting is actually a distributed
procedure. In this paper, we consider a setting in which the voters are
partitioned into disjoint districts and vote locally therein to elect local
winning alternatives using a voting rule; the final outcome is then chosen from
the set of these alternatives. We prove tight bounds on the distortion of
well-known voting rules for such distributed elections both from a worst-case
perspective as well as from a best-case one. Our results indicate that the
partition of voters into districts leads to considerably higher distortion, a
phenomenon which we also experimentally showcase using real-world data.",1905.01882v2,cs.GT,2019-05-06 08:42:46+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Aris Filos-Ratsikas'), arxiv.Result.Author('Evi Micha'), arxiv.Result.Author('Alexandros A. Voudouris')]",

delegation favors minorities, that is, alternatives that have a lower chance of
winning ex-ante. The same occurs if the number of voting rights that actual
voters can have is capped. When the number of delegators increases, the
probability that the ex-ante minority wins under free and capped delegation
converges to the one under conventional voting--albeit non-monotonically. Our
results are obtained in a private value setting but can be readily translated
into an information aggregation setting when voters receive a signal about the
''correct"" alternative with some probability.",2102.08835v3,cs.GT,2021-02-17 15:44:38+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Hans Gersbach'), arxiv.Result.Author('Akaki Mamageishvili'), arxiv.Result.Author('Manvir Schneider')]",

alternative that best represents the preferences of the group. Agents may
manipulate the vote to achieve a better outcome by voting in a way that does
not reflect their true preferences. In real world voting scenarios, people
often do not have complete information about other voter preferences and it can
be computationally complex to identify a strategy that will maximize their
expected utility. In such situations, it is often assumed that voters will vote
truthfully rather than expending the effort to strategize. However, being
truthful is just one possible heuristic that may be used. In this paper, we
examine the effectiveness of heuristics in single winner and multi-winner
approval voting scenarios with missing votes. In particular, we look at
heuristics where a voter ignores information about other voting profiles and
makes their decisions based solely on how much they like each candidate. In a
behavioral experiment, we show that people vote truthfully in some situations
and prioritize high utility candidates in others. We examine when these
behaviors maximize expected utility and show how the structure of the voting
environment affects both how well each heuristic performs and how humans employ

majority voting systems with sufficiently large electorates as long as each
voter's independent probability of voting for that outcome is greater than 0.5.
Yet, in situations where direct voting systems are infeasible, such as due to
high implementation and infrastructure costs, hierarchical voting systems
provide a reasonable alternative. We study differences in outcome precision
between hierarchical and direct voting systems for varying group sizes,
abstention rates, and voter competencies. Using asymptotic expansions of the
derivative of the reliability function (or Banzhaf number), we first prove that
indirect systems differ most from their direct counterparts when group size and
number are equal to each other, and therefore to $\sqrt{N_{\rm d}}$, where
$N_{\rm d}$ is the total number of voters in the direct system. In multitier
systems, we prove that this difference is maximized when group size equals
$\sqrt[n]{N_{\rm d}}$, where $n$ is the number of hierarchical levels. Second,
we show that while direct majority rule always outperforms hierarchical voting
for homogeneous electorates that vote with certainty, as group numbers and size
increase, hierarchical majority voting gains in its ability to represent all
eligible voters. Furthermore, when voter abstention and competency are
correlated within groups, hierarchical systems often outperform direct voting,
which we show by using a generating function approach that is able to
analytically characterize heterogeneous voting systems.",2110.02298v1,math.CO,2021-10-05 19:01:52+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Lucas Böttcher'), arxiv.Result.Author('Georgia Kernell')]","Collect. Intell. 1, 1--16 (2022)"
93,Robust Sparse Voting,"Many modern Internet applications, like content moderation and recommendation
on social media, require reviewing and score a large number of alternatives. In
such a context, the voting can only be sparse, as the number of alternatives is
too large for any individual to review a significant fraction of all of them.
Moreover, in critical applications, malicious players might seek to hack the
voting process by entering dishonest reviews or creating fake accounts.
Classical voting methods are unfit for this task, as they usually (a) require
each reviewer to assess all available alternatives and (b) can be easily
manipulated by malicious players.
  This paper defines precisely the problem of robust sparse voting, highlights
its underlying technical challenges, and presents Mehestan, a novel voting
mechanism that solves the problem. Namely, we prove that by using Mehestan, no
(malicious) voter can have more than a small parametrizable effect on each
alternative's score, and we identify conditions of voters comparability under
which any unanimous preferences can be recovered, even when these preferences
are expressed by voters on very different scales.",2202.08656v1,cs.GT,2022-02-17 13:40:33+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Youssef Allouah'), arxiv.Result.Author('Rachid Guerraoui'), arxiv.Result.Author('Lê-Nguyên Hoang'), arxiv.Result.Author('Oscar Villemaud')]",

of Nature (say A and B, or Innocent and Guilty) with the majority opinion
determining the verdict. Jurors have private information in the form of a
signal in [-1,+1], with higher signals indicating A more likely. Each juror has
an ability in [0,1], which is proportional to the probability of A given a
positive signal, an analog of Condorcet's p for binary signals. We assume that
jurors vote honestly for the alternative they view more likely, given their
signal and prior voting, because they are experts who want to enhance their
reputation (after their vote and actual state of Nature is revealed). For a
fixed set of jury abilities, the reliability of the verdict depends on the
voting order. For a jury of size three, the optimal ordering is always as
follows: middle ability first, then highest ability, then lowest. For
sufficiently heterogeneous juries, sequential voting is more reliable than
simultaneous voting and is in fact optimal (allowing for non-honest voting).
When average ability is fixed, verdict reliability is increasing in
heterogeneity.
  For medium-sized juries, we find through simulation that the median ability
juror should still vote first and the remaining ones should have increasing and
then decreasing abilities.",2006.14045v2,econ.TH,2020-06-24 20:58:23+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Steve Alpern'), arxiv.Result.Author('Bo Chen')]",

intuitive idea that more reliable votes contain fewer alternatives, we define
several noise models that are approval voting variants of the Mallows model.
The likelihood-maximizing alternative is then characterized as the winner of a
weighted approval rule, where the weight of a ballot decreases with its
cardinality. We have conducted an experiment on three image annotation
datasets; they conclude that rules based on our noise model outperform standard

96,Optimized Distortion and Proportional Fairness in Voting,"A voting rule decides on a probability distribution over a set of $m$
alternatives, based on rankings of those alternatives provided by agents. We
assume that agents have cardinal utility functions over the alternatives, but
voting rules have access to only the rankings induced by these utilities. We
evaluate how well voting rules do on measures of social welfare and of
proportional fairness, computed based on the hidden utility functions.
  In particular, we study the distortion of voting rules, which is a worst-case
measure. It is an approximation ratio comparing the utilitarian social welfare
of the optimum outcome to the welfare of the outcome selected by the voting
rule, in the worst case over possible input profiles and utility functions that
are consistent with the input. The literature has studied distortion with
unit-sum utility functions, and left a small asymptotic gap in the best
possible distortion. Using tools from the theory of fair multi-winner
elections, we propose the first voting rule which achieves the optimal
distortion $\Theta(\sqrt{m})$ for unit-sum utilities. Our voting rule also
achieves optimum $\Theta(\sqrt{m})$ distortion for unit-range and approval
utilities.
  We then take a similar worst-case approach to a quantitative measure of the
fairness of a voting rule, called proportional fairness. Informally, it
measures whether the influence of cohesive groups of agents on the voting
outcome is proportional to the group size. We show that there is a voting rule
which, without knowledge of the utilities, can achieve an $O(\log
m)$-approximation to proportional fairness, the best possible approximation. As
a consequence of its proportional fairness, we show that this voting rule
achieves $O(\log m)$ distortion with respect to Nash welfare, and provides an
$O(\log m)$-approximation to the core, making it interesting for applications
in participatory budgeting.",2205.15760v2,cs.GT,2022-05-31 12:57:48+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Soroush Ebadian'), arxiv.Result.Author('Anson Kahng'), arxiv.Result.Author('Dominik Peters'), arxiv.Result.Author('Nisarg Shah')]",

tailored for approval votes and committees. These models take as input a ground
truth committee and return random approval votes to be thought of as noisy
estimates of the ground truth. A minimum robustness requirement for an
approval-based multiwinner voting rule is to return the ground truth when
applied to profiles with sufficiently many noisy votes. Our results indicate
that approval-based multiwinner voting is always robust to reasonable noise. We
further refine this finding by presenting a hierarchy of rules in terms of how

the class-conditional reconstruction part of CapsNets is also used to detect

of CapsNets, especially how the inner workings of CapsNets change when the
output capsules are attacked. The first observation is that adversarial
examples misled CapsNets by manipulating the votes from primary capsules.
Another observation is the high computational cost, when we directly apply
multi-step attack methods designed for CNNs to attack CapsNets, due to the
computationally expensive routing mechanism. Motivated by these two
observations, we propose a novel vote attack where we attack votes of CapsNets
directly. Our vote attack is not only effective but also efficient by
circumventing the routing process. Furthermore, we integrate our vote attack

102,Computing the proportional veto core,"In social choice there often arises a conflict between the majority principle
(the search for a candidate that is as good as possible for as many voters as
possible), and the protection of minority rights (choosing a candidate that is
not overly bad for particular individuals or groups). In a context where the
latter is our main concern, veto-based rules -- giving individuals or groups
the ability to strike off certain candidates from the list -- are a natural and
effective way of ensuring that no minority is left with an outcome they find
untenable. However, such rules often fail to be anonymous, or impose specific
restrictions on the number of voters and candidates. These issues can be
addressed by considering the proportional veto core -- the solution to a
cooperative game where every coalition is given the power to veto a number of
candidates proportional to its size. However, the naive algorithm for the veto

103,Quantification of De-anonymization Risks in Social Networks,"The risks of publishing privacy-sensitive data have received considerable
attention recently. Several de-anonymization attacks have been proposed to
re-identify individuals even if data anonymization techniques were applied.
However, there is no theoretical quantification for relating the data utility
that is preserved by the anonymization techniques and the data vulnerability
against de-anonymization attacks.
  In this paper, we theoretically analyze the de-anonymization attacks and
provide conditions on the utility of the anonymized data (denoted by anonymized
utility) to achieve successful de-anonymization. To the best of our knowledge,
this is the first work on quantifying the relationships between anonymized
utility and de-anonymization capability. Unlike previous work, our
quantification analysis requires no assumptions about the graph model, thus
providing a general theoretical guide for developing practical
de-anonymization/anonymization techniques.
  Furthermore, we evaluate state-of-the-art de-anonymization attacks on a
real-world Facebook dataset to show the limitations of previous work. By
comparing these experimental results and the theoretically achievable
de-anonymization capability derived in our analysis, we further demonstrate the
ineffectiveness of previous de-anonymization attacks and the potential of more
powerful de-anonymization attacks in the future.",1703.04873v1,cs.SI,2017-03-15 01:35:48+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Wei-Han Lee'), arxiv.Result.Author('Changchang Liu'), arxiv.Result.Author('Shouling Ji'), arxiv.Result.Author('Prateek Mittal'), arxiv.Result.Author('Ruby Lee')]",

communication into hard to trace paths hiding its origin or destination. In
anonymity the company is crucial, however the serial transportation imposes a
costly tradeoff between a level of privacy and a speed of communication.
  This paper introduces a framework of a novel architecture for anonymous
networks that hides initiators of communications by parallelization of
anonymous links. The new approach, which is based on the grounds of the
anonymous P2P network called P2Priv, does not require content forwarding via a
chain of proxy nodes to assure high degree of anonymity. Contrary to P2Priv,
the new architecture can be suited to anonymization of various network
communications, including anonymous access to distributed as well as
client-server services. In particular, it can be considered as an anonymization
platform for these network applications where both privacy and low delays are

This makes modelling of such networks a challenging task. Further, modelling
with crisp graphs is not suitable as they cannot capture the dynamic nature of
the anonymous networks. In this work, we model the anonymous networks using

deterministic outcomes. If n is no less than p the uniform lottery is the only
maximal (unimprovable) guarantee; there are many more if p>n, in particular the
ones inspired by the random dictator mechanism and by voting by veto. If n=2
the maximal set M(n,p) is a simple polytope where each vertex combines a round

building blocks of 2 to the power d simplices of dimension d in M(n,p), where d
is the quotient of p-1 by n. Their vertices are guarantees easy to interpret

logs. Anonymization allows organizations to share network logs while not
exposing sensitive information. However, there is an inherent trade off between
the amount of information revealed in the log and the usefulness of the log to
the client (the utility of a log). There are many anonymization techniques, and
there are many ways to anonymize a particular log (that is, which fields to
anonymize and how). Different anonymization policies will result in logs with
varying levels of utility for analysis. In this paper we explore the effect of
different anonymization policies on logs. We provide an empirical analysis of
the effect of varying anonymization policies by looking at the number of alerts
generated by an Intrusion Detection System. This is the first work to
thoroughly evaluate the effect of single field anonymization policies on a data
set. Our main contributions are to determine a set of fields that have a large

network based trust model to help anonymity networks circumvent malicious

independent fuzzy model to determine trust relationships between friends based
on qualitative and quantitative social attributes, both of which can be readily
obtained from existing social networks. Moreover, we design an algorithm for
propagating trust over an anonymity network. We integrate these two elements in
STor, a novel social network based Tor. We have implemented STor by modifying
the Tor's source code and conducted experiments on PlanetLab to evaluate the
effectiveness of STor. Both simulation and PlanetLab experiment results have
demonstrated that STor can achieve secure anonymity by establishing trust-based

113,On the Anonymity of Peer-To-Peer Network Anonymity Schemes Used by Cryptocurrencies,"Cryptocurrency systems can be subject to deanonimization attacks by
exploiting the network-level communication on their peer-to-peer network.
Adversaries who control a set of colluding node(s) within the peer-to-peer
network can observe transactions being exchanged and infer the parties
involved. Thus, various network anonymity schemes have been proposed to
mitigate this problem, with some solutions providing theoretical anonymity
guarantees.
  In this work, we model such peer-to-peer network anonymity solutions and
evaluate their anonymity guarantees. To do so, we propose a novel framework
that uses Bayesian inference to obtain the probability distributions linking
transactions to their possible originators. We characterize transaction
anonymity with those distributions, using entropy as metric of adversarial
uncertainty on the originator's identity. In particular, we model Dandelion,
Dandelion++ and Lightning Network. We study different configurations and
demonstrate that none of them offers acceptable anonymity to their users. For
instance, our analysis reveals that in the widely deployed Lightning Network,
with 1% strategically chosen colluding nodes the adversary can uniquely
determine the originator for about 50% of the total transactions in the
network. In Dandelion, an adversary that controls 15% of the nodes has on
average uncertainty among only 8 possible originators. Moreover, we observe
that due to the way Dandelion and Dandelion++ are designed, increasing the
network size does not correspond to an increase in the anonymity set of
potential originators. Alarmingly, our longitudinal analysis of Lightning
Network reveals rather an inverse trend -- with the growth of the network the
overall anonymity decreases.",2201.11860v4,cs.CR,2022-01-27 23:59:51+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Piyush Kumar Sharma'), arxiv.Result.Author('Devashish Gosain'), arxiv.Result.Author('Claudia Diaz')]",

anonymization techniques fail against existing graph de-anonymization attacks.
However, the specific reason for the success of such de-anonymization attacks
is yet to be understood. This paper systematically studies the structural
properties of real graphs that make them more vulnerable to machine
learning-based techniques for de-anonymization. More precisely, we study the
boundaries of anonymity based on the structural properties of real graph
datasets in terms of how their dK-based anonymized versions resist (or fail) to
various types of attacks. Our experimental results lead to three contributions.
First, we identify the strength of an attacker based on the graph
characteristics of the subset of nodes from which it starts the

concept of PHY anonymity, and reveal that the receiver can unmask the sender's
identity by only analyzing the PHY information, i.e., the signaling patterns
and the characteristics of channel. We investigate two practical scenarios,
where the receiver has more antennas than the sender in the strong receiver
case, and vice versa in the strong sender case. For each scenario, we first
investigate sender detection strategy at the receiver, and then we develop
corresponding anonymous precoding to address anonymity while guaranteeing high
receive signal-to-interference-plus-noise-ratio (SINR) for communications. In
particular, an interference suppression anonymous precoder is first proposed,
assisted by a dedicated transmit phase equalizer for removing phase ambiguity.
Afterwards, a constructive interference anonymous precoder is further
investigated to utilize the inter-antenna interference as a beneficial element
without loss of sender's anonymity. Simulation demonstrates the proposed
anonymous precoders are able to preserve the sender's anonymity and
simultaneously guarantee high receive SINR, opening a new dimension on PHY

achievable network performance for any given level of anonymity. The network
performance is measured by the achievable relay rates from the sources to
destinations under latency and medium access constraints. In particular,
analytical results are presented for two scenarios:
  For a two-hop network with maximum anonymity, achievable rate regions for a
general m x 1 relay are characterized when nodes generate independent Poisson
transmission schedules. The rate regions are presented for both strict and
average delay constraints on traffic flow through the relay.
  For a multihop network with an arbitrary anonymity requirement, the problem
of maximizing the sum-rate of flows (network throughput) is considered. A
selective independent scheduling strategy is designed for this purpose, and
using the analytical results for the two-hop network, the achievable throughput
is characterized as a function of the anonymity level. The throughput-anonymity

anywhere on the line, its favorite candidate is within a distance $\theta$ of
the favorite candidate of its closest proxy. This property guarantees a strong
form of representation as the set of voters is not required to be fixed in
advance, or even be finite. We show that for candidates located on a line, an
optimal proxy arrangement can be computed in polynomial time. Moreover, we
provide upper and lower bounds on the number of proxies required to form a
$\theta$-representative set, thus showing that a relatively small number of
proxies is enough to capture the preferences of any set of voters. An
additional beneficial property of a $\theta$-representative proxy arrangement

121,Power-Efficient Direct-Voting Assurance for Data Fusion in Wireless Sensor Networks,"Wireless sensor networks place sensors into an area to collect data and send
them back to a base station. Data fusion, which fuses the collected data before
they are sent to the base station, is usually implemented over the network.
Since the sensor is typically placed in locations accessible to malicious
attackers, information assurance of the data fusion process is very important.
A witness-based approach has been proposed to validate the fusion data. In this
approach, the base station receives the fusion data and ""votes"" on the data
from a randomly chosen sensor node. The vote comes from other sensor nodes,
called ""witnesses,"" to verify the correctness of the fusion data. Because the
base station obtains the vote through the chosen node, the chosen node could
forge the vote if it is compromised. Thus, the witness node must encrypt the
vote to prevent this forgery. Compared with the vote, the encryption requires
more bits, increasing transmission burden from the chosen node to the base
station. The chosen node consumes more power. This work improves the
witness-based approach using direct voting mechanism such that the proposed
scheme has better performance in terms of assurance, overhead, and delay. The
witness node transmits the vote directly to the base station. Forgery is not a
problem in this scheme. Moreover, fewer bits are necessary to represent the
vote, significantly reducing the power consumption. Performance analysis and
simulation results indicate that the proposed approach can achieve a 40 times
better overhead than the witness-based approach.",0705.3683v1,cs.CR,2007-05-25 02:56:47+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('H. -T. Pai'), arxiv.Result.Author('Y. S. Han')]",

The discretization of centroid voting reduces the training of instance
segmentation to pixel labeling, analogous and complementary to FCN-style

distributed node scheduling algorithm, called Local Voting, is proposed. This
algorithm tries to semi-equalize the load (defined as the ratio of the queue
length over the number of allocated slots) through slot reallocation based on
local information exchange. The algorithm stems from the finding that the
shortest delivery time or delay is obtained when the load is semi-equalized
throughout the network. In addition, we prove that, with Local Voting, the
network system converges asymptotically towards the optimal scheduling.
Moreover, through extensive simulations, the performance of Local Voting is
further investigated in comparison with several representative scheduling
algorithms from the literature. Simulation results show that the proposed
algorithm achieves better performance than the other distributed algorithms in
terms of average delay, maximum delay, and fairness. Despite being distributed,
the performance of Local Voting is also found to be very close to a centralized
algorithm that is deemed to have the optimal performance.",1701.09010v2,cs.NI,2017-01-31 12:27:09+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Dimitrios J.

130,Sparse Signal Recovery for Binary Compressed Sensing by Majority Voting Neural Networks,"In this paper, we propose majority voting neural networks for sparse signal
recovery in binary compressed sensing. The majority voting neural network is
composed of several independently trained feedforward neural networks employing
the sigmoid function as an activation function. Our empirical study shows that
a choice of a loss function used in training processes for the network is of
prime importance. We found a loss function suitable for sparse signal recovery,
which includes a cross entropy-like term and an $L_1$ regularized term. From
the experimental results, we observed that the majority voting neural network
achieves excellent recovery performance, which is approaching the optimal
performance as the number of component nets grows. The simple architecture of
the majority voting neural networks would be beneficial for both software and
hardware implementations.",1610.09463v1,cs.IT,2016-10-29 06:12:03+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Daisuke Ito'), arxiv.Result.Author('Tadashi Wadayama')]",
131,"The Efficiency Gap, Voter Turnout, and the Efficiency Principle","Recently, scholars from law and political science have introduced metrics
which use only election outcomes (and not district geometry) to assess the
presence of partisan gerrymandering. The most high-profile example of such a
tool is the efficiency gap. Some scholars have suggested that such tools should
be sensitive enough to alert us when two election outcomes have the same
percentage of votes going to political party $A$, but one of the two awards
party $A$ more seats. When a metric is able to distinguish election outcomes in
this way, that metric is said to satisfy the efficiency principle.
  In this article, we show that the efficiency gap fails to satisfy the
efficiency principle. We show precisely how the efficiency principle breaks
down in the presence of unequal voter turnout. To do this, we first present a
construction that, given any rationals $1/4< V<3/4$ and $0<S<1$, constructs an
election outcome with vote share $V$, seat share $S$, and EG = 0. (For
instance, one party can get 26% of the vote and anywhere from 1% to 99% of the
seats while the efficiency gap remains zero.) Then, for any election with vote
share $1/4<V<3/4$, seat share $S$, and EG= 0, we express the ratio $\rho$ of
average turnout in districts party $A$ lost to average turnout in districts
party $A$ won as a function in only $V$ and $S$. It is well known that when all
districts have equal turnout, EG can be expressed as a simple formula in $V$
and $S$; we express the efficiency gap of any election as an equation only in
$V, S,$ and $\rho$. We also report on the values of $\rho$ that can be observed
in actual elections.",1801.05301v2,physics.soc-ph,2018-01-13 16:38:53+00:00,[arxiv.Result.Author('Ellen Veomett')],
132,Massively Parallel and Asynchronous Tsetlin Machine Architecture Supporting Almost Constant-Time Scaling,"Using logical clauses to represent patterns, Tsetlin Machines (TMs) have
recently obtained competitive performance in terms of accuracy, memory
footprint, energy, and learning speed on several benchmarks. Each TM clause
votes for or against a particular class, with classification resolved using a
majority vote. While the evaluation of clauses is fast, being based on binary
operators, the voting makes it necessary to synchronize the clause evaluation,
impeding parallelization. In this paper, we propose a novel scheme for
desynchronizing the evaluation of clauses, eliminating the voting bottleneck.
In brief, every clause runs in its own thread for massive native parallelism.
For each training example, we keep track of the class votes obtained from the
clauses in local voting tallies. The local voting tallies allow us to detach
the processing of each clause from the rest of the clauses, supporting
decentralized learning. This means that the TM most of the time will operate on
outdated voting tallies. We evaluated the proposed parallelization across
diverse learning tasks and it turns out that our decentralized TM learning
algorithm copes well with working on outdated data, resulting in no significant
loss in learning accuracy. Furthermore, we show that the proposed approach
provides up to 50 times faster learning. Finally, learning time is almost
constant for reasonable clause amounts (employing from 20 to 7,000 clauses on a
Tesla V100 GPU). For sufficiently large clause numbers, computation time
increases approximately proportionally. Our parallel and asynchronous
architecture thus allows processing of massive datasets and operating with more
clauses for higher accuracy.",2009.04861v4,cs.AI,2020-09-10 13:48:33+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('K.

133,On the Manipulability of Voting Systems: Application to Multi-Carrier Networks,"Today, Internet involves many actors who are making revenues on it
(operators, companies, service providers,...). It is therefore important to be
able to make fair decisions in this large-scale and highly competitive
economical ecosystem. One of the main issues is to prevent actors from
manipulating the natural outcome of the decision process. For that purpose,
game theory is a natural framework. In that context, voting systems represent
an interesting alternative that, to our knowledge, has not yet been considered.
They allow competing entities to decide among different options. Strong
theoretical results showed that all voting systems are susceptible to be
manipulated by one single voter, except for some ""degenerated"" and
non-acceptable cases. However, very little is known about how much a voting
system is manipulable in practical scenarios. In this paper, we investigate
empirically the use of voting systems for choosing end-to-end paths in
multi-carrier networks, analyzing their manipulability and their economical
efficiency. We show that one particular system, called \Single Transferable
Vote (STV), is largely more resistant to manipulability than the natural system
which tries to get the economical optimum. Moreover, STV manages to select
paths close to the economical optimum, whether the participants try to cheat or
not.",1204.6455v1,cs.NI,2012-04-29 05:30:06+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('François Durand'), arxiv.Result.Author('Fabien Mathieu'), arxiv.Result.Author('Ludovic Noirie')]",N&deg; 2012-04-001 (2012)

larger region $Y$, in which the sensors are distributed by a Poisson process of
density $\lambda$ to detect this event region, i.e., its boundary. The model of
sensor is a 0-1 sensor that decides whether it lies in $X$ or not, and which
might be incorrect with probability $p$. It also collects information on the
0-1 values of the neighbors within some distance $r$ and revises its decision
by the majority vote of these neighbors. In the most general setting, we
analyze this simple majority vote scheme and derive some upper and lower bounds
on the expected number of misclassified sensors. These bounds depend on several
sensing parameters of $p$, $r$, and some geometric parameters of the event
region $X$. By making some assumptions on the shape of $X$, we prove a
significantly improved upper bound on the expected number of misclassified
sensors; especially for convex regions with sufficiently round boundary, and we
find that the majority vote scheme performs well in the simulation rather than
its theoretical upper bound.",1311.3149v1,cs.CG,2013-08-20 07:01:26+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Peter Brass'), arxiv.Result.Author('Hyeon-Suk Na'), arxiv.Result.Author('Chan-Su Shin')]",

FLS imagery across local temporal scales. LFN enables target label consensus
voting across images and generally improves target detection and recognition
rates.
  We evaluate our framework using real-world FLS imagery with multiple broad
target classes that have high intra-class variability and rich sub-class
structure. We show that few-shot learning, with anywhere from ten to thirty

148,The Large Hadron-Electron Collider at the HL-LHC,"The Large Hadron electron Collider (LHeC) is designed to move the field of
deep inelastic scattering (DIS) to the energy and intensity frontier of
particle physics. Exploiting energy recovery technology, it collides a novel,
intense electron beam with a proton or ion beam from the High Luminosity--Large
Hadron Collider (HL-LHC). The accelerator and interaction region are designed
for concurrent electron-proton and proton-proton operation. This report
represents an update of the Conceptual Design Report (CDR) of the LHeC,
published in 2012. It comprises new results on parton structure of the proton
and heavier nuclei, QCD dynamics, electroweak and top-quark physics. It is
shown how the LHeC will open a new chapter of nuclear particle physics in
extending the accessible kinematic range in lepton-nucleus scattering by
several orders of magnitude. Due to enhanced luminosity, large energy and the
cleanliness of the hadronic final states, the LHeC has a strong Higgs physics
programme and its own discovery potential for new physics. Building on the 2012
CDR, the report represents a detailed updated design of the energy recovery
electron linac (ERL) including new lattice, magnet, superconducting radio
frequency technology and further components. Challenges of energy recovery are
described and the lower energy, high current, 3-turn ERL facility, PERLE at
Orsay, is presented which uses the LHeC characteristics serving as a
development facility for the design and operation of the LHeC. An updated
detector design is presented corresponding to the acceptance, resolution and
calibration goals which arise from the Higgs and parton density function
physics programmes. The paper also presents novel results on the Future
Circular Collider in electron-hadron mode, FCC-eh, which utilises the same ERL
technology to further extend the reach of DIS to even higher centre-of-mass
energies.",2007.14491v2,hep-ex,2020-07-28 21:17:51+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('P. Agostini'), arxiv.Result.Author('H. Aksakal'), arxiv.Result.Author('S. Alekhin'), arxiv.Result.Author('P. P.

production provide essential constraints in the determination of parton
distribution functions. Experimentally, they have reached percent level
precision, challenging the accuracy of the theoretical predictions. In this
work we benchmark the novel implementation in $\texttt{DYTurbo}$ of linear
fiducial power corrections in the $q_T$-subtraction formalism at NLO and NNLO
in QCD. We illustrate how the inclusion of linear fiducial power corrections
impacts predictions for precise $W$ and $Z$ measurements from the LHC and
affects their description by modern global parton distribution functions. The
further inclusion of $q_T$-resummation corrections in the theoretical
predictions leads to a better modelling of the lepton $p_T$ distribution and we
study how this improve the description of the data.",2209.13535v1,hep-ph,2022-09-27 16:48:54+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Simone Amoroso'), arxiv.Result.Author('Ludovica Aperio Bella'), arxiv.Result.Author('Maarten Boonekamp'), arxiv.Result.Author('Stefano Camarda'), arxiv.Result.Author('Alexander Glazov'), arxiv.Result.Author('Alessandro Guida'), arxiv.Result.Author('Renat Sadykov'), arxiv.Result.Author('Yulia Yermolchyk')]",
152,Automated Image Analysis of Hodgkin lymphoma,"Hodgkin lymphoma is an unusual type of lymphoma, arising from malignant
B-cells. Morphological and immunohistochemical features of malignant cells and
their distribution differ from other cancer types. Based on systematic tissue
image analysis, computer-aided exploration can provide new insights into
Hodgkin lymphoma pathology. In this paper, we report results from an image
analysis of CD30 immunostained Hodgkin lymphoma tissue section images. To the
best of our knowledge, this is the first systematic application of image
analysis to a set of tissue sections of Hodgkin lymphoma. We have implemented
an automatic procedure to handle and explore image data in Aperio's SVS format.
We use pre-processing approaches on a down-scaled image to separate the image
objects from the background. Then, we apply a supervised classification method
to assign pixels to predefined classes. Our pre-processing method is able to
separate the tissue content of images from the image background. We analyzed
three immunohistologically defined groups, non-lymphoma and the two most common
forms of Hodgkin lymphoma, nodular sclerosis and mixed cellularity type. We
found that nodular sclerosis and non-lymphoma images exhibit different amounts
of CD30 stain, whereas mixed cellularity type exhibits a large variance and
overlaps with the other groups. The results can be seen as a first step to
computationally identify tumor regions in the images. This allows us to focus
on these regions when performing computationally expensive tasks like object
detection in the high-resolution image.",1209.3189v1,q-bio.TO,2012-09-14 13:42:49+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Alexander Schmitz'), arxiv.Result.Author('Tim Schäfer'), arxiv.Result.Author('Hendrik Schäfer'), arxiv.Result.Author('Claudia Döring'), arxiv.Result.Author('Jörg Ackermann'), arxiv.Result.Author('Norbert Dichter'), arxiv.Result.Author('Sylvia Hartmann'), arxiv.Result.Author('Martin-Leo Hansmann'), arxiv.Result.Author('Ina Koch')]",
153,Iterative annotation to ease neural network training: Specialized machine learning in medical image analysis,"Neural networks promise to bring robust, quantitative analysis to medical
fields, but adoption is limited by the technicalities of training these
networks. To address this translation gap between medical researchers and
neural networks in the field of pathology, we have created an intuitive
interface which utilizes the commonly used whole slide image (WSI) viewer,
Aperio ImageScope (Leica Biosystems Imaging, Inc.), for the annotation and
display of neural network predictions on WSIs. Leveraging this, we propose the
use of a human-in-the-loop strategy to reduce the burden of WSI annotation. We
track network performance improvements as a function of iteration and quantify
the use of this pipeline for the segmentation of renal histologic findings on
WSIs. More specifically, we present network performance when applied to
segmentation of renal micro compartments, and demonstrate multi-class
segmentation in human and mouse renal tissue slides. Finally, to show the
adaptability of this technique to other medical imaging fields, we demonstrate
its ability to iteratively segment human prostate glands from radiology imaging

154,Full-privacy secured search engine empowered by efficient genome-mapping algorithms,"Since the 90s, keyword-based search engines have been helping people locate
relevant web content via a simple query, so have the recent full-text-based
search engines mainly used for plagiarism detection following an article
upload. However, these ""free"" or paid services operate by storing users' search
queries and preferences for personal profiling and targeted ads delivery, while
user-uploaded articles can further profit the service providers as part of
their expanding databases. In short, search engine privacy has not been an
option for web exploration in the past decades. Here we demonstrate that a
database or internet search, provided with the entire article as a query, can
be correctly carried out without revealing users' sensitive queries by an
irreversible encoding scheme and an efficient FM-index search routine that is
generally used in the NGS of genomes. In our solution, Sapiens Aperio Veritas
Engine (S.A.V.E.), every word in the query is encoded into one of 12 ""amino
acids"" (a.a.) comprising a pseudo-biological sequence (PBS) at users' local
machines. The PBS-mediated plagiarism detection is done by users' submission of
locally encoded PBS through our cloud service to locate identical duplicates in
the collected web contents which had been encoded in the same way as the query.
It is found that PBSs with a length longer than 12 a.a., can return correct
results with a false positive rate <0.8%. S.A.V.E. runs at a similar speed as
Bowtie and is 4 orders faster than BLAST. S.A.V.E., functioning in both regular
and in-private search modes, provides a new option for efficient internet
search and plagiarism detection in a compressed search space without a chance
of storing and revealing users' confidential contents. We expect that future
privacy-aware search engines can reference the ideas proposed herein. S.A.V.E.

155,An Experiment for Electron-Hadron Scattering at the LHC,"Novel considerations are presented on the physics, apparatus and accelerator
designs for a future, luminous, energy frontier electron-hadron ($eh$)
scattering experiment at the LHC in the thirties for which key physics topics
and their relation to the hadron-hadron HL-LHC physics programme are discussed.
Demands are derived set by these physics topics on the design of the LHeC
detector, a corresponding update of which is described. Optimisations on the
accelerator design, especially the interaction region (IR), are presented.
Initial accelerator considerations indicate that a common IR is possible to be
built which alternately could serve $eh$ and $hh$ collisions while other
experiments would stay on $hh$ in either condition. A forward-backward
symmetrised option of the LHeC detector is sketched which would permit
extending the LHeC physics programme to also include aspects of hadron-hadron
physics. The vision of a joint $eh$ and $hh$ physics experiment is shown to
open new prospects for solving fundamental problems of high energy heavy-ion
physics including the partonic structure of nuclei and the emergence of
hydrodynamics in quantum field theory while the genuine TeV scale DIS physics
is of unprecedented rank.",2201.02436v1,hep-ex,2022-01-07 12:48:50+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('K. D. J. André'), arxiv.Result.Author('L. Aperio Bella'), arxiv.Result.Author('N.

156,Standard Model Physics at the HL-LHC and HE-LHC,"The successful operation of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) and the excellent
performance of the ATLAS, CMS, LHCb and ALICE detectors in Run-1 and Run-2 with
$pp$ collisions at center-of-mass energies of 7, 8 and 13 TeV as well as the
giant leap in precision calculations and modeling of fundamental interactions
at hadron colliders have allowed an extraordinary breadth of physics studies
including precision measurements of a variety physics processes. The LHC
results have so far confirmed the validity of the Standard Model of particle
physics up to unprecedented energy scales and with great precision in the
sectors of strong and electroweak interactions as well as flavour physics, for
instance in top quark physics. The upgrade of the LHC to a High Luminosity
phase (HL-LHC) at 14 TeV center-of-mass energy with 3 ab$^{-1}$ of integrated
luminosity will probe the Standard Model with even greater precision and will
extend the sensitivity to possible anomalies in the Standard Model, thanks to a
ten-fold larger data set, upgraded detectors and expected improvements in the
theoretical understanding. This document summarises the physics reach of the
HL-LHC in the realm of strong and electroweak interactions and top quark
physics, and provides a glimpse of the potential of a possible further upgrade
of the LHC to a 27 TeV $pp$ collider, the High-Energy LHC (HE-LHC), assumed to
accumulate an integrated luminosity of 15 ab$^{-1}$.",1902.04070v3,hep-ph,2019-02-11 09:45:44+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('P. Azzi'), arxiv.Result.Author('S. Farry'), arxiv.Result.Author('P.

157,The Large Hadron-Electron Collider at the HL-LHC,"The Large Hadron electron Collider (LHeC) is designed to move the field of
deep inelastic scattering (DIS) to the energy and intensity frontier of
particle physics. Exploiting energy recovery technology, it collides a novel,
intense electron beam with a proton or ion beam from the High Luminosity--Large
Hadron Collider (HL-LHC). The accelerator and interaction region are designed
for concurrent electron-proton and proton-proton operation. This report
represents an update of the Conceptual Design Report (CDR) of the LHeC,
published in 2012. It comprises new results on parton structure of the proton
and heavier nuclei, QCD dynamics, electroweak and top-quark physics. It is
shown how the LHeC will open a new chapter of nuclear particle physics in
extending the accessible kinematic range in lepton-nucleus scattering by
several orders of magnitude. Due to enhanced luminosity, large energy and the
cleanliness of the hadronic final states, the LHeC has a strong Higgs physics
programme and its own discovery potential for new physics. Building on the 2012
CDR, the report represents a detailed updated design of the energy recovery
electron linac (ERL) including new lattice, magnet, superconducting radio
frequency technology and further components. Challenges of energy recovery are
described and the lower energy, high current, 3-turn ERL facility, PERLE at
Orsay, is presented which uses the LHeC characteristics serving as a
development facility for the design and operation of the LHeC. An updated
detector design is presented corresponding to the acceptance, resolution and
calibration goals which arise from the Higgs and parton density function
physics programmes. The paper also presents novel results on the Future
Circular Collider in electron-hadron mode, FCC-eh, which utilises the same ERL
technology to further extend the reach of DIS to even higher centre-of-mass
energies.",2007.14491v2,hep-ex,2020-07-28 21:17:51+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('P. Agostini'), arxiv.Result.Author('H. Aksakal'), arxiv.Result.Author('S. Alekhin'), arxiv.Result.Author('P. P.

However, inspecting all SEEs is not possible due to the large number of SEEs

based on a machine learning approach. The method was trained with the random
forest algorithm with historical data provided by each SEE. Three consecutive
periods of data were concatenated. The proposed method uses these periods as
input data and predicts the risk of each SEE in the fourth period. The model
achieved 76\% overall accuracy. In addition, it obtained good accuracy in
predicting the high risk of a SEE. We found that the legal nature and the
variation of the past-due portfolio are good predictors of the future risk of a
SEE. Thus, the risk of a SEE in a future period can be predicted by a
supervised machine learning method. Predicting the high risk of a SEE improves
the daily work of each inspector by focusing only on high-risk SEEs.",2210.05052v1,cs.LG,2022-10-10 23:50:02+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Joseph Gallego-Mejia'), arxiv.Result.Author('Daniela Martin-Vega'), arxiv.Result.Author('Fabio Gonzalez')]",

161,"The see-saw mechanism: neutrino mixing, leptogenesis and lepton flavor violation","The see-saw mechanism to generate small neutrino masses is reviewed. After
summarizing our current knowledge about the low energy neutrino mass matrix we
consider reconstructing the see-saw mechanism. Low energy neutrino physics is
not sufficient to reconstruct see-saw, a feature which we refer to as ``see-saw
degeneracy''. Indirect tests of see-saw are leptogenesis and lepton flavor
violation in supersymmetric scenarios, which together with neutrino mass and
mixing define the framework of see-saw phenomenology. Several examples are
given, both phenomenological and GUT-related. Variants of the see-saw mechanism
like the type II or triplet see-saw are also discussed. In particular, we
compare many general aspects regarding the dependence of LFV on low energy
neutrino parameters in the extreme cases of a dominating conventional see-saw
term or a dominating triplet term. For instance, the absence of mu -> e gamma
or tau -> e gamma in the pure triplet case means that CP is conserved in
neutrino oscillations. Scanning models, we also find that among the decays mu
-> e gamma, tau -> e gamma and tau -> mu gamma the latter one has the largest
branching ratio in (i) SO(10) type I see-saw models and in (ii) scenarios in
which the triplet term dominates in the neutrino mass matrix.",0804.3925v3,hep-ph,2008-04-24 13:44:29+00:00,[arxiv.Result.Author('Werner Rodejohann')],"Pramana 72:217-227,2009"

The first 500 m contribute 60% to the total seeing, the free-atmosphere median

0.15 arcseconds because there is always some turbulence above 12 km. A 4-day
period of calm upper atmosphere with a stable free-atmosphere seeing of 0.2-0.3
arcseconds was noted. A gain in resolution from adaptive compensation of ground
layer will be 1.7 times typically and 2-3 times during such calm periods.
Correlations of the free-atmosphere turbulence with the wind speed at
tropopause and of the ground-layer turbulence with ground wind are studied.
Temporal evolution of turbulence is characterized by recurrent bursts, their
typical duration increases from 15 minutes in low layers to 1-2 hours in high

166,A Machine Learning Approach to Correcting Atmospheric Seeing in Solar Flare Observations,"Current post-processing techniques for the correction of atmospheric seeing
in solar observations -- such as Speckle interferometry and Phase Diversity
methods -- have limitations when it comes to their reconstructive capabilities
of solar flare observations. This, combined with the sporadic nature of flares
meaning observers cannot wait until seeing conditions are optimal before taking
measurements, means that many ground-based solar flare observations are marred
with bad seeing. To combat this, we propose a method for dedicated flare seeing
correction based on training a deep neural network to learn to correct
artificial seeing from flare observations taken during good seeing conditions.
This model uses transfer learning, a novel technique in solar physics, to help
learn these corrections. Transfer learning is when another network already
trained on similar data is used to influence the learning of the new network.
Once trained, the model has been applied to two flare datasets: one from
AR12157 on 2014/09/06 and one from AR12673 on 2017/09/06. The results show good
corrections to images with bad seeing with a relative error assigned to the
estimate based on the performance of the model. Further discussion takes place

they each suffer from various problems. Six of these methods are discussed in
this paper. They are Satisfaction Approval Voting, Minimax Approval Voting,
Proportional Approval Voting, Monroe's Fully Proportional Representation,
Chamberlin-Courant's Rule, and Ebert's method. They all fail at least one of
Proportional Representation (PR), strong PR, monotonicity or positive support.
However, the new method described in this paper - Proportional Approval Method
using Squared loads, Approval removal and Coin-flip approval transformation
(PAMSAC) - passes them all. PAMSAC uses the squared loads of Ebert's method,
but removes non-beneficial approvals to restore monotonicity. It also uses the
Coin-Flip Approval Transformation (CFAT), where voters are ""split"" into two for
each candidate they approve, and where one half of this split voter approves
and the other half does not approve each candidate approved on the ballot. This
restores positive support, and also makes the method equivalent to the D'Hondt
party-list method for party voting. PAMSAC reduces to simple approval voting in
the single-winner case. A score voting version is described that also reduces

then study parameterized complexity of this problem with five natural
parameters, namely the target score, the size of the committee (and its dual
parameter, the number of candidates outside the committee), the number of
outliers (and its dual parameter, the number of non-outliers). For net approval

the parameterized complexity of this problem for all subsets of five natural
parameters considered (by showing either FPT or W[1]-hardness for all subsets
of parameters). For the approval voting rule, we resolve the parameterized
complexity of this problem for all subsets of parameters except one.

tailored for approval votes and committees. These models take as input a ground
truth committee and return random approval votes to be thought of as noisy
estimates of the ground truth. A minimum robustness requirement for an
approval-based multiwinner voting rule is to return the ground truth when
applied to profiles with sufficiently many noisy votes. Our results indicate
that approval-based multiwinner voting is always robust to reasonable noise. We
further refine this finding by presenting a hierarchy of rules in terms of how

be made to mimic plurality or approval voting in the event of a single winner
while potentially breaking ties otherwise. Under the assumption that voters are
honest, we show that it is possible to find the values of k for which a given

situations, agents may use heuristics to strategize, instead of incurring the
additional effort required to compute the manipulation which most favors them.
In this paper, we examine voting behavior in multi-winner approval voting

from winning (""destructive control""), which yields a total of 22 standard
control scenarios. To protect elections from such control attempts,
computational complexity has been used to show that electoral control, though
not impossible, is computationally prohibitive. Among natural voting systems
with a polynomial-time winner problem, the two systems with the highest number
of proven resistances to control types (namely 19 out of 22) are
""sincere-strategy preference-based approval voting"" (SP-AV, a modification of a
system proposed by Brams and Sanver) and fallback voting. Both are hybrid
systems; e.g., fallback voting combines approval with Bucklin voting. In this
paper, we study the control complexity of Bucklin voting itself and show that
it behaves equally well in terms of control resistance for the 20 cases
investigated so far. As Bucklin voting is a special case of fallback voting,
all resistances shown for Bucklin voting in this paper strengthen the
corresponding resistance for fallback voting.",1005.4115v1,cs.CC,2010-05-22 09:12:04+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Gábor Erdélyi'), arxiv.Result.Author('Lena Piras'), arxiv.Result.Author('Jörg Rothe')]",
186,Multi-Winner Voting with Approval Preferences,"Multi-winner voting is the process of selecting a fixed-size set of
representative candidates based on voters' preferences. It occurs in
applications ranging from politics (parliamentary elections) to the design of
modern computer applications (collaborative filtering, dynamic Q&A platforms,
diversifying search results). All these applications share the problem of
identifying a representative subset of alternatives -- and the study of
multi-winner voting is the principled analysis of this task.
  This book provides a thorough and in-depth look at multi-winner voting based
on approval preferences. One speaks of approval preferences if voters express
their preferences by providing a set of candidates they approve. Approval
preferences thus separate candidates in approved and disapproved ones, a
simple, binary classification. The corresponding multi-winner voting rules are
called approval-based committee (ABC) rules. Due to the simplicity of approval
preferences, ABC rules are widely suitable for practical use.
  Recent years have seen a rising interest in ABC voting. While multi-winner
voting has been originally a topic studied by economists and political
scientists, a significant share of recent progress has occurred in the field of
computational social choice. This discipline is situated in the intersection of
artificial intelligence, computer science, economics, and (to a lesser degree)
political science, combining insights and methods from these distinct fields.
The goal of this book is to present fundamental concepts and results for ABC
voting and to discuss the recent advances in computational social choice. The
main focus is on axiomatic analysis, algorithmic results, and relevant
applications.",2007.01795v5,cs.GT,2020-07-03 16:33:50+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Martin Lackner'), arxiv.Result.Author('Piotr Skowron')]","SpringerBriefs in Intelligent Systems, Springer International

187,Choosing by means of approval-preferential voting. The path-revised approval choice,"Approval-preferential voting is problematical since it combines two different
kinds of information that could by themselves lead to different choices. This
article analyses the problem and studies a new proposal to deal with it. The
existing methods are overviewed with special attention to several desirable
properties that are not always met. Particular emphasis is made on certain
rather unknown views of Condorcet about this subject. The proposed procedure
definitely aims for a choice in the spirit of approval voting. However, it
still makes use of the preferential information so as to improve the approval
one. This is done by means of the path scores, in common to Schulze's method
for preferential voting. The resulting method, that we call path-revised
approval choice, is shown to enjoy several good properties. In particular, it
fulfils in a well-defined sense Condorcet's latest view that a surely good
option should prevail over a doubtfully best one.",1411.1367v4,cs.GT,2014-11-03 23:55:05+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Rosa Camps'), arxiv.Result.Author('Xavier Mora'), arxiv.Result.Author('Laia Saumell')]",

result in logical inconsistencies, which has led to a number of important
impossibility theorems. We first prove a general result that shows that for a
wide range of such principles, characterised by their syntactic form when
expressed in a many-sorted first-order logic, any impossibility exhibited at a
fixed (small) domain size will necessarily extend to the general case. We then
show how to formulate candidates for impossibility theorems at a fixed domain
size in propositional logic, which in turn enables us to automatically search

197,Easy Impossibility Proofs for k-Set Agreement in Message Passing Systems,"Despite of being quite similar agreement problems, consensus and general
k-set agreement require surprisingly different techniques for proving the
impossibility in asynchronous systems with crash failures: Rather than
relatively simple bivalence arguments as in the impossibility proof for
consensus (= 1-set agreement) in the presence of a single crash failure, known
proofs for the impossibility of k-set agreement in systems with at least k>1
crash failures use algebraic topology or a variant of Sperner's Lemma. In this
paper, we present a generic theorem for proving the impossibility of k-set
agreement in various message passing settings, which is based on a simple
reduction to the consensus impossibility in a certain subsystem. We demonstrate
the broad applicability of our result by exploring the
possibility/impossibility border of k-set agreement in several message-passing
system models: (i) asynchronous systems with crash failures, (ii) partially
synchronous processes with (initial) crash failures, and (iii) asynchronous
systems augmented with failure detectors. In (i) and (ii), the impossibility
part is just an instantiation of our main theorem, whereas the possibility of
achieving k-set agreement in (ii) follows by generalizing the consensus
algorithm for initial crashes by Fisher, Lynch and Patterson. In (iii),
applying our technique yields the exact border for the parameter k where k-set
agreement is solvable with the failure detector class (Sigma_k,Omega_k), for
(1<= k<= n-1), of Bonnet and Raynal. Considering that Sigma_k was shown to be
necessary for solving k-set agreement, this result yields new insights on the

bit commitment scheme utilizing anonymous quantum states and decoy states are
presented. In the first variant, the exact verifying measurement is independent
of the committed bit value, thus the second party can make it before the first
party opens, making possible an unconditional security proof based on
no-cloning. In the second variant, the impossibility proof fails because
quantum entanglement purification of a mixed state does not render the protocol
determinate. Whether impossibility holds in this or similar protocols is an
open question, although preliminary results already show that the impossibility

voting rules are expressed as axioms to be satisfied. This thesis focuses on
axioms concerning strategic manipulation by voters. Sometimes, voters may
intentionally misstate their true preferences in order to alter the outcome for
their own advantage. For example, in plurality rule, if a voter knows that
their top-choice candidate will lose, then they might instead vote for their
second-choice candidate just to avoid an even less desirable result. When no
coalition of voters can strategically manipulate, then the voting rule is said
to satisfy the axiom of Strategy-Proofness. A less restrictive axiom is Weak
Strategy-Proofness (as defined by Dasgupta and Maskin (2019)), which allows for
strategic manipulation by all but the smallest coalitions. Under certain
intuitive conditions, Dasgupta and Maskin (2019) proved that the only voting
rules satisfying Strategy-Proofness are rank-order voting and majority rule. In

216,Distributed Protocols at the Rescue for Trustworthy Online Voting,"While online services emerge in all areas of life, the voting procedure in
many democracies remains paper-based as the security of current online voting
technology is highly disputed. We address the issue of trustworthy online
voting protocols and recall therefore their security concepts with its trust
assumptions. Inspired by the Bitcoin protocol, the prospects of distributed
online voting protocols are analysed. No trusted authority is assumed to ensure
ballot secrecy. Further, the integrity of the voting is enforced by all voters
themselves and without a weakest link, the protocol becomes more robust. We
introduce a taxonomy of notions of distribution in online voting protocols that
we apply on selected online voting protocols. Accordingly, blockchain-based
protocols seem to be promising for online voting due to their similarity with
paper-based protocols.",1705.04480v1,cs.CR,2017-05-12 09:21:36+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Robert Riemann'), arxiv.Result.Author('Stéphane Grumbach')]",

this constraint and have stayed away from their fundamental duty.
Electronic-voting systems are often considered one efficient alternative in

  In this paper, we discuss possible uses of the blockchain technology to
implement a secure and fair voting system. In particular, we introduce a secret
share-based voting system on the blockchain, the so-called SHARVOT protocol.

222,Using Artificial Intelligence to Support Compliance with the General Data Protection Regulation,"The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is a European Union regulation
that will replace the existing Data Protection Directive on 25 May 2018. The
most significant change is a huge increase in the maximum fine that can be
levied for breaches of the regulation. Yet fewer than half of UK companies are
fully aware of GDPR - and a number of those who were preparing for it stopped
doing so when the Brexit vote was announced. A last-minute rush to become
compliant is therefore expected, and numerous companies are starting to offer
advice, checklists and consultancy on how to comply with GDPR. In such an
environment, artificial intelligence technologies ought to be able to assist by
providing best advice; asking all and only the relevant questions; monitoring
activities; and carrying out assessments. The paper considers four areas of
GDPR compliance where rule based technologies and/or machine learning
techniques may be relevant: * Following compliance checklists and codes of
conduct; * Supporting risk assessments; * Complying with the new regulations
regarding technologies that perform automatic profiling; * Complying with the
new regulations concerning recognising and reporting breaches of security. It
concludes that AI technology can support each of these four areas. The
requirements that GDPR (or organisations that need to comply with GDPR) state
for explanation and justification of reasoning imply that rule-based approaches
are likely to be more helpful than machine learning approaches. However, there
may be good business reasons to take a different approach in some
circumstances.",1809.05762v1,cs.AI,2018-09-15 19:57:02+00:00,[arxiv.Result.Author('John KC Kingston')],"Artificial Intelligence and Law (2017) 25, 429 - 443"

practical advantages over other previously known algorithms and isn't bound to
any specific cryptographic concept; so it can be adapted to future
cryptographic exigencies. Compared with other online voting technologies, we
see that this new architecture is less vulnerable to hacker attacks and attacks
from dishonest authorities, given that no sensitive information is stored in
any public server and there is no need for any trustee to safeguard the
legality of the election process. Even in case of an attack succeeding, the
risks associated with the overall election are far lower than with any other
voting system. This architecture can also be combined with any other voting
system, inheriting advantages from both systems.",1603.04228v1,cs.CR,2016-03-14 12:10:47+00:00,[arxiv.Result.Author('Juanjo Bermúdez')],

Compared to classical vote, quantum computed vote is fairer, more democratic
and has stronger expressive power. Since the advantage of quantum computed vote
is neither the speed of computing nor the security of communication, we believe
it opens a new battlefield in the second quantum revolution. Compared to other

technology that is focused on encrypting voter data. By encrypting voter
information rather than cast votes, the system enables various statistical
analyses regarding the vote result while securing the credibility, privacy, and
verifiability of overall e-voting system. We checked the efficiency of the
overall system by comparing the speed of the proposed system with the speed of

226,The Impact of Technologies in Political Campaigns,"Recent political campaigns have demonstrated how technologies are used to
boost election outcomes by microtargeting voters. We propose and analyze a
framework which analyzes how political activists use technologies to target
voters. Voters are represented as nodes of a network. Political activists reach
out locally to voters and try to convince them. Depending on their
technological advantage and budget, political activists target certain regions
in the network where their activities are able to generate the largest
vote-share gains. Analytically and numerically, we quantify vote-share gains
and savings in terms of budget and number of activists from employing superior
targeting technologies compared to traditional campaigns. Moreover, we
demonstrate that the technological precision must surpass a certain threshold
in order to lead to a vote-share gain or budget advantage. Finally, by
calibrating the technology parameters to the recent U.S. presidential election,
we show that a pure targeting technology advantage is consistent with Trump
winning against Clinton.",1909.07644v1,physics.soc-ph,2019-09-17 08:26:04+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Moritz Hoferer'), arxiv.Result.Author('Lucas Böttcher'), arxiv.Result.Author('Hans J.

applications such as smart homes, surveillance, human assistance and health
care. This technology utilises pattern recognition and can contribute to the
development of human-in-the-loop control of different systems such as orthoses

collected from an experiment for a specific purpose. The downsides of this
approach include: 1) it is hard to generalise the outcome to different people
with different biomechanical characteristics and health conditions, and 2) it
cannot be implemented in applications other than the original experiment. To
address these deficiencies, the current study investigates using a publicly
available dataset collected for pathology diagnosis purposes to train Machine
Learning (ML) algorithms. A dataset containing knee motion of participants
performing different exercises has been used to classify human activity. The
algorithms used in this study are Gaussian Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, Random

228,Lie on the Fly: Strategic Voting in an Iterative Preference Elicitation Process,"A voting center is in charge of collecting and aggregating voter preferences.
In an iterative process, the center sends comparison queries to voters,
requesting them to submit their preference between two items. Voters might
discuss the candidates among themselves, figuring out during the elicitation
process which candidates stand a chance of winning and which do not.
Consequently, strategic voters might attempt to manipulate by deviating from
their true preferences and instead submit a different response in order to
attempt to maximize their profit. We provide a practical algorithm for
strategic voters which computes the best manipulative vote and maximizes the
voter's selfish outcome when such a vote exists. We also provide a careful
voting center which is aware of the possible manipulations and avoids
manipulative queries when possible. In an empirical study on four real-world
domains, we show that in practice manipulation occurs in a low percentage of
settings and has a low impact on the final outcome. The careful voting center
reduces manipulation even further, thus allowing for a non-distorted group
decision process to take place. We thus provide a core technology study of a
voting process that can be adopted in opinion or information aggregation
systems and in crowdsourcing applications, e.g., peer grading in Massive Open

AI gets things wrong - an autonomous vehicle crashes; a chatbot exhibits racist
behaviour; automated credit scoring processes discriminate on gender etc. -
there are often significant financial, legal and brand consequences and the
incident becomes major news. As Judea Pearl sees it, the underlying reason for
such mistakes is that, 'all the impressive achievements of deep learning amount
to just curve fitting'. The key, Judea Pearl suggests, is to replace reasoning
by association with causal-reasoning - the ability to infer causes from
observed phenomena. It is a point that was echoed by Gary Marcus and Ernest
Davis in a recent piece for the New York Times: 'we need to stop building
computer systems that merely get better and better at detecting statistical
patterns in data sets - often using an approach known as Deep Learning - and
start building computer systems that from the moment of their assembly innately
grasp three basic concepts: time, space and causality'. In this paper,

Dalrymple and her colleagues note, LFG's f-structure completeness and coherence
constraints fall out as a by-product of the linear logic machinery they propose
for semantic interpretation, thus making those f-structure mechanisms
redundant. Given that linear logic machinery or something like it is
independently needed for semantic interpretation, it seems reasonable to
explore the extent to which it is capable of handling feature structure
constraints as well.
  R-LFG represents the extreme position that all linguistically required
feature structure dependencies can be captured by the resource-accounting
machinery of a linear or similiar logic independently needed for semantic
interpretation, making LFG's unification machinery redundant. The goal is to
show that LFG linguistic analyses can be expressed as clearly and perspicuously
using the smaller set of mechanisms of R-LFG as they can using the much larger

in symbolic computation and it is arguably one of the most important problems
in computational mathematics. The problem has a long history decorated with

However, the worst-case analysis of root-finding algorithms does not correlate
with their practical performance. We develop a smoothed analysis framework for
polynomials with integer coefficients to bridge the gap between the complexity
estimates and the practical performance. In this setting, we derive that the
expected bit complexity of DESCARTES solver to isolate the real roots of a

249,Limiting Risk by Turning Manifest Phantoms into Evil Zombies,"Drawing a random sample of ballots to conduct a risk-limiting audit generally
requires knowing how the ballots cast in an election are organized into groups,
for instance, how many containers of ballots there are in all and how many
ballots are in each container. A list of the ballot group identifiers along
with number of ballots in each group is called a ballot manifest. What if the
ballot manifest is not accurate? Surprisingly, even if ballots are known to be
missing from the manifest, it is not necessary to make worst-case assumptions
about those ballots--for instance, to adjust the margin by the number of
missing ballots--to ensure that the audit remains conservative. Rather, it
suffices to make worst-case assumptions about the individual randomly selected
ballots that the audit cannot find. This observation provides a simple
modification to some risk-limiting audit procedures that makes them
automatically become more conservative if the ballot manifest has errors. The
modification--phantoms to evil zombies (~2EZ)--requires only an upper bound on
the total number of ballots cast. ~2EZ makes the audit P-value stochastically
larger than it would be had the manifest been accurate, automatically requiring
more than enough ballots to be audited to offset the manifest errors. This
ensures that the true risk limit remains smaller than the nominal risk limit.
On the other hand, if the manifest is in fact accurate and the upper bound on
the total number of ballots equals the total according to the manifest, ~2EZ
has no effect at all on the number of ballots audited nor on the true risk
limit.",1207.3413v1,stat.AP,2012-07-14 11:26:02+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Jorge H. Banuelos'), arxiv.Result.Author('Philip B. Stark')]",

selections on a BMD. We then required them to examine their ballots for any
changes from the slate they used to vote. Overall accuracy was exceptionally
high. Participants saw 1440 total contests, and of those 1440, there were a
total of 4 errors, so total accuracy was 99.8%. Participants were able to
perform with near-perfect accuracy regardless of ballot length, ballot type,
number of altered races, and location of altered races. Detection performance
was extremely robust. We conclude that with proper direction and resources,
voters can be near-perfect detectors of ballot changes on printed paper ballots
after voting with a BMD. This finding has significant implications for the
voting community as BMD use continues to grow. Research should now focus on

into subgroups (or districts), the adversary can construct a so-called ""Devil's
Menu"" consisting of several prices. In equilibrium, the adversary can buy the
real ballots of any strict subset of districts at a price corresponding to the
willingness to sell on the part of the citizens holding such ballots. By
contrast, decoy voters are trapped into selling their ballots at a low, or even
negligible, price. Blowing up the adversary's budget by introducing decoy
ballots may thus turn out to be futile. The Devil's Menu can also be applied to
the well-known ""Lemons Problem"".",1712.05477v1,cs.GT,2017-12-14 23:54:58+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Hans Gersbach'), arxiv.Result.Author('Akaki Mamageishvili'), arxiv.Result.Author('Oriol Tejada')]",
254,The ATHENA Class of Risk-Limiting Ballot Polling Audits,"The main risk-limiting ballot polling audit in use today, BRAVO, is designed
for use when single ballots are drawn at random and a decision regarding
whether to stop the audit or draw another ballot is taken after each ballot
draw (ballot-by-ballot (B2) audits). On the other hand, real ballot polling
audits draw many ballots in a single round before determining whether to stop
(round-by-round (R2) audits). We show that BRAVO results in significant
inefficiency when directly applied to real R2 audits. We present the ATHENA
class of R2 stopping rules, which we show are risk-limiting if the round
schedule is pre-determined (before the audit begins). We prove that each rule
is at least as efficient as the corresponding BRAVO stopping rule applied at
the end of the round. We have open-source software libraries implementing most
of our results.
  We show that ATHENA halves the number of ballots required, for all state
margins in the 2016 US Presidential election and a first round with $90\%$
stopping probability, when compared to BRAVO (stopping rule applied at the end
of the round). We present simulation results supporting the 90% stopping
probability claims and our claims for the risk accrued in the first round.
Further, ATHENA reduces the number of ballots by more than a quarter for low
margins, when compared to the BRAVO stopping rule applied on ballots in
selection order. This implies that keeping track of the order when drawing
ballots R2 is not beneficial, because ATHENA is more efficient even without
information on selection order. These results are significant because current
approaches to real ballot polling election audits use the B2 BRAVO rules,
requiring about twice as much work on the part of election officials. Applying
the rules in selection order requires fewer ballots, but keeping track of the
order, and entering it into audit software, adds to the effort.",2008.02315v5,cs.CR,2020-08-05 18:47:37+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Filip Zagórski'), arxiv.Result.Author('Grant McClearn'), arxiv.Result.Author('Sarah Morin'), arxiv.Result.Author('Neal McBurnett'), arxiv.Result.Author('Poorvi L.

Our method involves doing $k$ ""cuts"", each involving moving a random portion of
ballots from the top to the bottom of the stack, and then picking the ballot on
top. Unlike conventional methods of picking a ballot at random, $k$-cut does
not require identification numbers on the ballots or counting many ballots per
draw. We analyze how close the distribution of chosen ballots is to the uniform
distribution, and design different mitigation procedures. We show that $k=6$

different locations, rather than requiring a central authority to select the
sample from the whole population of cast ballots or requiring stratified
sampling; (3) it can start in polling places on election night, before margins
are known. If the reported margins for the 2016 U.S. Presidential election are
correct, a Bernoulli ballot-polling audit with a risk limit of 5% and a
sampling rate of $p_0 = 1\%$ would have had at least a 99% probability of

ballot tilings form a subset in the set of symmetric Dyck tilings, we construct
an inclusive map from labeled trees for ballot tilings to labeled trees for
symmetric Dyck tilings. By this inclusive map, the results for symmetric Dyck
tilings can be applied to those of ballot tilings. We introduce and study the
notions of ballot tableaux and tree-like tableaux of shifted shapes, which are

justifiably high confidence that the reported results of an election are
consistent with an audit trail (""ballots""), which can be paper or electronic.
SOBA combines three ideas: (1) publishing cast vote records (CVRs) separately
for each contest, so that anyone can verify that each reported contest outcome
is correct, if the CVRs reflect voters' intentions with sufficient accuracy;
(2) shrouding a mapping between ballots and the CVRs for those ballots to
prevent the loss of privacy that could occur otherwise; (3) assessing the
accuracy with which the CVRs reflect voters' intentions for a collection of
contests while simultaneously assessing the integrity of the shrouded mapping
between ballots and CVRs by comparing randomly selected ballots to the CVRs
that purport to represent them. Step (1) is related to work by the Humboldt
County Election Transparency Project, but publishing CVRs separately for
individual contests rather than images of entire ballots preserves privacy.
Step (2) requires a cryptographic commitment from elections officials.
Observers participate in step (3), which relies on the ""super-simple
simultaneous single-ballot risk-limiting audit."" Step (3) is designed to reveal
relatively few ballots if the shrouded mapping is proper and the CVRs
accurately reflect voter intent. But if the reported outcomes of the contests
differ from the outcomes that a full hand count would show, step (3) is

Recent studies (e.g., Bernhard, et al. 2020) suggest the verification rate is

of voters being unable to do so accurately or whether this is because voters
simply choose not to attempt verification in the first place. In order to
understand this problem, we conducted an experiment in which 108 participants
participated in a mock election where the BMD displayed the voters' true
choices, but then changed a subset of those choices on the printed ballot. The
design of the printed ballot, the length of the ballot, the number of changes
that were made to the ballot, the location of those changes, and the
instructions provided to the voters were manipulated as part of the experiment.
Results indicated that of those voters who chose to examine the printed ballot,
76% detected anomalies, indicating that voters can reliably detect errors on

traditional plurality voting in which voters submit rankings over the

influence the outcome of an election, given fixed voter preferences. We show
that there exist preference profiles over $k$ candidates such that up to $k-1$
different candidates win at different ballot lengths. We derive exact lower
bounds on the number of voters required for such profiles and provide a
construction matching the lower bound for unrestricted voter preferences.
Additionally, we characterize which sequences of winners are possible over
ballot lengths and provide explicit profile constructions achieving any
feasible winner sequence. We also examine how classic preference restrictions
influence our results--for instance, single-peakedness makes $k-1$ different
winners impossible but still allows at least $\Omega(\sqrt k)$. Finally, we
analyze a collection of 168 real-world elections, where we truncate rankings to
simulate shorter ballots. We find that shorter ballots could have changed the
outcome in one quarter of these elections. Our results highlight ballot length

blind and visually impaired readers because they are predominantly published as

accessibility. We present a browsing approach for print-disabled readers
specifically aimed at such mathematical content. This approach draws on the
navigational mechanisms often used to explore the virtual worlds of text
adventure games with audio-visual sensory substitution for graphical content.
The relative spatial placement of the elements of an equation are represented
as a virtual world, so that the reader can navigate from element to element.
Text elements are announced conventionally using synthesised speech while
graphical elements, such as roots and fraction lines, are rendered using a
modification of the vOICe algorithm. The virtual world allows the reader to
interactively discover the spatial structure of the equation, while the
rendition of graphical elements as sound allows the shape and identity of
elements that cannot be synthesised as speech to be discovered and recognised.
The browsing approach was evaluated by eleven blind and fourteen sighted
participants in a user trial that included the identification of twelve
equations extracted from PDF documents. Overall, equations were identified
completely correctly in 78% of cases (74% and 83% respectively for blind and
sighted subjects). If partial correctness is considered, the performance is
substantially higher. We conclude that the integration of a spatial model

malfunction, the rate will increase noticeably. We show that these approaches
cannot reliably detect outcome-altering problems, because: (i) The number of
possible interactions with BMDs is enormous, so testing interactions uniformly
at random is hopeless. (ii) To probe the space of interactions intelligently
requires an accurate model of voter behavior, but because the space of
interactions is so large, building an accurate model requires observing a huge
number of voters in every jurisdiction in every election--more voters than
there are in most jurisdictions. (iii) Even with a perfect model of voter
behavior, the number of tests needed exceeds the number of voters in most
jurisdictions. (iv) An attacker can target interactions that are expensive to
test, e.g., because they involve voting slowly; or interactions for which
tampering is less likely to be noticed, e.g., because the voter uses the audio
interface. (v) Whether BMDs misbehave or not, the distribution of spoiled
ballots is unknown and varies by election and possibly by ballot style:
historical data do not help much. Hence, there is no way to calibrate a
threshold for passive testing, e.g., to guarantee at least a 95% chance of
noticing that 5% of the votes were altered, with at most a 5% false alarm rate.
(vi) Even if the distribution of spoiled ballots were known to be Poisson, the
vast majority of jurisdictions do not have enough voters for passive testing to
have a large chance of detecting problems but only a small chance of false
alarms.",1908.08144v4,stat.AP,2019-08-21 23:39:04+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Philip B. Stark'), arxiv.Result.Author('Ran Xie')]",

ballots are in each container. A list of the ballot group identifiers along
with number of ballots in each group is called a ballot manifest. What if the
ballot manifest is not accurate? Surprisingly, even if ballots are known to be
missing from the manifest, it is not necessary to make worst-case assumptions
about those ballots--for instance, to adjust the margin by the number of
missing ballots--to ensure that the audit remains conservative. Rather, it
suffices to make worst-case assumptions about the individual randomly selected
ballots that the audit cannot find. This observation provides a simple
modification to some risk-limiting audit procedures that makes them
automatically become more conservative if the ballot manifest has errors. The
modification--phantoms to evil zombies (~2EZ)--requires only an upper bound on
the total number of ballots cast. ~2EZ makes the audit P-value stochastically
larger than it would be had the manifest been accurate, automatically requiring
more than enough ballots to be audited to offset the manifest errors. This
ensures that the true risk limit remains smaller than the nominal risk limit.
On the other hand, if the manifest is in fact accurate and the upper bound on
the total number of ballots equals the total according to the manifest, ~2EZ

273,Can Voters Detect Errors on Their Printed Ballots? Absolutely,"There is still debate on whether voters can detect malicious changes in their
printed ballot after making their selections on a Ballot Marking Device (BMD).
In this study, we altered votes on a voter's ballot after they had made their
selections on a BMD. We then required them to examine their ballots for any
changes from the slate they used to vote. Overall accuracy was exceptionally
high. Participants saw 1440 total contests, and of those 1440, there were a
total of 4 errors, so total accuracy was 99.8%. Participants were able to
perform with near-perfect accuracy regardless of ballot length, ballot type,
number of altered races, and location of altered races. Detection performance
was extremely robust. We conclude that with proper direction and resources,
voters can be near-perfect detectors of ballot changes on printed paper ballots
after voting with a BMD. This finding has significant implications for the
voting community as BMD use continues to grow. Research should now focus on
identifying administrative and behavioral methods that will prompt and

the incentives for a voter to rank any other candidate equal to or ahead of his

Favorite Betrayal Criterion"" (SFBC). Methods satisfying our strategic criteria
can be classified into four categories, according to their geometrical
properties. We prove that two categories of methods are highly restricted and
closely related to positional methods (point systems) that give equal points to
a voter's first and second choices. The third category is tightly restricted,
but if criteria are relaxed slightly a variety of interesting methods can be
identified. Finally, we show that methods in the fourth category are largely
irrelevant to public elections. Interestingly, most of these methods for
satisfying the SFBC do so only ``weakly,"" in that these methods make no
meaningful distinction between the first and second place on the ballot.
However, when we relax our conditions and allow (but do not require) equal
rankings for first place, a wider range of voting methods are possible, and
these methods do indeed make meaningful distinctions between first and second

malevolent adversary trying to buy real ballots. If the citizenry is divided
into subgroups (or districts), the adversary can construct a so-called ""Devil's
Menu"" consisting of several prices. In equilibrium, the adversary can buy the
real ballots of any strict subset of districts at a price corresponding to the
willingness to sell on the part of the citizens holding such ballots. By
contrast, decoy voters are trapped into selling their ballots at a low, or even
negligible, price. Blowing up the adversary's budget by introducing decoy
ballots may thus turn out to be futile. The Devil's Menu can also be applied to

In this paper audio-based automated surveillance methods are organized into a

279,The ATHENA Class of Risk-Limiting Ballot Polling Audits,"The main risk-limiting ballot polling audit in use today, BRAVO, is designed
for use when single ballots are drawn at random and a decision regarding
whether to stop the audit or draw another ballot is taken after each ballot
draw (ballot-by-ballot (B2) audits). On the other hand, real ballot polling
audits draw many ballots in a single round before determining whether to stop
(round-by-round (R2) audits). We show that BRAVO results in significant
inefficiency when directly applied to real R2 audits. We present the ATHENA
class of R2 stopping rules, which we show are risk-limiting if the round
schedule is pre-determined (before the audit begins). We prove that each rule
is at least as efficient as the corresponding BRAVO stopping rule applied at
the end of the round. We have open-source software libraries implementing most
of our results.
  We show that ATHENA halves the number of ballots required, for all state
margins in the 2016 US Presidential election and a first round with $90\%$
stopping probability, when compared to BRAVO (stopping rule applied at the end
of the round). We present simulation results supporting the 90% stopping
probability claims and our claims for the risk accrued in the first round.
Further, ATHENA reduces the number of ballots by more than a quarter for low
margins, when compared to the BRAVO stopping rule applied on ballots in
selection order. This implies that keeping track of the order when drawing
ballots R2 is not beneficial, because ATHENA is more efficient even without
information on selection order. These results are significant because current
approaches to real ballot polling election audits use the B2 BRAVO rules,
requiring about twice as much work on the part of election officials. Applying
the rules in selection order requires fewer ballots, but keeping track of the
order, and entering it into audit software, adds to the effort.",2008.02315v5,cs.CR,2020-08-05 18:47:37+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Filip Zagórski'), arxiv.Result.Author('Grant McClearn'), arxiv.Result.Author('Sarah Morin'), arxiv.Result.Author('Neal McBurnett'), arxiv.Result.Author('Poorvi L.

counting mistakes made during audits.
  Moreover, we present and analyze a simple approximate sampling

Our method involves doing $k$ ""cuts"", each involving moving a random portion of
ballots from the top to the bottom of the stack, and then picking the ballot on
top. Unlike conventional methods of picking a ballot at random, $k$-cut does
not require identification numbers on the ballots or counting many ballots per
draw. We analyze how close the distribution of chosen ballots is to the uniform
distribution, and design different mitigation procedures. We show that $k=6$

it does not require a ballot manifest; (2) it can be conducted independently at
different locations, rather than requiring a central authority to select the
sample from the whole population of cast ballots or requiring stratified
sampling; (3) it can start in polling places on election night, before margins
are known. If the reported margins for the 2016 U.S. Presidential election are
correct, a Bernoulli ballot-polling audit with a risk limit of 5% and a
sampling rate of $p_0 = 1\%$ would have had at least a 99% probability of
confirming the outcome in 42 states. (The other states were more likely to have
needed to examine additional ballots.) Logistical and security advantages that
auditing in the polling place affords may outweigh the cost of examining more
ballots than some other methods might require.",1812.06361v1,stat.AP,2018-12-15 21:57:23+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Kellie Ottoboni'), arxiv.Result.Author('Matthew Bernhard'), arxiv.Result.Author('J.

symmetric Dyck tiling ribbon (symDTR). We give two definitions of Hermite
histories for symmetric Dyck tilings, and show that they are equivalent by use

ballot tilings form a subset in the set of symmetric Dyck tilings, we construct
an inclusive map from labeled trees for ballot tilings to labeled trees for
symmetric Dyck tilings. By this inclusive map, the results for symmetric Dyck
tilings can be applied to those of ballot tilings. We introduce and study the
notions of ballot tableaux and tree-like tableaux of shifted shapes, which are

justifiably high confidence that the reported results of an election are
consistent with an audit trail (""ballots""), which can be paper or electronic.
SOBA combines three ideas: (1) publishing cast vote records (CVRs) separately
for each contest, so that anyone can verify that each reported contest outcome
is correct, if the CVRs reflect voters' intentions with sufficient accuracy;
(2) shrouding a mapping between ballots and the CVRs for those ballots to
prevent the loss of privacy that could occur otherwise; (3) assessing the
accuracy with which the CVRs reflect voters' intentions for a collection of
contests while simultaneously assessing the integrity of the shrouded mapping
between ballots and CVRs by comparing randomly selected ballots to the CVRs
that purport to represent them. Step (1) is related to work by the Humboldt
County Election Transparency Project, but publishing CVRs separately for
individual contests rather than images of entire ballots preserves privacy.
Step (2) requires a cryptographic commitment from elections officials.
Observers participate in step (3), which relies on the ""super-simple
simultaneous single-ballot risk-limiting audit."" Step (3) is designed to reveal
relatively few ballots if the shrouded mapping is proper and the CVRs
accurately reflect voter intent. But if the reported outcomes of the contests

Recent studies (e.g., Bernhard, et al. 2020) suggest the verification rate is

of voters being unable to do so accurately or whether this is because voters
simply choose not to attempt verification in the first place. In order to
understand this problem, we conducted an experiment in which 108 participants
participated in a mock election where the BMD displayed the voters' true
choices, but then changed a subset of those choices on the printed ballot. The
design of the printed ballot, the length of the ballot, the number of changes
that were made to the ballot, the location of those changes, and the
instructions provided to the voters were manipulated as part of the experiment.
Results indicated that of those voters who chose to examine the printed ballot,
76% detected anomalies, indicating that voters can reliably detect errors on
their ballot if they will simply review it. This suggests that administrative

292,Can Voters Detect Errors on Their Printed Ballots? Absolutely,"There is still debate on whether voters can detect malicious changes in their
printed ballot after making their selections on a Ballot Marking Device (BMD).
In this study, we altered votes on a voter's ballot after they had made their
selections on a BMD. We then required them to examine their ballots for any
changes from the slate they used to vote. Overall accuracy was exceptionally
high. Participants saw 1440 total contests, and of those 1440, there were a
total of 4 errors, so total accuracy was 99.8%. Participants were able to
perform with near-perfect accuracy regardless of ballot length, ballot type,
number of altered races, and location of altered races. Detection performance
was extremely robust. We conclude that with proper direction and resources,
voters can be near-perfect detectors of ballot changes on printed paper ballots
after voting with a BMD. This finding has significant implications for the
voting community as BMD use continues to grow. Research should now focus on
identifying administrative and behavioral methods that will prompt and
encourage voters to check their BMD-generated ballots before they drop them in
the ballot box.",2204.09780v1,cs.HC,2022-04-20 20:40:32+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Philip Kortum'), arxiv.Result.Author('Michael D. Byrne'), arxiv.Result.Author('Chidera O. Azubike'), arxiv.Result.Author('Laura E. Roty')]",

show that decoy ballots may not provide effective protection against a
malevolent adversary trying to buy real ballots. If the citizenry is divided
into subgroups (or districts), the adversary can construct a so-called ""Devil's
Menu"" consisting of several prices. In equilibrium, the adversary can buy the
real ballots of any strict subset of districts at a price corresponding to the
willingness to sell on the part of the citizens holding such ballots. By
contrast, decoy voters are trapped into selling their ballots at a low, or even
negligible, price. Blowing up the adversary's budget by introducing decoy
ballots may thus turn out to be futile. The Devil's Menu can also be applied to
the well-known ""Lemons Problem"".",1712.05477v1,cs.GT,2017-12-14 23:54:58+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Hans Gersbach'), arxiv.Result.Author('Akaki Mamageishvili'), arxiv.Result.Author('Oriol Tejada')]",
295,The ATHENA Class of Risk-Limiting Ballot Polling Audits,"The main risk-limiting ballot polling audit in use today, BRAVO, is designed
for use when single ballots are drawn at random and a decision regarding
whether to stop the audit or draw another ballot is taken after each ballot
draw (ballot-by-ballot (B2) audits). On the other hand, real ballot polling
audits draw many ballots in a single round before determining whether to stop
(round-by-round (R2) audits). We show that BRAVO results in significant
inefficiency when directly applied to real R2 audits. We present the ATHENA
class of R2 stopping rules, which we show are risk-limiting if the round
schedule is pre-determined (before the audit begins). We prove that each rule
is at least as efficient as the corresponding BRAVO stopping rule applied at
the end of the round. We have open-source software libraries implementing most
of our results.
  We show that ATHENA halves the number of ballots required, for all state
margins in the 2016 US Presidential election and a first round with $90\%$
stopping probability, when compared to BRAVO (stopping rule applied at the end
of the round). We present simulation results supporting the 90% stopping
probability claims and our claims for the risk accrued in the first round.
Further, ATHENA reduces the number of ballots by more than a quarter for low
margins, when compared to the BRAVO stopping rule applied on ballots in
selection order. This implies that keeping track of the order when drawing
ballots R2 is not beneficial, because ATHENA is more efficient even without
information on selection order. These results are significant because current
approaches to real ballot polling election audits use the B2 BRAVO rules,
requiring about twice as much work on the part of election officials. Applying
the rules in selection order requires fewer ballots, but keeping track of the
order, and entering it into audit software, adds to the effort.",2008.02315v5,cs.CR,2020-08-05 18:47:37+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Filip Zagórski'), arxiv.Result.Author('Grant McClearn'), arxiv.Result.Author('Sarah Morin'), arxiv.Result.Author('Neal McBurnett'), arxiv.Result.Author('Poorvi L.

counting mistakes made during audits.
  Moreover, we present and analyze a simple approximate sampling
method,""$k$-cut"", for picking a ballot randomly from a stack, without counting.
Our method involves doing $k$ ""cuts"", each involving moving a random portion of
ballots from the top to the bottom of the stack, and then picking the ballot on
top. Unlike conventional methods of picking a ballot at random, $k$-cut does
not require identification numbers on the ballots or counting many ballots per
draw. We analyze how close the distribution of chosen ballots is to the uniform
distribution, and design different mitigation procedures. We show that $k=6$
cuts is enough for an risk-limiting election audit, based on empirical data,

it does not require a ballot manifest; (2) it can be conducted independently at
different locations, rather than requiring a central authority to select the
sample from the whole population of cast ballots or requiring stratified
sampling; (3) it can start in polling places on election night, before margins
are known. If the reported margins for the 2016 U.S. Presidential election are
correct, a Bernoulli ballot-polling audit with a risk limit of 5% and a
sampling rate of $p_0 = 1\%$ would have had at least a 99% probability of

symmetric Dyck tiling ribbon (symDTR). We give two definitions of Hermite
histories for symmetric Dyck tilings, and show that they are equivalent by use
of the correspondence between symDTS operation and an Hermite history. Since
ballot tilings form a subset in the set of symmetric Dyck tilings, we construct
an inclusive map from labeled trees for ballot tilings to labeled trees for
symmetric Dyck tilings. By this inclusive map, the results for symmetric Dyck
tilings can be applied to those of ballot tilings. We introduce and study the
notions of ballot tableaux and tree-like tableaux of shifted shapes, which are

299,SOBA: Secrecy-preserving Observable Ballot-level Audit,"SOBA is an approach to election verification that provides observers with
justifiably high confidence that the reported results of an election are
consistent with an audit trail (""ballots""), which can be paper or electronic.
SOBA combines three ideas: (1) publishing cast vote records (CVRs) separately
for each contest, so that anyone can verify that each reported contest outcome
is correct, if the CVRs reflect voters' intentions with sufficient accuracy;
(2) shrouding a mapping between ballots and the CVRs for those ballots to
prevent the loss of privacy that could occur otherwise; (3) assessing the
accuracy with which the CVRs reflect voters' intentions for a collection of
contests while simultaneously assessing the integrity of the shrouded mapping
between ballots and CVRs by comparing randomly selected ballots to the CVRs
that purport to represent them. Step (1) is related to work by the Humboldt
County Election Transparency Project, but publishing CVRs separately for
individual contests rather than images of entire ballots preserves privacy.
Step (2) requires a cryptographic commitment from elections officials.
Observers participate in step (3), which relies on the ""super-simple
simultaneous single-ballot risk-limiting audit."" Step (3) is designed to reveal
relatively few ballots if the shrouded mapping is proper and the CVRs
accurately reflect voter intent. But if the reported outcomes of the contests
differ from the outcomes that a full hand count would show, step (3) is

300,"Voter Verification of BMD Ballots Is a Two-Part Question: Can They? Mostly, They Can. Do They? Mostly, They Don't","The question of whether or not voters actually verify ballots produced by
ballot marking devices (BMDs) is presently the subject of some controversy.
Recent studies (e.g., Bernhard, et al. 2020) suggest the verification rate is
low. What is not clear from previous research is whether this is more a result
of voters being unable to do so accurately or whether this is because voters
simply choose not to attempt verification in the first place. In order to
understand this problem, we conducted an experiment in which 108 participants
participated in a mock election where the BMD displayed the voters' true
choices, but then changed a subset of those choices on the printed ballot. The
design of the printed ballot, the length of the ballot, the number of changes
that were made to the ballot, the location of those changes, and the
instructions provided to the voters were manipulated as part of the experiment.
Results indicated that of those voters who chose to examine the printed ballot,
76% detected anomalies, indicating that voters can reliably detect errors on
their ballot if they will simply review it. This suggests that administrative
remedies, rather than attempts to alter fundamental human perceptual
capabilities, could be employed to encourage voters to check their ballots,

traditional plurality voting in which voters submit rankings over the
candidates rather than single votes. In practice, elections using IRV often
restrict the ballot length, the number of candidates a voter is allowed to rank
on their ballot. We theoretically and empirically analyze how ballot length can
influence the outcome of an election, given fixed voter preferences. We show
that there exist preference profiles over $k$ candidates such that up to $k-1$
different candidates win at different ballot lengths. We derive exact lower
bounds on the number of voters required for such profiles and provide a
construction matching the lower bound for unrestricted voter preferences.
Additionally, we characterize which sequences of winners are possible over
ballot lengths and provide explicit profile constructions achieving any
feasible winner sequence. We also examine how classic preference restrictions
influence our results--for instance, single-peakedness makes $k-1$ different
winners impossible but still allows at least $\Omega(\sqrt k)$. Finally, we
analyze a collection of 168 real-world elections, where we truncate rankings to
simulate shorter ballots. We find that shorter ballots could have changed the
outcome in one quarter of these elections. Our results highlight ballot length

violation in supersymmetric scenarios, which together with neutrino mass and
mixing define the framework of see-saw phenomenology. Several examples are
given, both phenomenological and GUT-related. Variants of the see-saw mechanism
like the type II or triplet see-saw are also discussed. In particular, we
compare many general aspects regarding the dependence of LFV on low energy
neutrino parameters in the extreme cases of a dominating conventional see-saw
term or a dominating triplet term. For instance, the absence of mu -> e gamma

neutrino oscillations. Scanning models, we also find that among the decays mu

meaning observers cannot wait until seeing conditions are optimal before taking
measurements, means that many ground-based solar flare observations are marred
with bad seeing. To combat this, we propose a method for dedicated flare seeing
correction based on training a deep neural network to learn to correct
artificial seeing from flare observations taken during good seeing conditions.
This model uses transfer learning, a novel technique in solar physics, to help
learn these corrections. Transfer learning is when another network already
trained on similar data is used to influence the learning of the new network.
Once trained, the model has been applied to two flare datasets: one from

320,Typical duration of good seeing sequences at Concordia,"Context: The winter seeing at Concordia is essentially bimodal, excellent or
quite poor, with relative proportions that depend on altitude above the snow
surface. This paper studies the temporal behavior of the good seeing sequences.
Aims: An efficient exploitation of extremely good seeing with an adaptive
optics system needs long integrations. It is then important to explore the
temporal distribution of the fraction of time providing excellent seeing.
Methods: Temporal windows of good seeing are created by a simple binary
process. Good or bad. Their autocorrelations are corrected for those of the
existing data sets, since these are not continuous, being often interrupted by
technical problems in addition to the adverse weather gaps. At the end these
corrected autocorrelations provide the typical duration of good seeing
sequences. This study has to be a little detailed as its results depend on the
season, summer or winter. Results: Using a threshold of 0.5 arcsec to define
the ""good seeing"", three characteristic numbers are found to describe the
temporal evolution of the good seeing windows. The first number is the mean
duration of an uninterrupted good seeing sequence: it is $\tau_0=7.5$ hours at
8 m above the ground (15 hours at 20 m). These sequences are randomly
distributed in time, with a negative exponential law of damping time
$\tau_1=29$ hours (at elevation 8 m and 20 m). The third number is the mean
time between two 29 hours episodes. It is T=10 days at 8 m high (5 days at 20
m).",1003.3583v1,astro-ph.IM,2010-03-18 14:09:06+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Eric Fossat'), arxiv.Result.Author('Eric Aristidi'), arxiv.Result.Author('Karim Agabi'), arxiv.Result.Author('Erick Bondoux'), arxiv.Result.Author('Zalpha Challita'), arxiv.Result.Author('Francois Jeanneaux'), arxiv.Result.Author('Djamel Mekarnia')]",
321,Excellent daytime seeing at Dome Fuji on the Antarctic plateau,"Context. Dome Fuji, the second highest region on the Antarctic plateau, is
expected to have some of the best astronomical seeing on Earth. However, site
testing at Dome Fuji is still in its very early stages.
  Aims. To investigate the astronomical seeing in the free atmosphere above
Dome Fuji, and to determine the height of the surface boundary layer.
  Methods. A Differential Image Motion Monitor was used to measure the seeing
in the visible (472 nm) at a height of 11 m above the snow surface at Dome Fuji
during the austral summer of 2012/2013.
  Results. Seeing below 0.2'' has been observed. The seeing often has a local
minimum of ~0.3'' near 18 h local time. Some periods of excellent seeing, 0.3''
or smaller, were also observed, sometimes extending for several hours at local
midnight. The median seeing is higher, at 0.52''---this large value is believed
to be caused by periods when the telescope was within the turbulent boundary
layer.
  Conclusions. The diurnal variation of the daytime seeing at Dome Fuji is
similar to that reported for Dome C, and the height of the surface boundary
layer is consistent with previous simulations for Dome Fuji. The free
atmosphere seeing is ~0.2'', and the height of the surface boundary layer can
be as low as ~11 m.",1305.5109v1,astro-ph.IM,2013-05-22 12:38:07+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('H. Okita'), arxiv.Result.Author('T. Ichikawa'), arxiv.Result.Author('M. C. B. Ashley'), arxiv.Result.Author('N. Takato')]",
322,Night-time measurements of astronomical seeing at Dome A in Antarctica,"Seeing, the angular size of stellar images blurred by atmospheric turbulence,
is a critical parameter used to assess the quality of astronomical sites.
Median values at the best mid-latitude sites are generally in the range of
0.6--0.8\,arcsec. Sites on the Antarctic plateau are characterized by
comparatively-weak turbulence in the free-atmosphere above a strong but thin
boundary layer. The median seeing at Dome C is estimated to be 0.23--0.36
arcsec above a boundary layer that has a typical height of 30\,m. At Dome A and
F, the only previous seeing measurements were made during daytime. Here we
report the first direct measurements of night-time seeing at Dome A, using a
Differential Image Motion Monitor. Located at a height of just 8\,m, it
recorded seeing as low as 0.13\,arcsec, and provided seeing statistics that are
comparable to those for a 20\,m height at Dome C. It indicates that the
boundary layer was below 8\,m 31\% of the time. At such times the median seeing
was 0.31\,arcsec, consistent with free-atmosphere seeing. The seeing and
boundary layer thickness are found to be strongly correlated with the
near-surface temperature gradient. The correlation confirms a median thickness
of approximately 14\,m for the boundary layer at Dome A, as found from a sonic
radar. The thinner boundary layer makes it less challenging to locate a
telescope above it, thereby giving greater access to the free-atmosphere.",2007.15365v1,astro-ph.IM,2020-07-30 10:36:24+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Bin Ma'), arxiv.Result.Author('Zhaohui Shang'), arxiv.Result.Author('Yi Hu'), arxiv.Result.Author('Keliang Hu'), arxiv.Result.Author('Yongjiang Wang'), arxiv.Result.Author('Xu Yang'), arxiv.Result.Author('Michael C.

323,Gaze-Vergence-Controlled See-Through Vision in Augmented Reality,"Augmented Reality (AR) see-through vision is an interesting research topic
since it enables users to see through a wall and see the occluded objects. Most
existing research focuses on the visual effects of see-through vision, while
the interaction method is less studied. However, we argue that using common
interaction modalities, e.g., midair click and speech, may not be the optimal
way to control see-through vision. This is because when we want to see through
something, it is physically related to our gaze depth/vergence and thus should
be naturally controlled by the eyes. Following this idea, this paper proposes a
novel gaze-vergence-controlled (GVC) see-through vision technique in AR. Since
gaze depth is needed, we build a gaze tracking module with two infrared cameras
and the corresponding algorithm and assemble it into the Microsoft HoloLens 2
to achieve gaze depth estimation. We then propose two different GVC modes for
see-through vision to fit different scenarios. Extensive experimental results
demonstrate that our gaze depth estimation is efficient and accurate. By
comparing with conventional interaction modalities, our GVC techniques are also
shown to be superior in terms of efficiency and more preferred by users.
Finally, we present four example applications of gaze-vergence-controlled
see-through vision.",2207.02645v1,cs.CV,2022-07-06 13:11:34+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Zhimin Wang'), arxiv.Result.Author('Yuxin Zhao'), arxiv.Result.Author('Feng Lu')]",

the plasma sheath considering electron induced secondary electron emission

in a range of plasma simulations, here improved SEE model of a charged
dielectric wall is constructed which includes the wall charging effect on SEE
coefficient and the energy dependency of SEE coefficient. Pertinent algorithms
to implement above SEE model in plasma simulation are studied in detail. It is
found that the SEE coefficient increases with the amount of negative wall
charges, which in turn reduces the emissive sheath potential. With energy
dependent SEE coefficient, the sheath potential is a nonlinear function of the
plasma electron temperature, as opposed to the linear relation predicted by
classic emissive sheath theory. Simulation combining both wall charging effect
and SEE coefficient energy dependency suggests that the space charged limited
sheath is formed at high plasma electron temperature levels, where both sheath
potential and surface charging saturate. Additionally, different algorithms to
implement the backscattering in kinetic simulation are tested and compared.
Converting backscattered electron to secondary electron via an effective SEE
coefficient barely affects the sheath properties. The simulation results are
shown to be commensurate with the upgraded sheath theory predictions.",2209.09567v1,physics.plasm-ph,2022-09-20 09:13:56+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Guang-Yu Sun'), arxiv.Result.Author('Shu Zhang'), arxiv.Result.Author('Bao-Hong Guo'), arxiv.Result.Author('An-Bang Sun'), arxiv.Result.Author('Guan-Jun Zhang')]",

340,"Algorithmic audits of algorithms, and the law","Algorithmic decision making is now widespread, ranging from health care
allocation to more common actions such as recommendation or information
ranking. The aim to audit these algorithms has grown alongside. In this paper,
we focus on external audits that are conducted by interacting with the user
side of the target algorithm, hence considered as a black box. Yet, the legal
framework in which these audits take place is mostly ambiguous to researchers
developing them: on the one hand, the legal value of the audit outcome is
uncertain; on the other hand the auditors' rights and obligations are unclear.
The contribution of this paper is to articulate two canonical audit forms to
law, to shed light on these aspects: 1) the first audit form (we coin the Bobby
audit form) checks a predicate against the algorithm, while the second
(Sherlock) is more loose and opens up to multiple investigations. We find that:
Bobby audits are more amenable to prosecution, yet are delicate as operating on
real user data. This can lead to reject by a court (notion of admissibility).
Sherlock audits craft data for their operation, most notably to build
surrogates of the audited algorithm. It is mostly used for acts for
whistleblowing, as even if accepted as a proof, the evidential value will be
low in practice. 2) these two forms require the prior respect of a proper right
to audit, granted by law or by the platform being audited; otherwise the
auditor will be also prone to prosecutions regardless of the audit outcome.

344,Auditable Restoration of Distributed Programs,"We focus on a protocol for auditable restoration of distributed systems. The
need for such protocol arises due to conflicting requirements (e.g., access to
the system should be restricted but emergency access should be provided). One
can design such systems with a tamper detection approach (based on the
intuition of ""break the glass door""). However, in a distributed system, such
tampering, which are denoted as auditable events, is visible only for a single
node. This is unacceptable since the actions they take in these situations can
be different than those in the normal mode. Moreover, eventually, the auditable
event needs to be cleared so that system resumes the normal operation.
  With this motivation, in this paper, we present a protocol for auditable
restoration, where any process can potentially identify an auditable event.
Whenever a new auditable event occurs, the system must reach an ""auditable
state"" where every process is aware of the auditable event. Only after the
system reaches an auditable state, it can begin the operation of restoration.
Although any process can observe an auditable event, we require that only
""authorized"" processes can begin the task of restoration. Moreover, these
processes can begin the restoration only when the system is in an auditable
state. Our protocol is self-stabilizing and has bounded state space. It can
effectively handle the case where faults or auditable events occur during the
restoration protocol. Moreover, it can be used to provide auditable restoration
to other distributed protocol.",1506.07957v1,cs.DC,2015-06-26 04:52:24+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Reza Hajisheykhi'), arxiv.Result.Author('Mohammad Roohitavaf'), arxiv.Result.Author('Sandeep Kulkarni')]",
345,Extricating IoT Devices from Vendor Infrastructure with Karl,"Most consumer IoT devices are vertically integrated with cloud-side
infrastructure. Such architectures present enormous risk to user data,
exacerbated by vendor heterogeneity and the inability for users to audit

hardware, providing users control over how their data is processed and why it
can be shared with other devices or the Internet.
  Karl is a new smart-home framework designed to host IoT computation and
storage on user-chosen devices. A key insight in Karl's modular programming
model is that a familiar interface (inspired by serverless) can capture most
modern cloud-side IoT components under a single framework, which executes
modules agnostic of hardware location. While local hosting eliminates many
flows, modularity enables all remaining flows to be justified using
fine-grained primitives. We introduce two IoT security mechanisms: pipeline
permissions that permit device data to be shared given some justification and
exit policies that block flows unless specific conditions are met. We evaluate

348,Keys in the Clouds: Auditable Multi-device Access to Cryptographic Credentials,"Personal cryptographic keys are the foundation of many secure services, but
storing these keys securely is a challenge, especially if they are used from
multiple devices. Storing keys in a centralized location, like an
Internet-accessible server, raises serious security concerns (e.g. server
compromise). Hardware-based Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) are a
well-known solution for protecting sensitive data in untrusted environments,
and are now becoming available on commodity server platforms.
  Although the idea of protecting keys using a server-side TEE is
straight-forward, in this paper we validate this approach and show that it
enables new desirable functionality. We describe the design, implementation,
and evaluation of a TEE-based Cloud Key Store (CKS), an online service for
securely generating, storing, and using personal cryptographic keys. Using
remote attestation, users receive strong assurance about the behaviour of the
CKS, and can authenticate themselves using passwords while avoiding typical
risks of password-based authentication like password theft or phishing. In
addition, this design allows users to i) define policy-based access controls
for keys; ii) delegate keys to other CKS users for a specified time and/or a
limited number of uses; and iii) audit all key usages via a secure audit log.
We have implemented a proof of concept CKS using Intel SGX and integrated this
into GnuPG on Linux and OpenKeychain on Android. Our CKS implementation
performs approximately 6,000 signature operations per second on a single

suspicious events in computing systems, allowing machine operators to detect
and subsequently investigate security incidents. While auditing has proven
invaluable to the security of traditional computers, existing audit frameworks
are rarely designed with consideration for Real-Time Systems (RTS). The
transparency provided by system auditing would be of tremendous benefit in a
variety of security-critical RTS domains, (e.g., autonomous vehicles); however,
if audit mechanisms are not carefully integrated into RTS, auditing can be
rendered ineffectual and violate the real-world temporal requirements of the
RTS.
  In this paper, we demonstrate how to adapt commodity audit frameworks to RTS.
Using Linux Audit as a case study, we first demonstrate that the volume of
audit events generated by commodity frameworks is unsustainable within the
temporal and resource constraints of real-time (RT) applications. To address
this, we present Ellipsis, a set of kernel-based reduction techniques that
leverage the periodic repetitive nature of RT applications to aggressively
reduce the costs of system-level auditing. Ellipsis generates succinct

353,Harpocrates: Privacy-Preserving and Immutable Audit Log for Sensitive Data Operations,"The audit log is a crucial component to monitor fine-grained operations over
sensitive data (e.g., personal, health) for security inspection and assurance.
Since such data operations can be highly sensitive, it is vital to ensure that
the audit log achieves not only validity and immutability, but also
confidentiality against active threats to standard data regulations (e.g.,
HIPAA) compliance. Despite its critical needs, state-of-the-art
privacy-preserving audit log schemes (e.g., Ghostor (NSDI '20), Calypso (VLDB
'19)) do not fully obtain a high level of privacy, integrity, and immutability
simultaneously, in which certain information (e.g., user identities) is still
leaked in the log.
  In this paper, we propose Harpocrates, a new privacy-preserving and immutable
audit log scheme. Harpocrates permits data store, share, and access operations
to be recorded in the audit log without leaking sensitive information (e.g.,
data identifier, user identity), while permitting the validity of data
operations to be publicly verifiable. Harpocrates makes use of blockchain
techniques to achieve immutability and avoid a single point of failure, while
cryptographic zero-knowledge proofs are harnessed for confidentiality and
public verifiability. We analyze the security of our proposed technique and
prove that it achieves non-malleability and indistinguishability. We fully

354,FOX: Hardware-Assisted File Auditing for Direct Access NVM-Hosted Filesystems,"With emerging non-volatile memories entering the mainstream market, several
operating systems start to incorporate new changes and optimizations. One major
OS support is the direct-access for files, which enables efficient access for
files hosted in byte-addressable NVM systems. With DAX-enabled filesystems,
files can be accessed directly similar to memory with typical load/store
operations. Despite its efficiency, the frequently used system call of direct
access is troublesome for system auditing. File system auditing is mandatory
and widely used because auditing logs can help detect anomalies, suspicious
file accesses, or be used as an evidence in digital forensics. However, the
frequent and long-time usage of direct access call blinds the operating system
or file system from tracking process operations to shared files after the
initial page faults. This might results in imprecise casualty analysis and
leads to false conclusion for attack detection. To remedy the tension between
enabling fine-grained file system auditing and leveraging the performance of
NVM-hosted file systems, we propose a novel hardware-assisted auditing scheme,
FOX. FOX enables file system auditing through lightweight hardware-software
changes which can monitor every read or write event for mapped files on NVM.
Additionally, we propose the optimized schemes, that enable auditing
flexibility for selected files/memory range. By prototyping FOX on a full
system simulator, Gem5, we observe a relatively small reduced throughput and an
acceptable extra writes compared to our baseline. Compared to other
instrumentation-based software schemes, our scheme is low-overhead and secure.",2104.08699v2,cs.AR,2021-04-18 03:47:40+00:00,[arxiv.Result.Author('Mao Ye')],

contain multiple predicates. For the range query, we boosted the speed for at
least one order of magnitude. The storage usage is reduced by 25%. Conclusion:

358,Get Your Workload in Order: Game Theoretic Prioritization of Database Auditing,"For enhancing the privacy protections of databases, where the increasing
amount of detailed personal data is stored and processed, multiple mechanisms
have been developed, such as audit logging and alert triggers, which notify
administrators about suspicious activities; however, the two main limitations
in common are: 1) the volume of such alerts is often substantially greater than
the capabilities of resource-constrained organizations, and 2) strategic
attackers may disguise their actions or carefully choosing which records they
touch, making incompetent the statistical detection models. For solving them,
we introduce a novel approach to database auditing that explicitly accounts for
adversarial behavior by 1) prioritizing the order in which types of alerts are
investigated and 2) providing an upper bound on how much resource to allocate
for each type. We model the interaction between a database auditor and
potential attackers as a Stackelberg game in which the auditor chooses an
auditing policy and attackers choose which records to target. A corresponding
approach combining linear programming, column generation, and heuristic search
is proposed to derive an auditing policy. For testing the policy-searching
performance, a publicly available credit card application dataset are adopted,
on which it shows that our methods produce high-quality mixed strategies as

359,Strategic Signaling for Utility Control in Audit Games,"As an effective method to protect the daily access to sensitive data against
malicious attacks, the audit mechanism has been widely deployed in various
practical fields. In order to examine security vulnerabilities and prevent the
leakage of sensitive data in a timely manner, the database logging system
usually employs an online signaling scheme to issue an alert when suspicious
access is detected. Defenders can audit alerts to reduce potential damage. This
interaction process between a defender and an attacker can be modeled as an
audit game. In previous studies, it was found that sending real-time signals in
the audit game to warn visitors can improve the benefits of the defender.
However, the previous approaches usually assume perfect information of the
attacker, or simply concentrate on the utility of the defender. In this paper,
we introduce a brand-new zero-determinant (ZD) strategy to study the sequential
audit game with online signaling, which empowers the defender to unilaterally
control the utility of visitors when accessing sensitive data. In addition, an
optimization scheme based on the ZD strategy is designed to effectively
maximize the utility difference between the defender and the attacker.
Extensive simulation results show that our proposed scheme enhances the
security management and control capabilities of the defender to better handle
different access requests and safeguard the system security in a cost-efficient

360,To Warn or Not to Warn: Online Signaling in Audit Games,"Routine operational use of sensitive data is often governed by law and
regulation. For instance, in the medical domain, there are various statues at
the state and federal level that dictate who is permitted to work with
patients' records and under what conditions. To screen for potential privacy
breaches, logging systems are usually deployed to trigger alerts whenever
suspicious access is detected. However, such mechanisms are often inefficient
because 1) the vast majority of triggered alerts are false positives, 2) small
budgets make it unlikely that a real attack will be detected, and 3) attackers
can behave strategically, such that traditional auditing mechanisms cannot
easily catch them. To improve efficiency, information systems may invoke
signaling, so that whenever a suspicious access request occurs, the system can,
in real time, warn the user that the access may be audited. Then, at the close
of a finite period, a selected subset of suspicious accesses are audited. This
gives rise to an online problem in which one needs to determine 1) whether a
warning should be triggered and 2) the likelihood that the data request event
will be audited. In this paper, we formalize this auditing problem as a
Signaling Audit Game (SAG), in which we model the interactions between an
auditor and an attacker in the context of signaling and the usability cost is
represented as a factor of the auditor's payoff. We study the properties of its
Stackelberg equilibria and develop a scalable approach to compute its solution.
We show that a strategic presentation of warnings adds value in that SAGs
realize significantly higher utility for the auditor than systems without
signaling. We illustrate the value of the proposed auditing model and the
consistency of its advantages over existing baseline methods.",1905.06946v2,cs.CR,2019-05-16 05:08:51+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Chao Yan'), arxiv.Result.Author('Haifeng Xu'), arxiv.Result.Author('Yevgeniy Vorobeychik'), arxiv.Result.Author('Bo Li'), arxiv.Result.Author('Daniel Fabbri'), arxiv.Result.Author('Bradley Malin')]",

precisely positions the nodes matched with log records on the corresponding
CFGs and connects the nodes with as few backtracks as possible. Our experiments

ability to trace back longer sequences of system events in (near) real-time to
help identify and isolate attacks. Equally important, both AIQL and SAQL are
not available for public use, whereas GrAALF is open-source. GrAALF offers the
choice of compactly storing the logs in main memory, in a relational database
system, in a hybrid main memory-database system, and a graph-based database. We
compare the responsiveness of each of these options, using multiple huge
system-call log files. Next, in multiple real-world attack scenarios, we
demonstrate the efficacy and usefulness of GrAALF in identifying the attack and
discovering its provenance. Consequently, GrAALF offers a robust solution for
analysis of audit logs to support computer forensics.",1909.00902v2,cs.CR,2019-09-03 00:44:17+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Omid Setayeshfar'), arxiv.Result.Author('Christian Adkins'), arxiv.Result.Author('Matthew Jones'), arxiv.Result.Author('Kyu Hyung Lee'), arxiv.Result.Author('Prashant Doshi')]",
366,A Logical Method for Policy Enforcement over Evolving Audit Logs,"We present an iterative algorithm for enforcing policies represented in a
first-order logic, which can, in particular, express all transmission-related
clauses in the HIPAA Privacy Rule. The logic has three features that raise
challenges for enforcement --- uninterpreted predicates (used to model
subjective concepts in privacy policies), real-time temporal properties, and
quantification over infinite domains (such as the set of messages containing
personal information). The algorithm operates over audit logs that are
inherently incomplete and evolve over time. In each iteration, the algorithm
provably checks as much of the policy as possible over the current log and
outputs a residual policy that can only be checked when the log is extended
with additional information. We prove correctness and termination properties of
the algorithm. While these results are developed in a general form, accounting
for many different sources of incompleteness in audit logs, we also prove that
for the special case of logs that maintain a complete record of all relevant
actions, the algorithm effectively enforces all safety and co-safety
properties. The algorithm can significantly help automate enforcement of
policies derived from the HIPAA Privacy Rule.",1102.2521v3,cs.LO,2011-02-12 15:24:24+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Deepak Garg'), arxiv.Result.Author('Limin Jia'), arxiv.Result.Author('Anupam Datta')]",
367,"Think Global, Act Local: Gossip and Client Audits in Verifiable Data Structures","In recent years, there has been increasing recognition of the benefits of
having services provide auditable logs of data, as demonstrated by the
deployment of Certificate Transparency and the development of other
transparency projects. Most proposed systems, however, rely on a gossip
protocol by which users can be assured that they have the same view of the log,
but the few gossip protocols that do exist today are not suited for near-term
deployment. Furthermore, they assume the presence of global sets of auditors,
who must be blindly trusted to correctly perform their roles, in order to
achieve their stated transparency goals. In this paper, we address both of
these issues by proposing a gossip protocol and a verifiable registry, Mog, in
which users can perform their own auditing themselves. We prove the security of
our protocols and demonstrate via experimental evaluations that they are
performant in a variety of potential near-term deployments.",2011.04551v1,cs.CR,2020-11-09 16:50:07+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Sarah Meiklejohn'), arxiv.Result.Author('Pavel Kalinnikov'), arxiv.Result.Author('Cindy S.

368,Verifiable Light-Weight Monitoring for Certificate Transparency Logs,"Trust in publicly verifiable Certificate Transparency (CT) logs is reduced
through cryptography, gossip, auditing, and monitoring. The role of a monitor
is to observe each and every log entry, looking for suspicious certificates
that interest the entity running the monitor. While anyone can run a monitor,
it requires continuous operation and copies of the logs to be inspected. This
has lead to the emergence of monitoring-as-a-service: a trusted party runs the
monitor and provides registered subjects with selective certificate
notifications, e.g., ""notify me of all foo.com certificates"". We present a
CT/bis extension for verifiable light-weight monitoring that enables subjects
to verify the correctness of such notifications, reducing the trust that is
placed in these monitors. Our extension supports verifiable monitoring of
wild-card domains and piggybacks on CT's existing gossip-audit security model.",1711.03952v2,cs.CR,2017-11-10 18:27:23+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Rasmus Dahlberg'), arxiv.Result.Author('Tobias Pulls')]",
