0,Risk Automatic Prediction for Social Economy Companies using Camels,"Governments have to supervise and inspect social economy enterprises (SEEs).
However, inspecting all SEEs is not possible due to the large number of SEEs
and the low number of inspectors in general. We proposed a prediction model
based on a machine learning approach. The method was trained with the random
forest algorithm with historical data provided by each SEE. Three consecutive
periods of data were concatenated. The proposed method uses these periods as
input data and predicts the risk of each SEE in the fourth period. The model
achieved 76\% overall accuracy. In addition, it obtained good accuracy in
predicting the high risk of a SEE. We found that the legal nature and the
variation of the past-due portfolio are good predictors of the future risk of a
SEE. Thus, the risk of a SEE in a future period can be predicted by a
supervised machine learning method. Predicting the high risk of a SEE improves
the daily work of each inspector by focusing only on high-risk SEEs.",2210.05052v1,cs.LG,2022-10-10 23:50:02+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Joseph Gallego-Mejia'), arxiv.Result.Author('Daniela Martin-Vega'), arxiv.Result.Author('Fabio Gonzalez')]",

3,"The see-saw mechanism: neutrino mixing, leptogenesis and lepton flavor violation","The see-saw mechanism to generate small neutrino masses is reviewed. After
summarizing our current knowledge about the low energy neutrino mass matrix we
consider reconstructing the see-saw mechanism. Low energy neutrino physics is
not sufficient to reconstruct see-saw, a feature which we refer to as ``see-saw
degeneracy''. Indirect tests of see-saw are leptogenesis and lepton flavor
violation in supersymmetric scenarios, which together with neutrino mass and
mixing define the framework of see-saw phenomenology. Several examples are
given, both phenomenological and GUT-related. Variants of the see-saw mechanism
like the type II or triplet see-saw are also discussed. In particular, we
compare many general aspects regarding the dependence of LFV on low energy
neutrino parameters in the extreme cases of a dominating conventional see-saw
term or a dominating triplet term. For instance, the absence of mu -> e gamma
or tau -> e gamma in the pure triplet case means that CP is conserved in
neutrino oscillations. Scanning models, we also find that among the decays mu
-> e gamma, tau -> e gamma and tau -> mu gamma the latter one has the largest
branching ratio in (i) SO(10) type I see-saw models and in (ii) scenarios in
which the triplet term dominates in the neutrino mass matrix.",0804.3925v3,hep-ph,2008-04-24 13:44:29+00:00,[arxiv.Result.Author('Werner Rodejohann')],"Pramana 72:217-227,2009"
4,Statistics of turbulence profile at Cerro Tololo,"Results of 3-month continuous monitoring of turbulence profile and seeing at
Cerro Tololo (Chile) in May-July 2002 are presented. Some 28000 low-resolution
profiles were measured by a new MASS single-star turbulence monitor,
accompanied by seeing data from DIMM. The median seeing was 0.95 arcseconds.
The first 500 m contribute 60% to the total seeing, the free-atmosphere median
seeing was 0.55 arcseconds. Free-atmosphere seeing is almost never better than
0.15 arcseconds because there is always some turbulence above 12 km. A 4-day
period of calm upper atmosphere with a stable free-atmosphere seeing of 0.2-0.3
arcseconds was noted. A gain in resolution from adaptive compensation of ground
layer will be 1.7 times typically and 2-3 times during such calm periods.
Correlations of the free-atmosphere turbulence with the wind speed at
tropopause and of the ground-layer turbulence with ground wind are studied.
Temporal evolution of turbulence is characterized by recurrent bursts, their
typical duration increases from 15 minutes in low layers to 1-2 hours in high
layers. The large data base of turbulence profiles can be used to test

8,A Machine Learning Approach to Correcting Atmospheric Seeing in Solar Flare Observations,"Current post-processing techniques for the correction of atmospheric seeing
in solar observations -- such as Speckle interferometry and Phase Diversity
methods -- have limitations when it comes to their reconstructive capabilities

meaning observers cannot wait until seeing conditions are optimal before taking

Once trained, the model has been applied to two flare datasets: one from
AR12157 on 2014/09/06 and one from AR12673 on 2017/09/06. The results show good

11,Typical duration of good seeing sequences at Concordia,"Context: The winter seeing at Concordia is essentially bimodal, excellent or
quite poor, with relative proportions that depend on altitude above the snow
surface. This paper studies the temporal behavior of the good seeing sequences.
Aims: An efficient exploitation of extremely good seeing with an adaptive
optics system needs long integrations. It is then important to explore the
temporal distribution of the fraction of time providing excellent seeing.
Methods: Temporal windows of good seeing are created by a simple binary
process. Good or bad. Their autocorrelations are corrected for those of the
existing data sets, since these are not continuous, being often interrupted by
technical problems in addition to the adverse weather gaps. At the end these
corrected autocorrelations provide the typical duration of good seeing
sequences. This study has to be a little detailed as its results depend on the
season, summer or winter. Results: Using a threshold of 0.5 arcsec to define
the ""good seeing"", three characteristic numbers are found to describe the
temporal evolution of the good seeing windows. The first number is the mean
duration of an uninterrupted good seeing sequence: it is $\tau_0=7.5$ hours at
8 m above the ground (15 hours at 20 m). These sequences are randomly
distributed in time, with a negative exponential law of damping time
$\tau_1=29$ hours (at elevation 8 m and 20 m). The third number is the mean
time between two 29 hours episodes. It is T=10 days at 8 m high (5 days at 20
m).",1003.3583v1,astro-ph.IM,2010-03-18 14:09:06+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Eric Fossat'), arxiv.Result.Author('Eric Aristidi'), arxiv.Result.Author('Karim Agabi'), arxiv.Result.Author('Erick Bondoux'), arxiv.Result.Author('Zalpha Challita'), arxiv.Result.Author('Francois Jeanneaux'), arxiv.Result.Author('Djamel Mekarnia')]",
12,Excellent daytime seeing at Dome Fuji on the Antarctic plateau,"Context. Dome Fuji, the second highest region on the Antarctic plateau, is
expected to have some of the best astronomical seeing on Earth. However, site
testing at Dome Fuji is still in its very early stages.
  Aims. To investigate the astronomical seeing in the free atmosphere above
Dome Fuji, and to determine the height of the surface boundary layer.
  Methods. A Differential Image Motion Monitor was used to measure the seeing
in the visible (472 nm) at a height of 11 m above the snow surface at Dome Fuji
during the austral summer of 2012/2013.
  Results. Seeing below 0.2'' has been observed. The seeing often has a local
minimum of ~0.3'' near 18 h local time. Some periods of excellent seeing, 0.3''
or smaller, were also observed, sometimes extending for several hours at local
midnight. The median seeing is higher, at 0.52''---this large value is believed
to be caused by periods when the telescope was within the turbulent boundary
layer.
  Conclusions. The diurnal variation of the daytime seeing at Dome Fuji is
similar to that reported for Dome C, and the height of the surface boundary
layer is consistent with previous simulations for Dome Fuji. The free
atmosphere seeing is ~0.2'', and the height of the surface boundary layer can
be as low as ~11 m.",1305.5109v1,astro-ph.IM,2013-05-22 12:38:07+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('H. Okita'), arxiv.Result.Author('T. Ichikawa'), arxiv.Result.Author('M. C. B. Ashley'), arxiv.Result.Author('N. Takato')]",
13,Night-time measurements of astronomical seeing at Dome A in Antarctica,"Seeing, the angular size of stellar images blurred by atmospheric turbulence,
is a critical parameter used to assess the quality of astronomical sites.
Median values at the best mid-latitude sites are generally in the range of
0.6--0.8\,arcsec. Sites on the Antarctic plateau are characterized by
comparatively-weak turbulence in the free-atmosphere above a strong but thin
boundary layer. The median seeing at Dome C is estimated to be 0.23--0.36
arcsec above a boundary layer that has a typical height of 30\,m. At Dome A and
F, the only previous seeing measurements were made during daytime. Here we
report the first direct measurements of night-time seeing at Dome A, using a
Differential Image Motion Monitor. Located at a height of just 8\,m, it
recorded seeing as low as 0.13\,arcsec, and provided seeing statistics that are
comparable to those for a 20\,m height at Dome C. It indicates that the
boundary layer was below 8\,m 31\% of the time. At such times the median seeing
was 0.31\,arcsec, consistent with free-atmosphere seeing. The seeing and
boundary layer thickness are found to be strongly correlated with the
near-surface temperature gradient. The correlation confirms a median thickness
of approximately 14\,m for the boundary layer at Dome A, as found from a sonic
radar. The thinner boundary layer makes it less challenging to locate a
telescope above it, thereby giving greater access to the free-atmosphere.",2007.15365v1,astro-ph.IM,2020-07-30 10:36:24+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Bin Ma'), arxiv.Result.Author('Zhaohui Shang'), arxiv.Result.Author('Yi Hu'), arxiv.Result.Author('Keliang Hu'), arxiv.Result.Author('Yongjiang Wang'), arxiv.Result.Author('Xu Yang'), arxiv.Result.Author('Michael C.

14,Gaze-Vergence-Controlled See-Through Vision in Augmented Reality,"Augmented Reality (AR) see-through vision is an interesting research topic
since it enables users to see through a wall and see the occluded objects. Most
existing research focuses on the visual effects of see-through vision, while
the interaction method is less studied. However, we argue that using common
interaction modalities, e.g., midair click and speech, may not be the optimal
way to control see-through vision. This is because when we want to see through
something, it is physically related to our gaze depth/vergence and thus should
be naturally controlled by the eyes. Following this idea, this paper proposes a
novel gaze-vergence-controlled (GVC) see-through vision technique in AR. Since
gaze depth is needed, we build a gaze tracking module with two infrared cameras
and the corresponding algorithm and assemble it into the Microsoft HoloLens 2
to achieve gaze depth estimation. We then propose two different GVC modes for
see-through vision to fit different scenarios. Extensive experimental results
demonstrate that our gaze depth estimation is efficient and accurate. By
comparing with conventional interaction modalities, our GVC techniques are also
shown to be superior in terms of efficiency and more preferred by users.
Finally, we present four example applications of gaze-vergence-controlled
see-through vision.",2207.02645v1,cs.CV,2022-07-06 13:11:34+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Zhimin Wang'), arxiv.Result.Author('Yuxin Zhao'), arxiv.Result.Author('Feng Lu')]",
15,Vlasov Simulation of Emissive Plasma Sheath with Energy-Dependent Secondary Emission Coefficient and Improved Modeling for Dielectric Charging Effects,"A one dimensional Vlasov Poisson simulation code is employed to investigate
the plasma sheath considering electron induced secondary electron emission
(SEE) and backscattering. The SEE coefficient is commonly treated as constant
in a range of plasma simulations, here improved SEE model of a charged
dielectric wall is constructed which includes the wall charging effect on SEE
coefficient and the energy dependency of SEE coefficient. Pertinent algorithms
to implement above SEE model in plasma simulation are studied in detail. It is
found that the SEE coefficient increases with the amount of negative wall
charges, which in turn reduces the emissive sheath potential. With energy
dependent SEE coefficient, the sheath potential is a nonlinear function of the
plasma electron temperature, as opposed to the linear relation predicted by
classic emissive sheath theory. Simulation combining both wall charging effect
and SEE coefficient energy dependency suggests that the space charged limited
sheath is formed at high plasma electron temperature levels, where both sheath
potential and surface charging saturate. Additionally, different algorithms to
implement the backscattering in kinetic simulation are tested and compared.
Converting backscattered electron to secondary electron via an effective SEE
coefficient barely affects the sheath properties. The simulation results are
shown to be commensurate with the upgraded sheath theory predictions.",2209.09567v1,physics.plasm-ph,2022-09-20 09:13:56+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Guang-Yu Sun'), arxiv.Result.Author('Shu Zhang'), arxiv.Result.Author('Bao-Hong Guo'), arxiv.Result.Author('An-Bang Sun'), arxiv.Result.Author('Guan-Jun Zhang')]",

leptons are introduced with the neutral particles of the triplets playing the
role of See-Saw. The triplet leptons have charged partners with standard model
gauge interactions resulting in many new features. The gauge interactions of
these particles make it easier for leptognesis with low masses, as low as a TeV
is possible. The gauge interactions also make the production and detection of
triplet leptons at LHC possible. The See-Saw mechanism and leptogenesis due to
Type III See-Saw may be tested at LHC.",0901.1264v2,hep-ph,2009-01-09 16:14:07+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Shao-Long Chen'), arxiv.Result.Author('Xiao-Gang He')]",

31,Typical duration of good seeing sequences at Concordia,"Context: The winter seeing at Concordia is essentially bimodal, excellent or
quite poor, with relative proportions that depend on altitude above the snow
surface. This paper studies the temporal behavior of the good seeing sequences.
Aims: An efficient exploitation of extremely good seeing with an adaptive
optics system needs long integrations. It is then important to explore the
temporal distribution of the fraction of time providing excellent seeing.
Methods: Temporal windows of good seeing are created by a simple binary
process. Good or bad. Their autocorrelations are corrected for those of the
existing data sets, since these are not continuous, being often interrupted by
technical problems in addition to the adverse weather gaps. At the end these
corrected autocorrelations provide the typical duration of good seeing
sequences. This study has to be a little detailed as its results depend on the
season, summer or winter. Results: Using a threshold of 0.5 arcsec to define
the ""good seeing"", three characteristic numbers are found to describe the
temporal evolution of the good seeing windows. The first number is the mean
duration of an uninterrupted good seeing sequence: it is $\tau_0=7.5$ hours at
8 m above the ground (15 hours at 20 m). These sequences are randomly
distributed in time, with a negative exponential law of damping time
$\tau_1=29$ hours (at elevation 8 m and 20 m). The third number is the mean
time between two 29 hours episodes. It is T=10 days at 8 m high (5 days at 20
m).",1003.3583v1,astro-ph.IM,2010-03-18 14:09:06+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Eric Fossat'), arxiv.Result.Author('Eric Aristidi'), arxiv.Result.Author('Karim Agabi'), arxiv.Result.Author('Erick Bondoux'), arxiv.Result.Author('Zalpha Challita'), arxiv.Result.Author('Francois Jeanneaux'), arxiv.Result.Author('Djamel Mekarnia')]",
32,Excellent daytime seeing at Dome Fuji on the Antarctic plateau,"Context. Dome Fuji, the second highest region on the Antarctic plateau, is
expected to have some of the best astronomical seeing on Earth. However, site
testing at Dome Fuji is still in its very early stages.
  Aims. To investigate the astronomical seeing in the free atmosphere above
Dome Fuji, and to determine the height of the surface boundary layer.
  Methods. A Differential Image Motion Monitor was used to measure the seeing
in the visible (472 nm) at a height of 11 m above the snow surface at Dome Fuji
during the austral summer of 2012/2013.
  Results. Seeing below 0.2'' has been observed. The seeing often has a local
minimum of ~0.3'' near 18 h local time. Some periods of excellent seeing, 0.3''
or smaller, were also observed, sometimes extending for several hours at local
midnight. The median seeing is higher, at 0.52''---this large value is believed
to be caused by periods when the telescope was within the turbulent boundary
layer.
  Conclusions. The diurnal variation of the daytime seeing at Dome Fuji is
similar to that reported for Dome C, and the height of the surface boundary
layer is consistent with previous simulations for Dome Fuji. The free
atmosphere seeing is ~0.2'', and the height of the surface boundary layer can
be as low as ~11 m.",1305.5109v1,astro-ph.IM,2013-05-22 12:38:07+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('H. Okita'), arxiv.Result.Author('T. Ichikawa'), arxiv.Result.Author('M. C. B. Ashley'), arxiv.Result.Author('N. Takato')]",
33,Night-time measurements of astronomical seeing at Dome A in Antarctica,"Seeing, the angular size of stellar images blurred by atmospheric turbulence,
is a critical parameter used to assess the quality of astronomical sites.
Median values at the best mid-latitude sites are generally in the range of
0.6--0.8\,arcsec. Sites on the Antarctic plateau are characterized by
comparatively-weak turbulence in the free-atmosphere above a strong but thin
boundary layer. The median seeing at Dome C is estimated to be 0.23--0.36
arcsec above a boundary layer that has a typical height of 30\,m. At Dome A and
F, the only previous seeing measurements were made during daytime. Here we
report the first direct measurements of night-time seeing at Dome A, using a
Differential Image Motion Monitor. Located at a height of just 8\,m, it
recorded seeing as low as 0.13\,arcsec, and provided seeing statistics that are
comparable to those for a 20\,m height at Dome C. It indicates that the
boundary layer was below 8\,m 31\% of the time. At such times the median seeing
was 0.31\,arcsec, consistent with free-atmosphere seeing. The seeing and
boundary layer thickness are found to be strongly correlated with the
near-surface temperature gradient. The correlation confirms a median thickness
of approximately 14\,m for the boundary layer at Dome A, as found from a sonic
radar. The thinner boundary layer makes it less challenging to locate a
telescope above it, thereby giving greater access to the free-atmosphere.",2007.15365v1,astro-ph.IM,2020-07-30 10:36:24+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Bin Ma'), arxiv.Result.Author('Zhaohui Shang'), arxiv.Result.Author('Yi Hu'), arxiv.Result.Author('Keliang Hu'), arxiv.Result.Author('Yongjiang Wang'), arxiv.Result.Author('Xu Yang'), arxiv.Result.Author('Michael C.

34,Gaze-Vergence-Controlled See-Through Vision in Augmented Reality,"Augmented Reality (AR) see-through vision is an interesting research topic
since it enables users to see through a wall and see the occluded objects. Most
existing research focuses on the visual effects of see-through vision, while
the interaction method is less studied. However, we argue that using common
interaction modalities, e.g., midair click and speech, may not be the optimal
way to control see-through vision. This is because when we want to see through
something, it is physically related to our gaze depth/vergence and thus should
be naturally controlled by the eyes. Following this idea, this paper proposes a
novel gaze-vergence-controlled (GVC) see-through vision technique in AR. Since
gaze depth is needed, we build a gaze tracking module with two infrared cameras
and the corresponding algorithm and assemble it into the Microsoft HoloLens 2
to achieve gaze depth estimation. We then propose two different GVC modes for
see-through vision to fit different scenarios. Extensive experimental results
demonstrate that our gaze depth estimation is efficient and accurate. By
comparing with conventional interaction modalities, our GVC techniques are also
shown to be superior in terms of efficiency and more preferred by users.
Finally, we present four example applications of gaze-vergence-controlled
see-through vision.",2207.02645v1,cs.CV,2022-07-06 13:11:34+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Zhimin Wang'), arxiv.Result.Author('Yuxin Zhao'), arxiv.Result.Author('Feng Lu')]",

the plasma sheath considering electron induced secondary electron emission
(SEE) and backscattering. The SEE coefficient is commonly treated as constant
in a range of plasma simulations, here improved SEE model of a charged
dielectric wall is constructed which includes the wall charging effect on SEE
coefficient and the energy dependency of SEE coefficient. Pertinent algorithms
to implement above SEE model in plasma simulation are studied in detail. It is
found that the SEE coefficient increases with the amount of negative wall
charges, which in turn reduces the emissive sheath potential. With energy
dependent SEE coefficient, the sheath potential is a nonlinear function of the
plasma electron temperature, as opposed to the linear relation predicted by
classic emissive sheath theory. Simulation combining both wall charging effect
and SEE coefficient energy dependency suggests that the space charged limited
sheath is formed at high plasma electron temperature levels, where both sheath
potential and surface charging saturate. Additionally, different algorithms to
implement the backscattering in kinetic simulation are tested and compared.
Converting backscattered electron to secondary electron via an effective SEE
coefficient barely affects the sheath properties. The simulation results are
shown to be commensurate with the upgraded sheath theory predictions.",2209.09567v1,physics.plasm-ph,2022-09-20 09:13:56+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Guang-Yu Sun'), arxiv.Result.Author('Shu Zhang'), arxiv.Result.Author('Bao-Hong Guo'), arxiv.Result.Author('An-Bang Sun'), arxiv.Result.Author('Guan-Jun Zhang')]",

verifiability that use only ""low-tech cryptography"" without using computers to
mark or collect ballots. Specifically, we define the problem, introduce several
building blocks, and propose a new protocol that combines these blocks in novel
ways. Our new building blocks include ""foldable ballots"" that can be rotated to
hide the alignment of ballot choices with voting marks, and ""visual secrets""
that are easy to remember and use but hard to describe. Although closely seated
participants in a boardroom election have limited privacy, the protocol ensures
that no one can determine how others voted. Moreover, each voter can verify
that their ballot was correctly cast, collected, and counted, without being
able to prove how they voted, providing assurance against undue influence.
Low-tech cryptography is useful in situations where constituents do not trust
computer technology, and it avoids the complex auditing requirements of

43,Auditing for Core Stability in Participatory Budgeting,"We consider the participatory budgeting problem where each of $n$ voters
specifies additive utilities over $m$ candidate projects with given sizes, and
the goal is to choose a subset of projects (i.e., a committee) with total size
at most $k$. Participatory budgeting mathematically generalizes multiwinner
elections, and both have received great attention in computational social
choice recently. A well-studied notion of group fairness in this setting is
core stability: Each voter is assigned an ""entitlement"" of $\frac{k}{n}$, so
that a subset $S$ of voters can pay for a committee of size at most $|S| \cdot
\frac{k}{n}$. A given committee is in the core if no subset of voters can pay
for another committee that provides each of them strictly larger utility. This
provides proportional representation to all voters in a strong sense.
  In this paper, we study the following auditing question: Given a committee
computed by some preference aggregation method, how close is it to the core?
Concretely, how much does the entitlement of each voter need to be scaled down
by, so that the core property subsequently holds? As our main contribution, we
present computational hardness results for this problem, as well as a
logarithmic approximation algorithm via linear program rounding. We show that
our analysis is tight against the linear programming bound. Additionally, we
consider two related notions of group fairness that have similar audit
properties. The first is Lindahl priceability, which audits the closeness of a
committee to a market clearing solution. We show that this is related to the
linear programming relaxation of auditing the core, leading to efficient exact
and approximation algorithms for auditing. The second is a novel weakening of
the core that we term the sub-core, and we present computational results for
auditing this notion as well.",2209.14468v1,cs.GT,2022-09-28 23:13:06+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Kamesh Munagala'), arxiv.Result.Author('Yiheng Shen'), arxiv.Result.Author('Kangning Wang')]",

that securely store data using information dispersal and support fast reads. In
such a scenario, given a maximum number~$f$ of faulty storage objects and a
minimum number~$\tau$ of data blocks required to recover a stored value, we
prove that (1) auditability is impossible if $\tau \leq 2f $; (2) implementing

Threshold-encryption, which is used to implement the quorum, prevents a

decrypt each vote. Ballot sheets are encrypted by onion-routing, which has a
layer with the key of the election instance, so it's impossible for a quorum to
decode the results before they have announced their decision by exposing their
keys. A register of voters ensures that only verified voters can vote without
compromising their identity. If there any doubts about the identity of a voter,
their vote can be excluded from the election, if a quorum agrees. This system

48,BVOT: Self-Tallying Boardroom Voting with Oblivious Transfer,"A boardroom election is an election with a small number of voters carried out
with public communications. We present BVOT, a self-tallying boardroom voting
protocol with ballot secrecy, fairness (no tally information is available
before the polls close), and dispute-freeness (voters can observe that all
voters correctly followed the protocol).
  BVOT works by using a multiparty threshold homomorphic encryption system in
which each candidate is associated with a masked unique prime. Each voter
engages in an oblivious transfer with an untrusted distributor: the voter
selects the index of a prime associated with a candidate and receives the
selected prime in masked form. The voter then casts their vote by encrypting
their masked prime and broadcasting it to everyone. The distributor does not
learn the voter's choice, and no one learns the mapping between primes and
candidates until the audit phase. By hiding the mapping between primes and
candidates, BVOT provides voters with insufficient information to carry out
effective cheating. The threshold feature prevents anyone from computing any
partial tally---until everyone has voted. Multiplying all votes, their
decryption shares, and the unmasking factor yields a product of the primes each
raised to the number of votes received.
  In contrast to some existing boardroom voting protocols, BVOT does not rely
on any zero-knowledge proof; instead, it uses oblivious transfer to assure
ballot secrecy and correct vote casting. Also, BVOT can handle multiple
candidates in one election. BVOT prevents cheating by hiding crucial
information: an attempt to increase the tally of one candidate might increase
the tally of another candidate. After all votes are cast, any party can tally
the votes.",2010.02421v1,cs.CR,2020-10-06 01:28:34+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Farid Javani'), arxiv.Result.Author('Alan T. Sherman')]",
49,Risk-Limiting Tallies,"Many voter-verifiable, coercion-resistant schemes have been proposed, but
even the most carefully designed systems necessarily leak information via the
announced result. In corner cases, this may be problematic. For example, if all
the votes go to one candidate then all vote privacy evaporates. The mere
possibility of candidates getting no or few votes could have implications for
security in practice: if a coercer demands that a voter cast a vote for such an
unpopular candidate, then the voter may feel obliged to obey, even if she is
confident that the voting system satisfies the standard coercion resistance
definitions. With complex ballots, there may also be a danger of ""Italian""
style (aka ""signature"") attacks: the coercer demands the voter cast a ballot
with a specific, identifying pattern. Here we propose an approach to tallying
end-to-end verifiable schemes that avoids revealing all the votes but still
achieves whatever confidence level in the announced result is desired. Now a
coerced voter can claim that the required vote must be amongst those that
remained shrouded. Our approach is based on the well-established notion of
Risk-Limiting Audits, but here applied to the tally rather than to the audit.
We show that this approach counters coercion threats arising in extreme tallies

vote trackers are revealed, thereby enhancing the coercion mitigation

result in a trustworthy way that the public can verify. A full manual tally
from the VVPATs could be prohibitively expensive and time-consuming; moreover,
it is difficult for the public to determine whether a full hand count was

is used when multiple candidates need to be elected. The complexity of these
systems has made it difficult to audit the election outcomes. There is
currently no known risk-limiting audit (RLA) method for STV, other than a full
manual count of the ballots.
  A new approach to auditing these systems was recently proposed, based on a
Dirichlet-tree model. We present a detailed analysis of this approach for

for the prior distribution, including some approaches using a Bayesian
bootstrap (equivalent to an improper prior). Our findings include that the
bootstrap-based approaches can be adapted to perform similarly to a full
Bayesian model in practice, and that an overly informative prior can give
counter-intuitive results. Via carefully chosen examples, we show why creating

54,Implementing Risk-Limiting Post-Election Audits in California,"Risk-limiting post-election audits limit the chance of certifying an
electoral outcome if the outcome is not what a full hand count would show.
Building on previous work, we report on pilot risk-limiting audits in four
elections during 2008 in three California counties: one during the February
2008 Primary Election in Marin County and three during the November 2008
General Elections in Marin, Santa Cruz and Yolo Counties. We explain what makes
an audit risk-limiting and how existing and proposed laws fall short. We
discuss the differences among our four pilot audits. We identify challenges to
practical, efficient risk-limiting audits and conclude that current approaches
are too complex to be used routinely on a large scale. One important logistical
bottleneck is the difficulty of exporting data from commercial election
management systems in a format amenable to audit calculations. Finally, we
propose a bare-bones risk-limiting audit that is less efficient than these

55,Learning Sampling in Financial Statement Audits using Vector Quantised Autoencoder Neural Networks,"The audit of financial statements is designed to collect reasonable assurance
that an issued statement is free from material misstatement 'true and fair
presentation'. International audit standards require the assessment of a
statements' underlying accounting relevant transactions referred to as 'journal
entries' to detect potential misstatements. To efficiently audit the increasing
quantities of such entries, auditors regularly conduct a sample-based
assessment referred to as 'audit sampling'. However, the task of audit sampling
is often conducted early in the overall audit process. Often at a stage, in
which an auditor might be unaware of all generative factors and their dynamics
that resulted in the journal entries in-scope of the audit. To overcome this
challenge, we propose the application of Vector Quantised-Variational
Autoencoder (VQ-VAE) neural networks. We demonstrate, based on two real-world
city payment datasets, that such artificial neural networks are capable of
learning a quantised representation of accounting data. We show that the
learned quantisation uncovers (i) the latent factors of variation and (ii) can
be utilised as a highly representative audit sample in financial statement

56,SOBA: Secrecy-preserving Observable Ballot-level Audit,"SOBA is an approach to election verification that provides observers with
justifiably high confidence that the reported results of an election are
consistent with an audit trail (""ballots""), which can be paper or electronic.
SOBA combines three ideas: (1) publishing cast vote records (CVRs) separately
for each contest, so that anyone can verify that each reported contest outcome
is correct, if the CVRs reflect voters' intentions with sufficient accuracy;
(2) shrouding a mapping between ballots and the CVRs for those ballots to
prevent the loss of privacy that could occur otherwise; (3) assessing the
accuracy with which the CVRs reflect voters' intentions for a collection of
contests while simultaneously assessing the integrity of the shrouded mapping
between ballots and CVRs by comparing randomly selected ballots to the CVRs
that purport to represent them. Step (1) is related to work by the Humboldt
County Election Transparency Project, but publishing CVRs separately for
individual contests rather than images of entire ballots preserves privacy.
Step (2) requires a cryptographic commitment from elections officials.
Observers participate in step (3), which relies on the ""super-simple
simultaneous single-ballot risk-limiting audit."" Step (3) is designed to reveal
relatively few ballots if the shrouded mapping is proper and the CVRs
accurately reflect voter intent. But if the reported outcomes of the contests
differ from the outcomes that a full hand count would show, step (3) is
guaranteed to have a large chance of requiring all the ballots to be counted by
hand, thereby limiting the risk that an incorrect outcome will become official

nearest-neighbour interactions. Each voter is endowed with a Boolean variable

resetting by considering stubborn voters. In addition to the usual dynamics,
voters revert independently to their initial opinion according to a Poisson
process of fixed intensity. The resulting kinetic equations for the average
magnetization and two-point function of the model are derived and solved in
closed form. They are formally identical to the heat equation coupled to a
thermostat, whose temperature profile is induced by the initial conditions. In
the case of initial conditions consisting of a single decided voter at the
origin in a environment full of undecided voters, the average magnetization
evolves as the probability density of a random walker with stochastic resetting
to the origin. However, the long-time behaviour of the two-point function
contains terms terms that cannot be obtained from a renewal argument. As a
result, the steady-state density of domain walls can be minimized as a function

59,Continual Learning for Unsupervised Anomaly Detection in Continuous Auditing of Financial Accounting Data,"International audit standards require the direct assessment of a financial
statement's underlying accounting journal entries. Driven by advances in
artificial intelligence, deep-learning inspired audit techniques emerged to
examine vast quantities of journal entry data. However, in regular audits, most
of the proposed methods are applied to learn from a comparably stationary
journal entry population, e.g., of a financial quarter or year. Ignoring
situations where audit relevant distribution changes are not evident in the
training data or become incrementally available over time. In contrast, in
continuous auditing, deep-learning models are continually trained on a stream
of recorded journal entries, e.g., of the last hour. Resulting in situations
where previous knowledge interferes with new information and will be entirely
overwritten. This work proposes a continual anomaly detection framework to
overcome both challenges and designed to learn from a stream of journal entry

this known voter turnout rate, as well as other population marginal
distributions of demographic variables, in multiple imputation for unit and
item nonresponse. In doing so, we ensure that the imputations produce
design-based estimates that are plausible given the known margins. We introduce
and utilize a hybrid missingness model comprising a pattern mixture model for
unit nonresponse and selection models for item nonresponse. Using simulation
studies, we illustrate repeated sampling performance of the model under
different assumptions about the missingness mechanisms. We apply the model to
examine voter turnout by subgroups using the 2018 Current Population Survey for

if they feel sure their candidate will lose anyway (a condition we call
dejectedness). The voters reach these decisions based on a myopic assessment of
their local network, which they take as a proxy for the entire electorate:
voters know which candidate their neighbors prefer and they assume -- perhaps
incorrectly -- that those neighbors will turn out to vote, so they themselves
cast a vote if and only if it would produce a tie or a win for their preferred
candidate in their local neighborhood. We explore various network structures

Since the availability of entertainment content has increased too, the effect

relative preferences for entertainment and information. Access to new media
should increase knowledge and vote likelihood among people who prefer news. At
the same time, it is hypothesized to have a negative effect on knowledge and
turnout for people who prefer entertainment content. Hypotheses are tested by
building a measure of Relative Entertainment Preference (REP) from existing NES

70,"The Efficiency Gap, Voter Turnout, and the Efficiency Principle","Recently, scholars from law and political science have introduced metrics
which use only election outcomes (and not district geometry) to assess the
presence of partisan gerrymandering. The most high-profile example of such a
tool is the efficiency gap. Some scholars have suggested that such tools should
be sensitive enough to alert us when two election outcomes have the same
percentage of votes going to political party $A$, but one of the two awards
party $A$ more seats. When a metric is able to distinguish election outcomes in
this way, that metric is said to satisfy the efficiency principle.
  In this article, we show that the efficiency gap fails to satisfy the
efficiency principle. We show precisely how the efficiency principle breaks
down in the presence of unequal voter turnout. To do this, we first present a
construction that, given any rationals $1/4< V<3/4$ and $0<S<1$, constructs an
election outcome with vote share $V$, seat share $S$, and EG = 0. (For
instance, one party can get 26% of the vote and anywhere from 1% to 99% of the
seats while the efficiency gap remains zero.) Then, for any election with vote
share $1/4<V<3/4$, seat share $S$, and EG= 0, we express the ratio $\rho$ of
average turnout in districts party $A$ lost to average turnout in districts
party $A$ won as a function in only $V$ and $S$. It is well known that when all
districts have equal turnout, EG can be expressed as a simple formula in $V$
and $S$; we express the efficiency gap of any election as an equation only in
$V, S,$ and $\rho$. We also report on the values of $\rho$ that can be observed

the protocol provides candidates no incentive to attempt inducement or coercion

72,Influencing elections with statistics: Targeting voters with logistic regression trees,"In political campaigning substantial resources are spent on voter
mobilization, that is, on identifying and influencing as many people as

at increasing overall turnout using the example of the 2004 US presidential
election. Based on a real data set of 19,634 eligible voters from Ohio, we
introduce a modern statistical framework well suited for carrying out the main
tasks of voter targeting in a single sweep: predicting an individual's turnout
(or support) likelihood for a particular cause, party or candidate as well as
data-driven voter segmentation. Our framework, which we refer to as LORET (for
LOgistic REgression Trees), contains standard methods such as logistic
regression and classification trees as special cases and allows for a synthesis
of both techniques. For our case study, we explore various LORET models with
different regressors in the logistic model components and different
partitioning variables in the tree components; we analyze them in terms of
their predictive accuracy and compare the effect of using the full set of
available variables against using only a limited amount of information. We find
that augmenting a standard set of variables (such as age and voting history)
with additional predictor variables (such as the household composition in terms
of party affiliation) clearly improves predictive accuracy. We also find that
LORET models based on tree induction beat the unpartitioned models.

how contingent allocation of prizes based on relative levels of support affects
equilibrium voting behavior. In addition to standard notions of pivotality,
voters influence the distribution of prizes across groups. Such prize
pivotality supports positive voter turnout even in non-competitive electoral
settings. The analysis shows that competition for a prize awarded to the most
supportive group is only stable when two groups actively support a party.
However, competition among groups to avoid punishment is stable in environments
with any number of groups. We conclude by examining implications for endogenous

shares also exhibit a strong and long-range spatial correlation. Previously, it
was considered difficult to induce strong and long-range spatial correlation of
the vote shares without breaking the empirically observed narrow distribution.
We demonstrate that a voter model on networks shows such a behavior. In the
model, there are many voters in a node who are affected by the agents in the
node and by the agents in the linked nodes. A multivariate Wright-Fisher
diffusion equation for the joint probability density of the vote shares is
derived. The stationary distribution is a multivariate generalization of the
beta distribution. In addition, we also estimate the equilibrium values and the

78,Leveraging Administrative Data for Bias Audits: Assessing Disparate Coverage with Mobility Data for COVID-19 Policy,"Anonymized smartphone-based mobility data has been widely adopted in devising
and evaluating COVID-19 response strategies such as the targeting of public
health resources. Yet little attention has been paid to measurement validity

users are represented as well as the challenge of obtaining ground truth data
on unique visits and demographics. We illustrate how linking large-scale
administrative data can enable auditing mobility data for bias in the absence
of demographic information and ground truth labels. More precisely, we show
that linking voter roll data -- containing individual-level voter turnout for
specific voting locations along with race and age -- can facilitate the
construction of rigorous bias and reliability tests. These tests illuminate a
sampling bias that is particularly noteworthy in the pandemic context: older

justifiably high confidence that the reported results of an election are
consistent with an audit trail (""ballots""), which can be paper or electronic.
SOBA combines three ideas: (1) publishing cast vote records (CVRs) separately
for each contest, so that anyone can verify that each reported contest outcome
is correct, if the CVRs reflect voters' intentions with sufficient accuracy;
(2) shrouding a mapping between ballots and the CVRs for those ballots to
prevent the loss of privacy that could occur otherwise; (3) assessing the
accuracy with which the CVRs reflect voters' intentions for a collection of
contests while simultaneously assessing the integrity of the shrouded mapping
between ballots and CVRs by comparing randomly selected ballots to the CVRs
that purport to represent them. Step (1) is related to work by the Humboldt
County Election Transparency Project, but publishing CVRs separately for
individual contests rather than images of entire ballots preserves privacy.
Step (2) requires a cryptographic commitment from elections officials.
Observers participate in step (3), which relies on the ""super-simple
simultaneous single-ballot risk-limiting audit."" Step (3) is designed to reveal
relatively few ballots if the shrouded mapping is proper and the CVRs
accurately reflect voter intent. But if the reported outcomes of the contests

85,OpenVoting: Making E2E-V voting transparent and recoverable,"End-to-end verifiable (E2E-V) voting systems have been around for some time.
However, their adoption in large elections is poor, seemingly because of the
inaccessibility of their underlying complex cryptography to the general
electorate. Meanwhile, risk-limiting audits based on voter-verified paper
records (VVPR) have been effective in bringing easy-to-understand verifiability
and recoverability to electronic voting, but they generally require the
electorate to trust the post-election custody chain of the paper trail.
  In this paper, we propose \emph{OpenVoting}, a novel polling booth voting
protocol that publicly demonstrates a one-to-one correspondence between the
cryptographically-secured electronic vote records and the easily understandable
paper records, while protecting individual voter secrecy and polling
booth-level voting statistics. This one-to-one correspondence helps each
provide a check for the other, improves overall transparency, and also enables
efficient and principled recovery in case of tally mismatches, by pinpointing
mismatching votes and their associated polling booths. We propose a novel

86,"D-DEMOS: A distributed, end-to-end verifiable, internet voting system","E-voting systems have emerged as a powerful technology for improving
democracy by reducing election cost, increasing voter participation, and even
allowing voters to directly verify the entire election procedure. Prior
internet voting systems have single points of failure, which may result in the
compromise of availability, voter secrecy, or integrity of the election
results. In this paper, we present the design, implementation, security
analysis, and evaluation of D-DEMOS, a complete e-voting system that is
distributed, privacy-preserving and end-to-end verifiable. Our system includes
a fully asynchronous vote collection subsystem that provides immediate
assurance to the voter her vote was recorded as cast, without requiring
cryptographic operations on behalf of the voter. We also include a distributed,
replicated and fault-tolerant Bulletin Board component, that stores all
necessary election-related information, and allows any party to read and verify
the complete election process. Finally, we also incorporate trustees, i.e.,
individuals who control election result production while guaranteeing privacy
and end-to-end-verifiability as long as their strong majority is honest. Our
system is the first e-voting system whose voting operation is human verifiable,
i.e., a voter can vote over the web, even when her web client stack is
potentially unsafe, without sacrificing her privacy, and still be assured her
vote was recorded as cast. Additionally, a voter can outsource election
auditing to third parties, still without sacrificing privacy. Finally, as the
number of auditors increases, the probability of election fraud going
undetected is diminished exponentially. We provide a model and security

87,Non(c)esuch Ballot-Level Risk-Limiting Audits for Precinct-Count Voting Systems,"Risk-limiting audits (RLAs) guarantee a high probability of correcting
incorrect reported outcomes before the outcomes are certified. The most
efficient use ballot-level comparison, comparing the voting system's
interpretation of individual ballot cards sampled at random (cast-vote records,
CVRs) from a trustworthy paper trail to a human interpretation of the same
cards. Such comparisons require the voting system to create and export CVRs in
a way that can be linked to the individual ballots the CVRs purport to
represent. Such links can be created by keeping the ballots in the order in
which they are scanned or by printing a unique serial number on each ballot.
But for precinct-count systems (PCOS), these strategies may compromise vote
anonymity: the order in which ballots are cast may identify the voters who cast
them. Printing a unique pseudo-random number (""cryptographic nonce"") on each
ballot card after the voter last touches it could reduce such privacy risks.
But what if the system does not in fact print a unique number on each ballot or
does not accurately report the numbers it printed? This paper gives two ways to
conduct an RLA so that even if the system does not print a genuine nonce on
each ballot or misreports the nonces it used, the audit's risk limit is not
compromised (however, the anonymity of votes might be compromised). One method
allows untrusted technology to be used to imprint and to retrieve ballot cards.
The method is adaptive: if the technology behaves properly, this protection
does not increase the audit workload. But if the imprinting or retrieval system
misbehaves, the sample size the RLA requires to confirm the reported results
when the results are correct is generally larger than if the imprinting and
retrieval were accurate.",2207.01362v1,cs.CR,2022-07-04 12:35:42+00:00,[arxiv.Result.Author('Philip B. Stark')],

well-studied, but it is largely under-explored for the rising decentralized

DSN as a usable service in a truly decentralized manner, the blockchain comes
in handy -- to record and verify audit trails in forms of proof of storage, and
based on that, to handle fair payments with necessary dispute resolution.
  Leaving the audit trails on the blockchain offers transparency and fairness,
yet it 1) sacrifices privacy, as they may leak information about the data under
audit, and 2) overwhelms on-chain resources, as they may be practically large
in size and expensive to verify. Prior auditing designs in centralized settings
are not directly applicable here. A handful of proposals targeting DSN cannot
satisfactorily address these issues either.

Threshold-encryption, which is used to implement the quorum, prevents a
deadlock from occurring if a minority of candidates or observers tries to
sabotage the election. Candidates and observers can indicate that the election
was free and fair by exposing their keys, which are used by the system to
decrypt each vote. Ballot sheets are encrypted by onion-routing, which has a
layer with the key of the election instance, so it's impossible for a quorum to
decode the results before they have announced their decision by exposing their
keys. A register of voters ensures that only verified voters can vote without
compromising their identity. If there any doubts about the identity of a voter,
their vote can be excluded from the election, if a quorum agrees. This system
is designed to scale from one instance to a distributed system that runs over
an unlimited number of instances, which can be achieved using cloud instances
or smartphones belonging to voters or tellers.",2011.10902v2,cs.CR,2020-11-22 00:58:34+00:00,[arxiv.Result.Author('Kirill A. Korinsky')],

verifiability that use only ""low-tech cryptography"" without using computers to
mark or collect ballots. Specifically, we define the problem, introduce several
building blocks, and propose a new protocol that combines these blocks in novel
ways. Our new building blocks include ""foldable ballots"" that can be rotated to
hide the alignment of ballot choices with voting marks, and ""visual secrets""
that are easy to remember and use but hard to describe. Although closely seated
participants in a boardroom election have limited privacy, the protocol ensures
that no one can determine how others voted. Moreover, each voter can verify
that their ballot was correctly cast, collected, and counted, without being
able to prove how they voted, providing assurance against undue influence.
Low-tech cryptography is useful in situations where constituents do not trust
computer technology, and it avoids the complex auditing requirements of
end-to-end cryptographic voting systems such as Pr\^{e}t-\`{a}-Voter. This

93,Auditing for Core Stability in Participatory Budgeting,"We consider the participatory budgeting problem where each of $n$ voters
specifies additive utilities over $m$ candidate projects with given sizes, and
the goal is to choose a subset of projects (i.e., a committee) with total size
at most $k$. Participatory budgeting mathematically generalizes multiwinner
elections, and both have received great attention in computational social
choice recently. A well-studied notion of group fairness in this setting is
core stability: Each voter is assigned an ""entitlement"" of $\frac{k}{n}$, so
that a subset $S$ of voters can pay for a committee of size at most $|S| \cdot
\frac{k}{n}$. A given committee is in the core if no subset of voters can pay
for another committee that provides each of them strictly larger utility. This
provides proportional representation to all voters in a strong sense.
  In this paper, we study the following auditing question: Given a committee
computed by some preference aggregation method, how close is it to the core?
Concretely, how much does the entitlement of each voter need to be scaled down
by, so that the core property subsequently holds? As our main contribution, we
present computational hardness results for this problem, as well as a
logarithmic approximation algorithm via linear program rounding. We show that
our analysis is tight against the linear programming bound. Additionally, we
consider two related notions of group fairness that have similar audit
properties. The first is Lindahl priceability, which audits the closeness of a
committee to a market clearing solution. We show that this is related to the
linear programming relaxation of auditing the core, leading to efficient exact
and approximation algorithms for auditing. The second is a novel weakening of
the core that we term the sub-core, and we present computational results for
auditing this notion as well.",2209.14468v1,cs.GT,2022-09-28 23:13:06+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Kamesh Munagala'), arxiv.Result.Author('Yiheng Shen'), arxiv.Result.Author('Kangning Wang')]",

even the most carefully designed systems necessarily leak information via the

the votes go to one candidate then all vote privacy evaporates. The mere
possibility of candidates getting no or few votes could have implications for
security in practice: if a coercer demands that a voter cast a vote for such an
unpopular candidate, then the voter may feel obliged to obey, even if she is
confident that the voting system satisfies the standard coercion resistance
definitions. With complex ballots, there may also be a danger of ""Italian""
style (aka ""signature"") attacks: the coercer demands the voter cast a ballot
with a specific, identifying pattern. Here we propose an approach to tallying
end-to-end verifiable schemes that avoids revealing all the votes but still
achieves whatever confidence level in the announced result is desired. Now a
coerced voter can claim that the required vote must be amongst those that
remained shrouded. Our approach is based on the well-established notion of
Risk-Limiting Audits, but here applied to the tally rather than to the audit.
We show that this approach counters coercion threats arising in extreme tallies

up. After the polls close, each voter verifies that this table lists their
(P,V) pair and that the tally is computed correctly. The system is especially
appropriate for any small group making sensitive decisions. Because the system
would not prevent a coercer from demanding that their victim use a specified
passphrase, it is not designed for applications where such malfeasance would be
likely or go undetected. Results from 43 voters show that the system was

Recent studies (e.g., Bernhard, et al. 2020) suggest the verification rate is

of voters being unable to do so accurately or whether this is because voters
simply choose not to attempt verification in the first place. In order to
understand this problem, we conducted an experiment in which 108 participants
participated in a mock election where the BMD displayed the voters' true
choices, but then changed a subset of those choices on the printed ballot. The
design of the printed ballot, the length of the ballot, the number of changes
that were made to the ballot, the location of those changes, and the
instructions provided to the voters were manipulated as part of the experiment.
Results indicated that of those voters who chose to examine the printed ballot,
76% detected anomalies, indicating that voters can reliably detect errors on
their ballot if they will simply review it. This suggests that administrative

corrupt voters or voting authorities. All protocols have polynomial complexity
and require private channels and a simultaneous broadcast channel. Our first
protocol is a basic voting scheme which allows voters to interact in order to
compute the tally. Privacy of the ballot is unconditional, but any voter can
cause the protocol to fail, in which case information about the tally may
nevertheless transpire. Our second protocol introduces voting authorities which
allow the implementation of the first protocol, while reducing the interaction
and limiting it to be only between voters and authorities and among the
authorities themselves. The simultaneous broadcast is also limited to the
authorities. As long as a single authority is honest, the privacy is
unconditional, however, a single corrupt authority or a single corrupt voter
can cause the protocol to fail. Our final protocol provides a safeguard against
corrupt voters by enabling a verification technique to allow the authorities to
revoke incorrect votes. We also discuss the implementation of a simultaneous
broadcast channel with the use of temporary computational assumptions, yielding
versions of our protocols achieving everlasting security.",0806.1931v1,cs.CR,2008-06-11 18:51:04+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Anne Broadbent'), arxiv.Result.Author('Alain Tapp')]",
103,Phrase-Verified Voting: Verifiable Low-Tech Remote Boardroom Voting,"We present Phrase-Verified Voting, a voter-verifiable remote voting system
assembled from commercial off-the-shelf software for small private elections.
The system is transparent and enables each voter to verify that the tally
includes their ballot selection without requiring any understanding of
cryptography. This paper describes the system and its use in fall 2020, to vote
remotely in promotion committees in a university. Each voter fills out a form
in the cloud with their vote V (YES, NO, ABSTAIN) and a passphrase P-two words
entered by the voter. The system generates a verification prompt of the (P,V)
pairs and a tally of the votes, organized to help visualize how the votes add
up. After the polls close, each voter verifies that this table lists their
(P,V) pair and that the tally is computed correctly. The system is especially
appropriate for any small group making sensitive decisions. Because the system
would not prevent a coercer from demanding that their victim use a specified
passphrase, it is not designed for applications where such malfeasance would be
likely or go undetected. Results from 43 voters show that the system was
well-accepted, performed effectively for its intended purpose, and introduced
users to the concept of voter-verified elections. Compared to the commonly-used
alternatives of paper ballots or voting by email, voters found the system
easier to use, and that it provided greater privacy and outcome integrity.",2103.07180v1,cs.CR,2021-03-12 09:59:55+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Enka Blanchard'), arxiv.Result.Author('Ryan Robucci'), arxiv.Result.Author('Ted Selker'), arxiv.Result.Author('Alan Sherman')]",
104,Estonian Voting Verification Mechanism Revisited,"After the Estonian Parliamentary Elections held in 2011, an additional
verification mechanism was integrated into the i-voting system in order to
resist corrupted voting devices, including the so called Student's Attack where
a student practically showed that the voting system is indeed not verifiable by
developing several versions of malware capable of blocking or even changing the
vote. This mechanism gives voters the opportunity to verify whether the vote
they cast is stored in the central system correctly. However, the verification
phase ends by displaying the cast vote in plain form on the verification
device. In other words, the device on which the verification is done learns the
voter's choice. In this work, our aim is to investigate this verification phase
in detail and to point out that leaking the voter's choice to the verification
application may harm the voter privacy. Additionally, when applied in a wide
range, this would even compromise the fairness and the overall secrecy of the
elections. In this respect, we propose an alternative verification mechanism
for the Estonian i-voting system to overcome this vulnerability. Not only is
the proposed mechanism secure and resistant against corrupted verification
devices, so does it successfully verify whether the vote is correctly stored in
the system. We also highlight that our proposed mechanism brings only symmetric
encryptions and hash functions on the verification device, thereby mitigating
these weaknesses in an efficient way with a negligible cost. More concretely,
it brings only $m$ additional symmetric key decryptions to the verification
device, where $m$ denoting the number of candidates. Finally, we prove the
security of the proposed verification mechanism and compare the cost complexity
of the proposed method with that of the current mechanism.",1612.00668v2,cs.CR,2016-12-02 13:08:16+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('K\x7foksal Mus'), arxiv.Result.Author('Mehmet Sabir Kiraz'), arxiv.Result.Author('Murat Cenk'), arxiv.Result.Author('Isa Sertkaya')]",

108,Dispute Resolution in Voting,"In voting, disputes arise when a voter claims that the voting authority is
dishonest and did not correctly process his ballot while the authority claims
to have followed the protocol. A dispute can be resolved if any third party can
unambiguously determine who is right. We systematically characterize all
relevant disputes for a generic, practically relevant, class of voting
protocols. Based on our characterization, we propose a new definition of
dispute resolution for voting that accounts for the possibility that both
voters and the voting authority can make false claims and that voters may
abstain from voting.
  A central aspect of our work is timeliness: a voter should possess the
evidence required to resolve disputes no later than the election's end. We
characterize what assumptions are necessary and sufficient for timeliness in
terms of a communication topology for our voting protocol class. We formalize
the dispute resolution properties and communication topologies symbolically.
This provides the basis for verification of dispute resolution for a broad
class of protocols. To demonstrate the utility of our model, we analyze a
mixnet-based voting protocol and prove that it satisfies dispute resolution as
well as verifiability and receipt-freeness. To prove our claims, we combine
machine-checked proofs with traditional pen-and-paper proofs.",2005.03749v2,cs.CR,2020-05-07 20:51:24+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('David Basin'), arxiv.Result.Author('Sasa Radomirovic'), arxiv.Result.Author('Lara Schmid')]",

about extending the protections of end-to-end verifiable (E2E-V) election
schemes to vote-by-mail contexts. The first - and to date, only - framework to
focus on this setting is STROBE, which has important usability limitations. In
this work, we present two approaches, RemoteVote and SAFE Vote, that allow
mail-in voters to benefit from E2E-V without changing the voter experience for
those who choose not to participate in verification. To evaluate these systems
and compare them with STROBE, we consider an expansive set of properties,

110,Risk-Limiting Tallies,"Many voter-verifiable, coercion-resistant schemes have been proposed, but
even the most carefully designed systems necessarily leak information via the
announced result. In corner cases, this may be problematic. For example, if all
the votes go to one candidate then all vote privacy evaporates. The mere
possibility of candidates getting no or few votes could have implications for
security in practice: if a coercer demands that a voter cast a vote for such an
unpopular candidate, then the voter may feel obliged to obey, even if she is
confident that the voting system satisfies the standard coercion resistance
definitions. With complex ballots, there may also be a danger of ""Italian""
style (aka ""signature"") attacks: the coercer demands the voter cast a ballot
with a specific, identifying pattern. Here we propose an approach to tallying
end-to-end verifiable schemes that avoids revealing all the votes but still
achieves whatever confidence level in the announced result is desired. Now a
coerced voter can claim that the required vote must be amongst those that
remained shrouded. Our approach is based on the well-established notion of
Risk-Limiting Audits, but here applied to the tally rather than to the audit.
We show that this approach counters coercion threats arising in extreme tallies
and ""Italian"" attacks. We illustrate our approach by applying it to the Selene
scheme, and we extend the approach to Risk-Limiting Verification, where not all
vote trackers are revealed, thereby enhancing the coercion mitigation
properties of Selene.",1908.04947v1,cs.CR,2019-08-14 04:23:10+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Wojciech Jamroga'), arxiv.Result.Author('Peter B. Roenne'), arxiv.Result.Author('Peter Y. A. Ryan'), arxiv.Result.Author('Philip B. Stark')]",

regardless of the behavior of the dishonest participants nothing can be learned

Unfortunately, a single dishonest participant can make the protocol abort, in
which case the dishonest participants can nevertheless learn the outcome of the
tally. Our second protocol introduces voting authorities which improves the
communication complexity by limiting interaction to be only between voters and
authorities and among the authorities themselves; the simultaneous broadcast is
also limited to the authorities. In the second protocol, as long as a single
authority is honest, the privacy is unconditional, however, a single corrupt
authority or a single corrupt voter can cause the protocol to abort. Our final
protocol provides a safeguard against corrupt voters by enabling a verification
technique to allow the authorities to revoke incorrect votes without aborting

112,A Novel Hybrid Biometric Electronic Voting System: Integrating Finger Print and Face Recognition,"A novel hybrid design based electronic voting system is proposed, implemented
and analyzed. The proposed system uses two voter verification techniques to
give better results in comparison to single identification based systems.
Finger print and facial recognition based methods are used for voter
identification. Cross verification of a voter during an election process
provides better accuracy than single parameter identification method. The
facial recognition system uses Viola-Jones algorithm along with rectangular
Haar feature selection method for detection and extraction of features to
develop a biometric template and for feature extraction during the voting
process. Cascaded machine learning based classifiers are used for comparing the
features for identity verification using GPCA (Generalized Principle Component
Analysis) and K-NN (K-Nearest Neighbor). It is accomplished through comparing
the Eigen-vectors of the extracted features with the biometric template
pre-stored in the election regulatory body database. The results of the
proposed system show that the proposed cascaded design based system performs
better than the systems using other classifiers or separate schemes i.e. facial
or finger print based schemes. The proposed system will be highly useful for
real time applications due to the reason that it has 91% accuracy under nominal
light in terms of facial recognition. with bags of paper votes. The central
station compiles and publishes the names of winners and losers through
television and radio stations. This method is useful only if the whole process

justifiably high confidence that the reported results of an election are
consistent with an audit trail (""ballots""), which can be paper or electronic.
SOBA combines three ideas: (1) publishing cast vote records (CVRs) separately
for each contest, so that anyone can verify that each reported contest outcome
is correct, if the CVRs reflect voters' intentions with sufficient accuracy;
(2) shrouding a mapping between ballots and the CVRs for those ballots to
prevent the loss of privacy that could occur otherwise; (3) assessing the
accuracy with which the CVRs reflect voters' intentions for a collection of
contests while simultaneously assessing the integrity of the shrouded mapping
between ballots and CVRs by comparing randomly selected ballots to the CVRs
that purport to represent them. Step (1) is related to work by the Humboldt
County Election Transparency Project, but publishing CVRs separately for
individual contests rather than images of entire ballots preserves privacy.
Step (2) requires a cryptographic commitment from elections officials.
Observers participate in step (3), which relies on the ""super-simple
simultaneous single-ballot risk-limiting audit."" Step (3) is designed to reveal
relatively few ballots if the shrouded mapping is proper and the CVRs
accurately reflect voter intent. But if the reported outcomes of the contests
differ from the outcomes that a full hand count would show, step (3) is
guaranteed to have a large chance of requiring all the ballots to be counted by

fact bisimulations of the original model, and therefore satisfy the same

anti-polarization: competing candidates move to the center of the ideological
distribution to maximize vote share, regardless of the underlying ideological
distribution of voters. These anti-polar results, however, largely depend on
the ""singled-peakedness"" of voter preferences, an assumption that is rapidly
loosing relevance in the age of polarization. This article presents a model of
voter choice that examines three potential mechanisms that can undermine this
finding: a relative cost of voting that deters voters who are sufficiently
indifferent to both candidates, ideologically motivated third-party
alternatives that attract extreme voters, and a bimodal distribution of voter
ideology. Under reasonable sets of conditions and empirically observed voter
opinion distributions, these mechanisms can be sufficient to cause

119,A Fault Tolerance Improved Majority Voter for TMR System Architectures,"For digital system designs, triple modular redundancy (TMR), which is a
3-tuple version of N-modular redundancy is widely preferred for many
mission-control and safety-critical applications. The TMR scheme involves
two-times duplication of the simplex system hardware, with a majority voter
ensuring correctness provided at least two out of three copies of the system
remain operational. Thus the majority voter plays a pivotal role in ensuring
the correct operation of the system. The fundamental assumption implicit in the
TMR scheme is that the majority voter does not become faulty, which may not
hold well for implementations based on latest technology nodes with dimensions
of the order of just tens of nanometers. To overcome the drawbacks of the
classical majority voter some new voter designs were put forward in the
literature with the aim of enhancing the fault tolerance. However, these voter
designs generally ensure the correct system operation in the presence of either
a faulty function module or the faulty voter, considered only in isolation.
Since multiple faults may no longer be excluded in the nanoelectronics regime,
simultaneous fault occurrences on both the function module and the voter should
be considered, and the fault tolerance of the voters have to be analyzed under
such a scenario. In this context, this article proposes a new fault-tolerant
majority voter which is found to be more robust to faults than the existing
voters in the presence of faults occurring internally and/or externally to the
voter. Moreover, the proposed voter features less power dissipation, delay, and

125,Effcient logging and querying for Blockchain-based cross-site genomic dataset access audit,"Background: Genomic data have been collected by different institutions and
companies and need to be shared for broader use. In a cross-site genomic data
sharing system, a secure and transparent access control audit module plays an
essential role in ensuring the accountability. The 2018 iDASH competition first
track provides us with an opportunity to design efficient logging and querying
system for cross-site genomic dataset access audit. We designed a
blockchain-based log system which can provide a light-weight and widely
compatible module for existing blockchain platforms. The submitted solution won
the third place of the competition. In this paper, we report the technical
details in our system. Methods: We present two methods: baseline method and
enhanced method. We started with the baseline method and then adjusted our
implementation based on the competition evaluation criteria and characteristics
of the log system. To overcome obstacles of indexing on the immutable
Blockchain system, we designed a hierarchical timestamp structure which
supports efficient range queries on the timestamp field. Results: We
implemented our methods in Python3, tested the scalability, and compared the
performance using the test data supplied by competition organizer. We
successfully boosted the log retrieval speed for complex AND queries that
contain multiple predicates. For the range query, we boosted the speed for at
least one order of magnitude. The storage usage is reduced by 25%. Conclusion:
We demonstrate that Blockchain can be used to build a time and space efficient
log and query genomic dataset audit trail. Therefore, it provides a promising
solution for sharing genomic data with accountability requirement across
multiple sites.",1907.07303v2,cs.DB,2019-07-17 02:11:53+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Shuaicheng Ma'), arxiv.Result.Author('Yang Cao'), arxiv.Result.Author('Li Xiong')]",

130,"Algorithmic audits of algorithms, and the law","Algorithmic decision making is now widespread, ranging from health care
allocation to more common actions such as recommendation or information
ranking. The aim to audit these algorithms has grown alongside. In this paper,
we focus on external audits that are conducted by interacting with the user
side of the target algorithm, hence considered as a black box. Yet, the legal
framework in which these audits take place is mostly ambiguous to researchers
developing them: on the one hand, the legal value of the audit outcome is
uncertain; on the other hand the auditors' rights and obligations are unclear.
The contribution of this paper is to articulate two canonical audit forms to
law, to shed light on these aspects: 1) the first audit form (we coin the Bobby
audit form) checks a predicate against the algorithm, while the second
(Sherlock) is more loose and opens up to multiple investigations. We find that:
Bobby audits are more amenable to prosecution, yet are delicate as operating on
real user data. This can lead to reject by a court (notion of admissibility).
Sherlock audits craft data for their operation, most notably to build
surrogates of the audited algorithm. It is mostly used for acts for
whistleblowing, as even if accepted as a proof, the evidential value will be
low in practice. 2) these two forms require the prior respect of a proper right
to audit, granted by law or by the platform being audited; otherwise the
auditor will be also prone to prosecutions regardless of the audit outcome.
This article thus highlights the relation of current audits with law, in order
to structure the growing field of algorithm auditing.",2203.03711v1,cs.CY,2022-02-15 14:20:53+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Erwan Le Merrer'), arxiv.Result.Author('Ronan Pons'), arxiv.Result.Author('Gilles Tr√©dan')]",

  Smart contracts have emerged in recent years and appear promising for
applications such as legal contracts where transparency is critical and of

contracts execute operations on the blockchain, a distributed public ledger.
  In this paper, we propose the Minimum Hybrid Contract (MHC), with the aim of

contract's financial transactions. The MHC comprises an online smart contract
and an offline traditional legal contract. where the two are immutably linked.

132,Towards Privacy-assured and Lightweight On-chain Auditing of Decentralized Storage,"How to audit outsourced data in centralized storage like cloud is
well-studied, but it is largely under-explored for the rising decentralized
storage network (DSN) that bodes well for a billion-dollar market. To realize
DSN as a usable service in a truly decentralized manner, the blockchain comes
in handy -- to record and verify audit trails in forms of proof of storage, and
based on that, to handle fair payments with necessary dispute resolution.
  Leaving the audit trails on the blockchain offers transparency and fairness,
yet it 1) sacrifices privacy, as they may leak information about the data under
audit, and 2) overwhelms on-chain resources, as they may be practically large
in size and expensive to verify. Prior auditing designs in centralized settings
are not directly applicable here. A handful of proposals targeting DSN cannot
satisfactorily address these issues either.
  We present an auditing solution that addresses on-chain privacy and
efficiency, from a synergy of homomorphic linear authenticators with polynomial
commitments for succinct proofs, and the sigma protocol for provable privacy.

(2) shrouding a mapping between ballots and the CVRs for those ballots to

136,Auditable Restoration of Distributed Programs,"We focus on a protocol for auditable restoration of distributed systems. The
need for such protocol arises due to conflicting requirements (e.g., access to
the system should be restricted but emergency access should be provided). One
can design such systems with a tamper detection approach (based on the
intuition of ""break the glass door""). However, in a distributed system, such
tampering, which are denoted as auditable events, is visible only for a single
node. This is unacceptable since the actions they take in these situations can
be different than those in the normal mode. Moreover, eventually, the auditable
event needs to be cleared so that system resumes the normal operation.
  With this motivation, in this paper, we present a protocol for auditable
restoration, where any process can potentially identify an auditable event.
Whenever a new auditable event occurs, the system must reach an ""auditable
state"" where every process is aware of the auditable event. Only after the
system reaches an auditable state, it can begin the operation of restoration.
Although any process can observe an auditable event, we require that only
""authorized"" processes can begin the task of restoration. Moreover, these
processes can begin the restoration only when the system is in an auditable
state. Our protocol is self-stabilizing and has bounded state space. It can
effectively handle the case where faults or auditable events occur during the
restoration protocol. Moreover, it can be used to provide auditable restoration
to other distributed protocol.",1506.07957v1,cs.DC,2015-06-26 04:52:24+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Reza Hajisheykhi'), arxiv.Result.Author('Mohammad Roohitavaf'), arxiv.Result.Author('Sandeep Kulkarni')]",
137,Non(c)esuch Ballot-Level Risk-Limiting Audits for Precinct-Count Voting Systems,"Risk-limiting audits (RLAs) guarantee a high probability of correcting
incorrect reported outcomes before the outcomes are certified. The most
efficient use ballot-level comparison, comparing the voting system's
interpretation of individual ballot cards sampled at random (cast-vote records,
CVRs) from a trustworthy paper trail to a human interpretation of the same
cards. Such comparisons require the voting system to create and export CVRs in
a way that can be linked to the individual ballots the CVRs purport to
represent. Such links can be created by keeping the ballots in the order in
which they are scanned or by printing a unique serial number on each ballot.
But for precinct-count systems (PCOS), these strategies may compromise vote
anonymity: the order in which ballots are cast may identify the voters who cast
them. Printing a unique pseudo-random number (""cryptographic nonce"") on each
ballot card after the voter last touches it could reduce such privacy risks.
But what if the system does not in fact print a unique number on each ballot or
does not accurately report the numbers it printed? This paper gives two ways to
conduct an RLA so that even if the system does not print a genuine nonce on
each ballot or misreports the nonces it used, the audit's risk limit is not
compromised (however, the anonymity of votes might be compromised). One method
allows untrusted technology to be used to imprint and to retrieve ballot cards.
The method is adaptive: if the technology behaves properly, this protection
does not increase the audit workload. But if the imprinting or retrieval system
misbehaves, the sample size the RLA requires to confirm the reported results
when the results are correct is generally larger than if the imprinting and
retrieval were accurate.",2207.01362v1,cs.CR,2022-07-04 12:35:42+00:00,[arxiv.Result.Author('Philip B. Stark')],

voters can be near-perfect detectors of ballot changes on printed paper ballots

traditional plurality voting in which voters submit rankings over the

influence the outcome of an election, given fixed voter preferences. We show
that there exist preference profiles over $k$ candidates such that up to $k-1$
different candidates win at different ballot lengths. We derive exact lower
bounds on the number of voters required for such profiles and provide a
construction matching the lower bound for unrestricted voter preferences.
Additionally, we characterize which sequences of winners are possible over
ballot lengths and provide explicit profile constructions achieving any
feasible winner sequence. We also examine how classic preference restrictions
influence our results--for instance, single-peakedness makes $k-1$ different
winners impossible but still allows at least $\Omega(\sqrt k)$. Finally, we
analyze a collection of 168 real-world elections, where we truncate rankings to
simulate shorter ballots. We find that shorter ballots could have changed the
outcome in one quarter of these elections. Our results highlight ballot length

voter's actual intent, with the hope that voters would be unlikely to detect
this subterfuge. This essay considers how an election administrator can create
reasonable auditing procedures to gain confidence that their fleet of BMDs is

accessibility features of BMDs while the overall election still benefits from
the same security and reliability properties we expect from hand-marked paper

151,Non(c)esuch Ballot-Level Risk-Limiting Audits for Precinct-Count Voting Systems,"Risk-limiting audits (RLAs) guarantee a high probability of correcting
incorrect reported outcomes before the outcomes are certified. The most
efficient use ballot-level comparison, comparing the voting system's
interpretation of individual ballot cards sampled at random (cast-vote records,
CVRs) from a trustworthy paper trail to a human interpretation of the same
cards. Such comparisons require the voting system to create and export CVRs in
a way that can be linked to the individual ballots the CVRs purport to
represent. Such links can be created by keeping the ballots in the order in
which they are scanned or by printing a unique serial number on each ballot.
But for precinct-count systems (PCOS), these strategies may compromise vote
anonymity: the order in which ballots are cast may identify the voters who cast
them. Printing a unique pseudo-random number (""cryptographic nonce"") on each
ballot card after the voter last touches it could reduce such privacy risks.
But what if the system does not in fact print a unique number on each ballot or
does not accurately report the numbers it printed? This paper gives two ways to
conduct an RLA so that even if the system does not print a genuine nonce on
each ballot or misreports the nonces it used, the audit's risk limit is not
compromised (however, the anonymity of votes might be compromised). One method
allows untrusted technology to be used to imprint and to retrieve ballot cards.
The method is adaptive: if the technology behaves properly, this protection
does not increase the audit workload. But if the imprinting or retrieval system
misbehaves, the sample size the RLA requires to confirm the reported results
when the results are correct is generally larger than if the imprinting and
retrieval were accurate.",2207.01362v1,cs.CR,2022-07-04 12:35:42+00:00,[arxiv.Result.Author('Philip B. Stark')],
152,Adaptive Risk-Limiting Ballot Comparison Audits,"Risk-limiting audits (RLAs) are rigorous statistical procedures meant to
detect invalid election results. RLAs examine paper ballots cast during the
election to statistically assess the possibility of a disagreement between the
winner determined by the ballots and the winner reported by tabulation. The
most ballot efficient approaches proceed by ""ballot comparison."" However,
ballot comparison requires an untrusted declaration of the contents of each
cast ballot, rather than a simple tabulation of vote totals. This ""cast-vote
record table"" (CVR) is then spot-checked against ballots for consistency. In
many practical settings, the cost of generating a suitable CVR dominates the
cost of conducting the audit, preventing widespread adoption of these
sample-efficient techniques.
  We introduce a new RLA procedure: an ""adaptive ballot comparison"" audit. In
this audit, a global CVR is never produced; instead, a three-stage procedure is
iterated:
  1) a batch is selected,
  2) a CVR is produced for that batch, and
  3) a ballot within the batch is sampled, inspected by auditors, and compared
with the CVR.
  We prove that such an audit can achieve risk commensurate with standard
comparison audits while generating a fraction of the CVR. We present three main
contributions:
  1) a formal adversarial model for RLAs;
  2) definition and analysis of an adaptive audit procedure with rigorous risk
limits and an associated correctness analysis accounting for the incidental
errors arising in typical audits; and
  3) an analysis of practical efficiency.
  This method can be organized in rounds (as is typical for comparison audits)
where sampled CVRs are produced in parallel. Using data from Florida's 2020
presidential election with 5% risk and 1% margin, only 22% of the CVR is
generated; at 10% margin, only 2% is generated.",2202.02607v5,cs.CR,2022-02-05 18:04:27+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Benjamin Fuller'), arxiv.Result.Author('Abigail Harrison'), arxiv.Result.Author('Alexander Russell')]",
153,On the Significance of Consecutive Ballots in Paxos,"In this paper we examine the Paxos protocol and demonstrate how the discrete
numbering of ballots can be leveraged to weaken the conditions for learning.
Specifically, we define the notion of consecutive ballots and use this to
define Consecutive Quorums. Consecutive Quorums weakens the learning criterion
such that a learner does not need matching $accept$ messages sent in the $same
\; ballot$ from a majority of acceptors to learn a value. We prove that this
modification preserves the original safety and liveness guarantees of Paxos. We
define $Consecutive \; Paxos$ which encapsulates the properties of discrete
consecutive ballots. To establish the correctness of these results, we, in
addition to a paper proof, formally verify the correctness of a State Machine
Replication Library built on top of an optimized version of Multi-Paxos

154,Identifying Possible Winners in Ranked Choice Voting Elections with Outstanding Ballots,"Several election districts in the US have recently moved to ranked-choice
voting (RCV) to decide the results of local elections. RCV allows voters to
rank their choices, and the results are computed in rounds, eliminating one
candidate at a time. RCV ensures fairer elections and has been shown to
increase elected representation of women and people of color. A main drawback
of RCV is that the round-by-round process requires all the ballots to be
tallied before the results of an election can be calculated. With increasingly
large portions of ballots coming from absentee voters, RCV election outcomes
are not always apparent on election night, and can take several weeks to be
published, leading to a loss of trust in the electoral process from the public.
In this paper, we present an algorithm for efficiently computing possible
winners of RCV elections from partially known ballots and evaluate it on data
from the recent New York City Primary elections. We show that our techniques
allow to significantly narrow down the field of possible election winners, and
in some case identify the winner as soon as election night despite a number of
yet-unaccounted absentee ballots, providing more transparency in the electoral
process.",2206.12741v1,cs.CY,2022-06-25 22:08:15+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Alborz Jelvani'), arxiv.Result.Author('Am√©lie Marian')]",
155,Risk-Limiting Audits by Stratified Union-Intersection Tests of Elections (SUITE),"Risk-limiting audits (RLAs) offer a statistical guarantee: if a full manual
tally of the paper ballots would show that the reported election outcome is
wrong, an RLA has a known minimum chance of leading to a full manual tally.
RLAs generally rely on random samples. Stratified sampling--partitioning the
population of ballots into disjoint strata and sampling independently from the
strata--may simplify logistics or increase efficiency compared to simpler
sampling designs, but makes risk calculations harder. We present SUITE, a new
method for conducting RLAs using stratified samples. SUITE considers all
possible partitions of outcome-changing error across strata. For each
partition, it combines P-values from stratum-level tests into a combined
P-value; there is no restriction on the tests used in different strata. SUITE
maximizes the combined P-value over all partitions of outcome-changing error.
The audit can stop if that maximum is less than the risk limit. Voting systems
in some Colorado counties (comprising 98.2% of voters) allow auditors to check
how the system interpreted each ballot, which allows ballot-level comparison
RLAs. Other counties use ballot polling, which is less efficient. Extant
approaches to conducting an RLA of a statewide contest would require major
changes to Colorado's procedures and software, or would sacrifice the
efficiency of ballot-level comparison. SUITE does not. It divides ballots into
two strata: those cast in counties that can conduct ballot-level comparisons,
and the rest. Stratum-level P-values are found by methods derived here. The
resulting audit is substantially more efficient than statewide ballot polling.
SUITE is useful in any state with a mix of voting systems or that uses
stratified sampling for other reasons. We provide an open-source reference
implementation and exemplar calculations in Jupyter notebooks.",1809.04235v1,stat.AP,2018-09-12 02:56:22+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Kellie Ottoboni'), arxiv.Result.Author('Philip B. Stark'), arxiv.Result.Author('Mark Lindeman'), arxiv.Result.Author('Neal McBurnett')]",

boardroom -- in which all voters can see and hear each other. We present an
initial exploration of boardroom elections with ballot privacy and voter
verifiability that use only ""low-tech cryptography"" without using computers to
mark or collect ballots. Specifically, we define the problem, introduce several
building blocks, and propose a new protocol that combines these blocks in novel
ways. Our new building blocks include ""foldable ballots"" that can be rotated to
hide the alignment of ballot choices with voting marks, and ""visual secrets""
that are easy to remember and use but hard to describe. Although closely seated
participants in a boardroom election have limited privacy, the protocol ensures
that no one can determine how others voted. Moreover, each voter can verify
that their ballot was correctly cast, collected, and counted, without being
able to prove how they voted, providing assurance against undue influence.
Low-tech cryptography is useful in situations where constituents do not trust
computer technology, and it avoids the complex auditing requirements of
end-to-end cryptographic voting systems such as Pr\^{e}t-\`{a}-Voter. This
paper's building blocks and protocol are meant to be a proof of concept that

assume that schema matching and data exchange have been done to convert records
under different schemas to those under a predefined schema. However, we observe
that schema matching would lose information in some cases, which could be
useful or even crucial to ER.
  To leverage sufficient information from heterogeneous sources, in this paper,
we address several challenges of ER on heterogeneous records and show that none
of existing similarity metrics or their transformations could be applied to
find similar records under heterogeneous settings. Motivated by this, we design
the similarity function and propose a novel framework to iteratively find

166,Feasibility Study on Intra-Grid Location Estimation Using Power ENF Signals,"The Electric Network Frequency (ENF) is a signature of power distribution
networks that can be captured by multimedia recordings made in areas where
there is electrical activity. This has led to an emergence of several forensic
applications based on the use of the ENF signature. Examples of such
applications include estimating or verifying the time-of-recording of a media
signal and inferring the power grid associated with the location in which the
media signal was recorded. In this paper, we carry out a feasibility study to
examine the possibility of using embedded ENF traces to pinpoint the
location-of-recording of a signal within a power grid. In this study, we
demonstrate that it is possible to pinpoint the location-of-recording to a
certain geographical resolution using power signal recordings containing strong
ENF traces. To this purpose, a high-passed version of an ENF signal is
extracted and it is demonstrated that the correlation between two such signals,
extracted from recordings made in different geographical locations within the
same grid, decreases as the distance between the recording locations increases.
We harness this property of correlation in the ENF signals to propose
trilateration based localization methods, which pinpoint the unknown location
of a recording while using some known recording locations as anchor locations.
We also discuss the challenges that need to be overcome in order to extend this
work to using ENF traces in noisier audio/video recordings for such fine

167,Application of Advanced Record Linkage Techniques for Complex Population Reconstruction,"Record linkage is the process of identifying records that refer to the same
entities from several databases. This process is challenging because commonly
no unique entity identifiers are available. Linkage therefore has to rely on
partially identifying attributes, such as names and addresses of people. Recent
years have seen the development of novel techniques for linking data from
diverse application areas, where a major focus has been on linking complex data
that contain records about different types of entities. Advanced approaches
that exploit both the similarities between record attributes as well as the
relationships between entities to identify clusters of matching records have
been developed.
  In this application paper we study the novel problem where rather than
different types of entities we have databases where the same entity can have
different roles, and where these roles change over time. We specifically
develop novel techniques for linking historical birth, death, marriage and
census records with the aim to reconstruct the population covered by these
records over a period of several decades. Our experimental evaluation on real
Scottish data shows that even with advanced linkage techniques that consider

168,Increasing Transparent and Accountable Use of Data by Quantifying the Actual Privacy Risk in Interactive Record Linkage,"Record linkage refers to the task of integrating data from two or more

tradeoff between utility and privacy in interactive record linkage. Due to the
need to access personally identifiable information (PII) to accurately assess
whether different records refer to the same person in heterogeneous databases,
privacy is a major concern in interactive record linkage. MINDFIRL supports
interactive record linkage while minimizing the privacy risk by (1) using
pseudonyms to separate the identifying information from the sensitive
information, (2) dynamically disclosing only the minimum necessary information
incrementally, as needed on-demand at the point of decision, and (3) quantifies
the risk due to the needed information disclosure to support transparency, the
reasoning, communication, and decisions on the privacy and utility trade off.
In this paper we present an overview of the MINDFIRL system and the

endpoint is finite and is an atom of the common cumulative distribution
function. The only asymptotic study left to us concerns the infinite sequence
of hitting times of that upper endpoints, which by the way, is the sequence of

170,On the records,"World record setting has long attracted public interest and scientific
investigation. Extremal records summarize the limits of the space explored by a
process, and the historical progression of a record sheds light on the
underlying dynamics of the process. Existing analyses of prediction,
statistical properties, and ultimate limits of record progressions have focused
on particular domains. However, a broad perspective on how record progressions
vary across different spheres of activity needs further development. Here we
employ cross-cutting metrics to compare records across a variety of domains,
including sports, games, biological evolution, and technological development.
We find that these domains exhibit characteristic statistical signatures in
terms of rates of improvement, ""burstiness"" of record-breaking time series, and
the acceleration of the record breaking process. Specifically, sports and games
exhibit the slowest rate of improvement and a wide range of rates of
""burstiness."" Technology improves at a much faster rate and, unlike other
domains, tends to show acceleration in records. Many biological and
technological processes are characterized by constant rates of improvement,
showing less burstiness than sports and games. It is important to understand
how these statistical properties of record progression emerge from the
underlying dynamics. Towards this end, we conduct a detailed analysis of a
particular record-setting event: elite marathon running. In this domain, we
find that studying record-setting data alone can obscure many of the structural
properties of the underlying process. The marathon study also illustrates how

information to obtain fusion features. From a model perspective, our model uses
an end-to-end framework to learn the deep representation from spatial feature

The objective of this research was to study the automatic generation of
high-quality speech from such low-quality device-recorded speech, which could
then be applied to many speech-generation tasks. In this paper, we first
introduce our new device-recorded speech dataset then propose an improved
end-to-end method for automatically transforming the low-quality
device-recorded speech into professional high-quality speech. Our method is an
extension of a generative adversarial network (GAN)-based speech enhancement
model called speech enhancement GAN (SEGAN), and we present two modifications
to make model training more robust and stable. Finally, from a large-scale
listening test, we show that our method can significantly enhance the quality

176,Durable Top-K Instant-Stamped Temporal Records with User-Specified Scoring Functions,"A way of finding interesting or exceptional records from instant-stamped
temporal data is to consider their ""durability,"" or, intuitively speaking, how
well they compare with other records that arrived earlier or later, and how
long they retain their supremacy. For example, people are naturally fascinated
by claims with long durability, such as: ""On January 22, 2006, Kobe Bryant
dropped 81 points against Toronto Raptors. Since then, this scoring record has
yet to be broken."" In general, given a sequence of instant-stamped records,
suppose that we can rank them by a user-specified scoring function $f$, which
may consider multiple attributes of a record to compute a single score for
ranking. This paper studies ""durable top-$k$ queries"", which find records whose
scores were within top-$k$ among those records within a ""durability window"" of
given length, e.g., a 10-year window starting/ending at the timestamp of the
record. The parameter $k$, the length of the durability window, and parameters
of the scoring function (which capture user preference) can all be given at the
query time. We illustrate why this problem formulation yields more meaningful
answers in some practical situations than other similar types of queries
considered previously. We propose new algorithms for solving this problem, and
provide a comprehensive theoretical analysis on the complexities of the problem
itself and of our algorithms. Our algorithms vastly outperform various
baselines (by up to two orders of magnitude on real and synthetic datasets).",2102.12072v2,cs.DB,2021-02-24 05:06:15+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Junyang Gao'), arxiv.Result.Author('Stavros Sintos'), arxiv.Result.Author('Pankaj K. Agarwal'), arxiv.Result.Author('Jun Yang')]",

coercion and vote buying. While coercion-resistant voting systems address this
challenge, current schemes assume that the voter has access to an untappable,
incorruptible device during voter registration. We present TRIP, an in-person
voter registration scheme enabling voters to create verifiable and
indistinguishable real and fake credentials using an untrusted kiosk inside a
privacy booth at a supervised location, e.g., the registrar's office. TRIP
ensures the integrity of the voter's real credential while enabling the
creation of fake credentials using interactive zero-knowledge proofs between
the voter as the verifier and the kiosk as the prover, unbeknownst to the
average voter. TRIP ensures that even voters who are under extreme coercion,
and cannot leave the booth with a real credential, can delegate their vote to a
political party, with the caveat that they must then trust the kiosk. TRIP
optimizes the tallying process by limiting the number of credentials a voter
can receive and capping the number of votes that a credential can cast per
election. We conduct a preliminary usability study among 41 participants at a
university and found that 42.5% of participants rated TRIP a B or higher in
usability, a promising result for a voter registration scheme that
substantially reduces trust in the registrar.",2202.06692v1,cs.CR,2022-02-14 13:35:46+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Louis-Henri Merino'), arxiv.Result.Author('Simone Colombo'), arxiv.Result.Author('Jeff Allen'), arxiv.Result.Author('Vero Estrada-Gali√±anes'), arxiv.Result.Author('Bryan Ford')]",

183,Data-centric Misbehavior Detection in VANETs,"Detecting misbehavior (such as transmissions of false information) in
vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs) is very important problem with wide range of
implications including safety related and congestion avoidance applications. We
discuss several limitations of existing misbehavior detection schemes (MDS)
designed for VANETs. Most MDS are concerned with detection of malicious nodes.
In most situations, vehicles would send wrong information because of selfish
reasons of their owners, e.g. for gaining access to a particular lane. Because
of this (\emph{rational behavior}), it is more important to detect false
information than to identify misbehaving nodes. We introduce the concept of
data-centric misbehavior detection and propose algorithms which detect false
alert messages and misbehaving nodes by observing their actions after sending
out the alert messages. With the data-centric MDS, each node can independently
decide whether an information received is correct or false. The decision is
based on the consistency of recent messages and new alert with reported and
estimated vehicle positions. No voting or majority decisions is needed, making
our MDS resilient to Sybil attacks. Instead of revoking all the secret
credentials of misbehaving nodes, as done in most schemes, we impose fines on
misbehaving nodes (administered by the certification authority), discouraging
them to act selfishly. This reduces the computation and communication costs
involved in revoking all the secret credentials of misbehaving nodes.",1103.2404v1,cs.NI,2011-03-12 00:51:18+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Sushmita Ruj'), arxiv.Result.Author('Marcos Antonio Cavenaghi'), arxiv.Result.Author('Zhen Huang'), arxiv.Result.Author('Amiya Nayak'), arxiv.Result.Author('Ivan Stojmenovic')]",
184,Twins: BFT Systems Made Robust,"This paper presents Twins, an automated unit test generator of Byzantine
attacks. Twins implements three types of Byzantine behaviors: (i) leader
equivocation, (ii) double voting, and (iii) losing internal state such as
forgetting 'locks' guarding voted values. To emulate interesting attacks by a
Byzantine node, it instantiates twin copies of the node instead of one, giving
both twins the same identities and network credentials. To the rest of the
system, the twins appear indistinguishable from a single node behaving in a
'questionable' manner. Twins can systematically generate Byzantine attack
scenarios at scale, execute them in a controlled manner, and examine their
behavior. Twins scenarios iterate over protocol rounds and vary the
communication patterns among nodes. Twins runs in a production setting within
DiemBFT where it can execute 44M Twins-generated scenarios daily. Whereas the
system at hand did not manifest errors, subtle safety bugs that were
deliberately injected for the purpose of validating the implementation of Twins
itself were exposed within minutes. Twins can prevent developers from
regressing correctness when updating the codebase, introducing new features, or
performing routine maintenance tasks. Twins only requires a thin wrapper over
DiemBFT, we thus envision other systems using it. Building on this idea, one
new attack and several known attacks against other BFT protocols were
materialized as Twins scenarios. In all cases, the target protocols break
within fewer than a dozen protocol rounds, hence it is realistic for the Twins

192,Might I Get Pwned: A Second Generation Compromised Credential Checking Service,"Credential stuffing attacks use stolen passwords to log into victim accounts.
To defend against these attacks, recently deployed compromised credential
checking (C3) services provide APIs that help users and companies check whether
a username, password pair is exposed. These services however only check if the
exact password is leaked, and therefore do not mitigate credential tweaking
attacks - attempts to compromise a user account with variants of a user's
leaked passwords. Recent work has shown credential tweaking attacks can
compromise accounts quite effectively even when the credential stuffing
countermeasures are in place. We initiate work on C3 services that protect
users from credential tweaking attacks. The core underlying challenge is how to
identify passwords that are similar to their leaked passwords while preserving
honest clients' privacy and also preventing malicious clients from extracting
breach data from the service. We formalize the problem and explore ways to
measure password similarity that balance efficacy, performance, and security.
Based on this study, we design ""Might I Get Pwned"" (MIGP), a new kind of breach
alerting service. Our simulations show that MIGP reduces the efficacy of
state-of-the-art 1000-guess credential tweaking attacks by 94%. MIGP preserves

identify voting scenarios in which uncertainty about the voting method may

agents since voting is costly. Misbehaving agents always vote. We compare
conventional voting allowing for abstention with vote delegation. Preferences

well-behaving agents win. We illustrate that vote delegation leads to quite
different outcomes than conventional voting with abstention. In particular, we
obtain three insights: First, if the number of misbehaving voters, denoted by f
, is high, both voting methods fail to deliver a positive outcome. Second, if f
takes an intermediate value, conventional voting delivers a positive outcome,
while vote delegation fails with probability one. Third, if f is low,
delegation delivers a positive outcome with higher probability than
conventional voting. Finally, our results characterize worst-case outcomes that

198,Optimal Strategic Mining Against Cryptographic Self-Selection in Proof-of-Stake,"Cryptographic Self-Selection is a subroutine used to select a leader for
modern proof-of-stake consensus protocols, such as Algorand. In cryptographic
self-selection, each round $r$ has a seed $Q_r$. In round $r$, each account
owner is asked to digitally sign $Q_r$, hash their digital signature to produce
a credential, and then broadcast this credential to the entire network. A
publicly-known function scores each credential in a manner so that the
distribution of the lowest scoring credential is identical to the distribution
of stake owned by each account. The user who broadcasts the lowest-scoring
credential is the leader for round $r$, and their credential becomes the seed
$Q_{r+1}$. Such protocols leave open the possibility of a selfish-mining style
attack: a user who owns multiple accounts that each produce low-scoring
credentials in round $r$ can selectively choose which ones to broadcast in
order to influence the seed for round $r+1$. Indeed, the user can pre-compute
their credentials for round $r+1$ for each potential seed, and broadcast only
the credential (among those with a low enough score to be the leader) that
produces the most favorable seed.
  We consider an adversary who wishes to maximize the expected fraction of
rounds in which an account they own is the leader. We show such an adversary
always benefits from deviating from the intended protocol, regardless of the
fraction of the stake controlled. We characterize the optimal strategy; first
by proving the existence of optimal positive recurrent strategies whenever the
adversary owns last than $38\%$ of the stake. Then, we provide a Markov

201,A mathematical evaluation of vote transfer systems,"The paper builds a general model of vote transfer systems on the basis of the
current Hungarian electoral rules. It combines single-seat districts and list
mandates with three possible compensation rule for 'wasted' votes in
constituencies: no compensation (direct vote transfer, DVT), compensation for
votes cast for losing party candidates (positive vote transfer, PVT) and
compensation for all votes that are not necessary to win the district (negative
vote transfer, NVT).
  The model is studied in the case of two parties. When the number of votes for
the majority party follows a uniform distribution in each district, DVT results
in the greatest expected seat share, however, application of PVT, and,
especially, NVT increases the probability of winning the election. The
trade-off between vote transfer formulas and the number of list mandates
reveals that the majority party should use an appropriately calibrated NVT
system if it focuses on these two variables.",1607.02879v3,cs.GT,2016-07-11 09:58:58+00:00,[arxiv.Result.Author('L√°szl√≥ Csat√≥')],
202,Minimizing Margin of Victory for Fair Political and Educational Districting,"In many practical scenarios, a population is divided into disjoint groups for
better administration, e.g., electorates into political districts, employees
into departments, students into school districts, and so on. However, grouping
people arbitrarily may lead to biased partitions, raising concerns of
gerrymandering in political districting, racial segregation in schools, etc. To
counter such issues, in this paper, we conceptualize such problems in a voting
scenario, and propose FAIR DISTRICTING problem to divide a given set of people
having preference over candidates into k groups such that the maximum margin of
victory of any group is minimized. We also propose the FAIR CONNECTED
DISTRICTING problem which additionally requires each group to be connected. We
show that the FAIR DISTRICTING problem is NP-complete for plurality voting even
if we have only 3 candidates but admits polynomial time algorithms if we assume
k to be some constant or everyone can be moved to any group. In contrast, we
show that the FAIR CONNECTED DISTRICTING problem is NP-complete for plurality
voting even if we have only 2 candidates and k = 2. Finally, we propose
heuristic algorithms for both the problems and show their effectiveness in UK
political districting and in lowering racial segregation in public schools in
the US.",1909.05583v1,cs.SI,2019-09-12 11:50:25+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Ana-Andreea Stoica'), arxiv.Result.Author('Abhijnan Chakraborty'), arxiv.Result.Author('Palash Dey'), arxiv.Result.Author('Krishna P. Gummadi')]",
203,Gerrymandering and fair districting in parallel voting systems,"Switching from one electoral system to another one is frequently criticized
by the opposition and is viewed as a means for the ruling party to stay in
power. In particular, when the new electoral system is a parallel voting (or a
single-member district) system, the ruling party is usually suspected of a
biased way of partitioning the state into electoral districts such that based
on a priori knowledge it has more chances to win in a maximum possible number
of districts. In this paper, we propose a new methodology for deciding whether
a particular party benefits from a given districting map under a parallel
voting system. As a part of our methodology, we formulate and solve several
gerrymandering problems. We showcased the application of our approach to the
Moldovan parliamentary elections of 2019. Our results suggest that contrary to
the arguments of previous studies, there is no clear evidence to consider that
the districting map used in those elections was unfair.",2002.06849v1,physics.soc-ph,2020-02-17 09:17:24+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Igor Mandric'), arxiv.Result.Author('Igor Ro≈üca'), arxiv.Result.Author('Radu Buzatu')]",
204,Sampling-Based Winner Prediction in District-Based Elections,"In a district-based election, we apply a voting rule $r$ to decide the
winners in each district, and a candidate who wins in a maximum number of
districts is the winner of the election. We present efficient sampling-based
algorithms to predict the winner of such district-based election systems in
this paper. When $r$ is plurality and the margin of victory is known to be at
least $\varepsilon$ fraction of the total population, we present an algorithm
to predict the winner. The sample complexity of our algorithm is
$\mathcal{O}\left(\frac{1}{\varepsilon^4}\log
\frac{1}{\varepsilon}\log\frac{1}{\delta}\right)$. We complement this result by
proving that any algorithm, from a natural class of algorithms, for predicting
the winner in a district-based election when $r$ is plurality, must sample at
least $\Omega\left(\frac{1}{\varepsilon^4}\log\frac{1}{\delta}\right)$ votes.
We then extend this result to any voting rule $r$. Loosely speaking, we show
that we can predict the winner of a district-based election with an extra
overhead of
$\mathcal{O}\left(\frac{1}{\varepsilon^2}\log\frac{1}{\delta}\right)$ over the
sample complexity of predicting the single-district winner under $r$. We
further extend our algorithm for the case when the margin of victory is
unknown, but we have only two candidates. We then consider the median voting
rule when the set of preferences in each district is single-peaked. We show
that the winner of a district-based election can be predicted with
$\mathcal{O}\left(\frac{1}{\varepsilon^4}\log\frac{1}{\varepsilon}\log\frac{1}{\delta}\right)$
samples even when the harmonious order in different districts can be different

districts demands a concept of fairness, which is a loosely characterized, but
amorphous, concept that has evaded precise definition. We advance a new
paradigm to compare voting maps that avoids the pitfalls associated with an a
priori metric being used to uniformly assess maps. Our evaluative method
instead shows how to use uncertain data envelopment analysis to assess maps on
a variety of metrics, a tactic that permits each district to be assessed
separately and optimally. We test our methodology on a collection of proposed

their residential segregation patterns. Of these, 1200 are modeled on existing
cities, and 3000 are rectangular grid cities. In each city, we consider
single-member voting district plans for a hypothetical city council election. A
fair district plan is defined as one where the number of minority-majority
districts is proportional to the city-wide minority population. Thus each city
is summarized by three traits: minority percent, a measure of segregation, and
availability of a fair district plan. We find that when the minority population
is around 25%-33%, there is a positive correlation between the degree of
segregation and the availability of proportional district plan. Consistently,
when the minority population lives in a more diffuse residential pattern, there
are fewer available proportional district plans. Finally, we develop a new
method to validate runtime and sample size of an ensemble of district plans

unlikely to find plans that approach this maximum. A common search approach is
to use a biased random walk: preferentially select districting plans with more
majority-minority districts. Here, we present a third option, called short
bursts, in which an unbiased random walk is performed for a small number of
steps (called the burst length), then re-started from the most extreme plan
that was encountered in the last burst. We give empirical evidence that
short-burst runs outperform biased random walks for the problem of maximizing
the number of majority-minority districts, and that there are many values of
burst length for which we see this improvement. Abstracting from our use case,
we also consider short bursts where the underlying state space is a line with

210,District-Fair Participatory Budgeting,"Participatory budgeting is a method used by city governments to select public
projects to fund based on residents' votes. Many cities use participatory
budgeting at a district level. Typically, a budget is divided among districts
proportionally to their population, and each district holds an election over
local projects and then uses its budget to fund the projects most preferred by
its voters. However, district-level participatory budgeting can yield poor
social welfare because it does not necessarily fund projects supported across
multiple districts. On the other hand, decision making that only takes global
social welfare into account can be unfair to districts: A
social-welfare-maximizing solution might not fund any of the projects preferred
by a district, despite the fact that its constituents pay taxes to the city.
Thus, we study how to fairly maximize social welfare in a participatory
budgeting setting with a single city-wide election. We propose a notion of
fairness that guarantees each district at least as much welfare as it would
have received in a district-level election. We show that, although optimizing
social welfare subject to this notion of fairness is NP-hard, we can
efficiently construct a lottery over welfare-optimal outcomes that is fair in
expectation. Moreover, we show that, when we are allowed to slightly relax
fairness, we can efficiently compute a fair solution that is
welfare-maximizing, but which may overspend the budget.",2102.06115v1,cs.GT,2021-02-11 16:55:57+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('D Ellis Hershkowitz'), arxiv.Result.Author('Anson Kahng'), arxiv.Result.Author('Dominik Peters'), arxiv.Result.Author('Ariel D. Procaccia')]",

been extensively studied over the decades. Recently, the related literature has
focused on quantifying the impact of utilizing only limited information in the
voting process on the societal welfare for the outcome, by bounding the
distortion of voting rules. Even though there has been significant progress
towards this goal, all previous works have so far neglected the fact that in
many scenarios (like presidential elections) voting is actually a distributed
procedure. In this paper, we consider a setting in which the voters are
partitioned into disjoint districts and vote locally therein to elect local
winning alternatives using a voting rule; the final outcome is then chosen from
the set of these alternatives. We prove tight bounds on the distortion of
well-known voting rules for such distributed elections both from a worst-case
perspective as well as from a best-case one. Our results indicate that the
partition of voters into districts leads to considerably higher distortion, a

number of votes obtained by different parties remains unchanged. A less popular
party may end up winning more seats if their supporters are suitably
distributed spatially. This happens due to various regional and social
influences on individual voters which modulate their voting choice. In this
paper, we explore agent-based models for district-based elections, where we
consider each elector as an agent, and try to represent their social and
geographical attributes and political inclinations using probability
distributions. This model can be used to simulate election results by Monte
Carlo sampling. The models allow us to explore the full space of possible
outcomes of an electoral setting, though they can also be calibrated to actual
election results for suitable values of parameters. We use Approximate Bayesian

are equalization of losing votes and equalization of wasted votes, both of
which apply directly when the statewide vote is not 50% and which require, not
just partisan symmetry, but specific forms of the seats-votes curve. A new
measure of bias is introduced, based on the geometric area between the
seats-vote curve and the symmetrically inverted seats-votes curve. These
measures are applied to recent Pennsylvania congressional elections and to
abstract models of the seats-votes curves. The numerical values obtained from
the various measures of bias are compared and contrasted. Each bias measure has
merits for different seats-votes curves and for different elections, but all
essentially agree for most cases when applied to measure only partisan bias,
not conflated with competitiveness. This supports the inclusion of partisan

Winner takes all single-member districts -- both enables substantial partisan
gerrymandering and constrains `fair' redistricting, preventing proportional
representation in legislatures. We study the design of multi-member districts
(MMDs), in which each district elects multiple representatives, potentially
through a non-Winner takes all voting rule. We carry out large-scale empirical
analyses for the U.S. House of Representatives under MMDs with different social
choice functions, under algorithmically generated maps optimized for either
partisan benefit or proportionality. Doing so requires efficiently
incorporating predicted partisan outcomes -- under various multi-winner social
choice functions -- into an algorithm that optimizes over an ensemble of maps.
We find that with three-member districts using Single Transferable Vote,
fairness-minded independent commissions would be able to achieve proportional
outcomes in every state up to rounding, and advantage-seeking partisans would
have their power to gerrymander significantly curtailed. Simultaneously, such
districts would preserve geographic cohesion, an arguably important aspect of
representative democracies. In the process, we advance a rich research agenda

217,Electoral David vs Goliath: How does the Spatial Concentration of Electors affect District-based Elections?,"Many democratic countries use district-based elections where there is a
""seat"" for each district in the governing body. In each district, the party
whose candidate gets the maximum number of votes wins the corresponding seat.
The result of the election is decided based on the number of seats won by the
different parties. The electors (voters) can cast their votes only in the
district of their residence. Thus, locations of the electors and boundaries of
the districts may severely affect the election result even if the proportion of
popular support (number of electors) of different parties remains unchanged.
This has led to significant amount of research on whether the districts may be
redrawn or electors may be moved to maximize seats for a particular party. In
this paper, we frame the spatial distribution of electors in a probabilistic
setting, and explore different models to capture the intra-district
polarization of electors in favour of a party, or the spatial concentration of
supporters of different parties. Our models are inspired by elections in India,
where supporters of different parties tend to be concentrated in certain
districts. We show with extensive simulations that our model can capture
different statistical properties of real elections held in India. We frame
parameter estimation problems to fit our models to the observed election
results. Since analytical calculation of the likelihood functions are
infeasible for our complex models, we use Likelihood-free Inference methods
under the Approximate Bayesian Computation framework. Since this approach is
highly time-consuming, we explore how supervised regression using Logistic
Regression or Deep Neural Networks can be used to speed it up. We also explore
how the election results can change by varying the spatial distributions of the

briber. The briber needs to compute if the given partition can be modified so
that (i) the favorite alternative of the briber wins the resulting election,
(ii) the modification is budget feasible, and (iii) every new district is
connected. We study four natural variants of the above problem -- the graph on
voter being arbitrary vs complete graph (corresponds to removing connectedness
requirement for districts) and the cost of bribing every voter being uniform vs
non-uniform. We show that all the four problems are NP-complete even under

223,Quantifying Voter Biases in Online Platforms: An Instrumental Variable Approach,"In content-based online platforms, use of aggregate user feedback (say, the
sum of votes) is commonplace as the ""gold standard"" for measuring content
quality. Use of vote aggregates, however, is at odds with the existing
empirical literature, which suggests that voters are susceptible to different
biases -- reputation (e.g., of the poster), social influence (e.g., votes thus
far), and position (e.g., answer position). Our goal is to quantify, in an
observational setting, the degree of these biases in online platforms.
Specifically, what are the causal effects of different impression signals --
such as the reputation of the contributing user, aggregate vote thus far, and
position of content -- on a participant's vote on content? We adopt an
instrumental variable (IV) framework to answer this question. We identify a set
of candidate instruments, carefully analyze their validity, and then use the
valid instruments to reveal the effects of the impression signals on votes. Our
empirical study using log data from Stack Exchange websites shows that the bias
estimates from our IV approach differ from the bias estimates from the ordinary
least squares (OLS) method. In particular, OLS underestimates reputation bias
(1.6--2.2x for gold badges) and position bias (up to 1.9x for the initial
position) and overestimates social influence bias (1.8--2.3x for initial

assigning weights to the base classifiers according to their accuracy. This
paper proposes an agreement rate initialized maximum likelihood estimator
(ARIMLE) to optimally fuse the base classifiers. ARIMLE first uses a simplified
agreement rate method to estimate the classification accuracy of each base
classifier from the unlabeled samples, then employs the accuracies to
initialize a maximum likelihood estimator (MLE), and finally uses the
expectation-maximization algorithm to refine the MLE. Extensive experiments on
visually evoked potential classification in a brain-computer interface
application show that ARIMLE outperforms majority voting, and also achieves
better or comparable performance with several other state-of-the-art classifier

about what voters know about the voting situation. A strategizing voter is
typically assumed to know how other voters will vote and to know the rules of
the voting method. A growing body of literature explores strategic voting when
there is uncertainty about how others will vote. In this paper, we study
strategic voting when there is uncertainty about the voting method. We
introduce three notions of manipulability for a set of voting methods: sure,
safe, and expected manipulability. With the help of a computer program, we
identify voting scenarios in which uncertainty about the voting method may
reduce or even eliminate a voter's incentive to misrepresent her preferences.
Thus, it may be in the interest of an election designer who wishes to reduce
strategic voting to leave voters uncertain about which of several reasonable
voting methods will be used to determine the winners of an election.",1907.09110v1,cs.MA,2019-07-22 03:17:19+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Wesley H. Holliday'), arxiv.Result.Author('Eric Pacuit')]","EPTCS 297, 2019, pp. 252-272"

validation or governance tasks on blockchains. There is a majority of
well-behaving agents, but they may abstain or delegate their vote to other
agents since voting is costly. Misbehaving agents always vote. We compare
conventional voting allowing for abstention with vote delegation. Preferences
of voters are private information and a positive outcome is achieved if
well-behaving agents win. We illustrate that vote delegation leads to quite
different outcomes than conventional voting with abstention. In particular, we
obtain three insights: First, if the number of misbehaving voters, denoted by f
, is high, both voting methods fail to deliver a positive outcome. Second, if f
takes an intermediate value, conventional voting delivers a positive outcome,
while vote delegation fails with probability one. Third, if f is low,
delegation delivers a positive outcome with higher probability than
conventional voting. Finally, our results characterize worst-case outcomes that
can happen in a liquid democracy.",2102.08823v2,cs.GT,2021-02-17 15:32:32+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Hans Gersbach'), arxiv.Result.Author('Akaki Mamageishvili'), arxiv.Result.Author('Manvir Schneider')]",
232,To Vote Before Decide: A Logless One-Phase Commit Protocol for Highly-Available Datastores,"Highly-available datastores are widely deployed for online applications.
However, many online applications are not contented with the simple data access
interface currently provided by highly-available datastores. Distributed
transaction support is demanded by applications such as large-scale online
payment used by Alipay or Paypal. Current solutions to distributed transaction
can spend more than half of the whole transaction processing time in
distributed commit. An efficient atomic commit protocol is highly desirable.
This paper presents the HACommit protocol, a logless one-phase commit protocol
for highly-available systems. HACommit has transaction participants vote for a
commit before the client decides to commit or abort the transaction; in
comparison, the state-of-the-art practice for distributed commit is to have the
client decide before participants vote. The change enables the removal of both
the participant logging and the coordinator logging steps in the distributed
commit process; it also makes possible that, after the client initiates the
transaction commit, the transaction data is visible to other transactions
within one communication roundtrip time (i.e., one phase). In the evaluation
with extensive experiments, HACommit outperforms recent atomic commit solutions
for highly-available datastores under different workloads. In the best case,
HACommit can commit in one fifth of the time 2PC does.",1701.02408v2,cs.DC,2017-01-10 02:05:49+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Yuqing Zhu'), arxiv.Result.Author('Philip S.

team voting. We extend the standard Banzhaf metric to account for these cases;
our generalization reduces to the standard metric under ""random voting"", This

We study three of the most common methods used to modify voting rules to deal
with such partial votes. These methods modify scoring rules (like the Borda
count), elimination style rules (like single transferable vote) and rules based
on the tournament graph (like Copeland) respectively. We argue that with an
elimination style voting rule like single transferable vote, partial voting
does not change the situations where strategic voting is possible. However,
with scoring rules and rules based on the tournament graph, partial voting can
increase the situations where strategic voting is possible. As a consequence,
the computational complexity of computing a strategic vote can change. For
example, with Borda count, the complexity of computing a strategic vote can
decrease or stay the same depending on how we score partial votes.",1405.7714v1,cs.GT,2014-05-28 12:13:52+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Nina Narodytska'), arxiv.Result.Author('Toby Walsh')]",

electronic voting via electronic voting machines (EVMs) improves fairness by
relying on centralized trust. Homomorphic encryption-based voting protocols
also assure fairness but cannot scale to large scale elections such as
presidential elections. In this paper, we leverage the blockchain technology of
distributing trust to propose a smart contract-based protocol, namely, \proto.
There are many existing protocols for voting using smart contracts. We observe
that these either are not scalable or leak the vote tally during the voting
stage, i.e., do not provide vote concealment. In contrast, we show that FASTEN
preserves voter's privacy ensures vote concealment, immutability, and avoids
double voting. We prove that the probability of privacy breaches is negligibly
small. Further, our cost analysis of executing FASTEN over Ethereum is
comparable to most of the existing cost of elections.",2102.10594v1,cs.CR,2021-02-21 12:29:23+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Sankarshan Damle'), arxiv.Result.Author('Sujit Gujar'), arxiv.Result.Author('Moin Hussain Moti')]",
236,Using a Model of Social Dynamics to Predict Popularity of News,"Popularity of content in social media is unequally distributed, with some
items receiving a disproportionate share of attention from users. Predicting
which newly-submitted items will become popular is critically important for
both companies that host social media sites and their users. Accurate and
timely prediction would enable the companies to maximize revenue through
differential pricing for access to content or ad placement. Prediction would
also give consumers an important tool for filtering the ever-growing amount of
content. Predicting popularity of content in social media, however, is
challenging due to the complex interactions among content quality, how the
social media site chooses to highlight content, and influence among users.
While these factors make it difficult to predict popularity \emph{a priori}, we
show that stochastic models of user behavior on these sites allows predicting
popularity based on early user reactions to new content. By incorporating
aspects of the web site design, such models improve on predictions based on
simply extrapolating from the early votes. We validate this claim on the social
news portal Digg using a previously-developed model of social voting based on

(2) the incentives of the workers are not aligned with those of the requesters;
and (3) the interface does not allow workers to convey their knowledge

this paper, we address these issues by introducing approval voting to utilize
the expertise of workers who have partial knowledge of the true answer, and
coupling it with a (""strictly proper"") incentive-compatible compensation
mechanism. We show rigorous theoretical guarantees of optimality of our

239,"They may look and look, yet not see: BMDs cannot be tested adequately","Bugs, misconfiguration, and malware can cause ballot-marking devices (BMDs)
to print incorrect votes. Several approaches to testing BMDs have been
proposed. In logic and accuracy testing (LAT) and parallel or live testing,
auditors input known test votes into the BMD and check the printout. Passive
testing monitors the rate of ""spoiled"" BMD printout, on the theory that if BMDs
malfunction, the rate will increase noticeably. We show that these approaches
cannot reliably detect outcome-altering problems, because: (i) The number of
possible interactions with BMDs is enormous, so testing interactions uniformly
at random is hopeless. (ii) To probe the space of interactions intelligently
requires an accurate model of voter behavior, but because the space of
interactions is so large, building an accurate model requires observing a huge
number of voters in every jurisdiction in every election--more voters than
there are in most jurisdictions. (iii) Even with a perfect model of voter
behavior, the number of tests needed exceeds the number of voters in most
jurisdictions. (iv) An attacker can target interactions that are expensive to
test, e.g., because they involve voting slowly; or interactions for which
tampering is less likely to be noticed, e.g., because the voter uses the audio
interface. (v) Whether BMDs misbehave or not, the distribution of spoiled
ballots is unknown and varies by election and possibly by ballot style:
historical data do not help much. Hence, there is no way to calibrate a
threshold for passive testing, e.g., to guarantee at least a 95% chance of
noticing that 5% of the votes were altered, with at most a 5% false alarm rate.
(vi) Even if the distribution of spoiled ballots were known to be Poisson, the

242,Complexity of Manipulating Elections with Few Candidates,"In multiagent settings where the agents have different preferences,
preference aggregation is a central issue. Voting is a general method for
preference aggregation, but seminal results have shown that all general voting
protocols are manipulable. One could try to avoid manipulation by using voting
protocols where determining a beneficial manipulation is hard. Especially among
computational agents, it is reasonable to measure this hardness by
computational complexity. Some earlier work has been done in this area, but it
was assumed that the number of voters and candidates is unbounded. We derive
hardness results for practical multiagent settings where the number of
candidates is small but the number of voters can be large. We show that with
complete information about the others' votes, individual manipulation is easy,
and coalitional manipulation is easy with unweighted voters. However,
constructive coalitional manipulation with weighted voters is intractable for
all of the voting protocols under study, except for the nonrandomized Cup.
Destructive manipulation tends to be easier. Randomizing over instantiations of
the protocols (such as schedules of the Cup protocol) can be used to make
manipulation hard. Finally, we show that under weak assumptions, if weighted
coalitional manipulation with complete information about the others' votes is
hard in some voting protocol, then individual and unweighted manipulation is
hard when there is uncertainty about the others' votes.",cs/0205076v1,cs.GT,2002-05-29 20:27:58+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Vincent Conitzer'), arxiv.Result.Author('Tuomas Sandholm')]","Proceedings of the 18th National Conference on Artificial

248,"Voting on Cyclic Orders, Group Theory, and Ballots","A cyclic order may be thought of informally as a way to seat people around a
table, perhaps for a game of chance or for dinner. Given a set of agents such
as $\{A,B,C\}$, we can formalize this by defining a cyclic order as a
permutation or linear order on this finite set, under the equivalence relation
where $A\succ B\succ C$ is identified with both $B\succ C\succ A$ and $C\succ
A\succ B$. As with other collections of sets with some structure, we might want
to aggregate preferences of a (possibly different) set of voters on the set of
possible ways to choose a cyclic order.
  However, given the combinatorial explosion of the number of full rankings of
cyclic orders, one may not wish to use the usual voting machinery. This raises
the question of what sort of ballots may be appropriate; a single cyclic order,
a set of them, or some other ballot type? Further, there is a natural action of
the group of permutations on the set of agents. A reasonable requirement for a
choice procedure would be to respect this symmetry (the equivalent of
neutrality in normal voting theory).
  In this paper we will exploit the representation theory of the symmetric
group to analyze several natural types of ballots for voting on cyclic orders,
and points-based procedures using such ballots. We provide a full
characterization of such procedures for two quite different ballot types for

text from sessions of Congress that are four or more years removed from the

the heuristics they use to evaluate party based on political speech. Text-based
predictions are less accurate than those based on voting behavior, supporting
the theory that roll-call votes represent greater commitment on the part of
politicians and are thus a more accurate reflection of their ideological
preferences. However, the overall success of the machine learning approaches

identify voting scenarios in which uncertainty about the voting method may

253,Vote Delegation and Misbehavior,"We study vote delegation with ""well-behaving"" and ""misbehaving"" agents and
compare it with conventional voting. Typical examples for vote delegation are
validation or governance tasks on blockchains. There is a majority of
well-behaving agents, but they may abstain or delegate their vote to other
agents since voting is costly. Misbehaving agents always vote. We compare
conventional voting allowing for abstention with vote delegation. Preferences
of voters are private information and a positive outcome is achieved if
well-behaving agents win. We illustrate that vote delegation leads to quite
different outcomes than conventional voting with abstention. In particular, we
obtain three insights: First, if the number of misbehaving voters, denoted by f
, is high, both voting methods fail to deliver a positive outcome. Second, if f
takes an intermediate value, conventional voting delivers a positive outcome,
while vote delegation fails with probability one. Third, if f is low,
delegation delivers a positive outcome with higher probability than
conventional voting. Finally, our results characterize worst-case outcomes that
can happen in a liquid democracy.",2102.08823v2,cs.GT,2021-02-17 15:32:32+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Hans Gersbach'), arxiv.Result.Author('Akaki Mamageishvili'), arxiv.Result.Author('Manvir Schneider')]",

symbolic exploration of all traces of the considered processes which,

  In this paper, we overcome this difficulty by developing partial order
reduction techniques for the verification of security protocols. We provide
reduced transition systems that optimally eliminate redundant traces, and which
are adequate for model-checking trace equivalence properties of protocols by

on the tournament graph (like Copeland) respectively. We argue that with an
elimination style voting rule like single transferable vote, partial voting

with scoring rules and rules based on the tournament graph, partial voting can
increase the situations where strategic voting is possible. As a consequence,
the computational complexity of computing a strategic vote can change. For
example, with Borda count, the complexity of computing a strategic vote can
decrease or stay the same depending on how we score partial votes.",1405.7714v1,cs.GT,2014-05-28 12:13:52+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Nina Narodytska'), arxiv.Result.Author('Toby Walsh')]",

between hierarchical and direct voting systems for varying group sizes,
abstention rates, and voter competencies. Using asymptotic expansions of the
derivative of the reliability function (or Banzhaf number), we first prove that
indirect systems differ most from their direct counterparts when group size and
number are equal to each other, and therefore to $\sqrt{N_{\rm d}}$, where
$N_{\rm d}$ is the total number of voters in the direct system. In multitier
systems, we prove that this difference is maximized when group size equals
$\sqrt[n]{N_{\rm d}}$, where $n$ is the number of hierarchical levels. Second,
we show that while direct majority rule always outperforms hierarchical voting
for homogeneous electorates that vote with certainty, as group numbers and size
increase, hierarchical majority voting gains in its ability to represent all
eligible voters. Furthermore, when voter abstention and competency are
correlated within groups, hierarchical systems often outperform direct voting,

jurors vote honestly for the alternative they view more likely, given their
signal and prior voting, because they are experts who want to enhance their
reputation (after their vote and actual state of Nature is revealed). For a
fixed set of jury abilities, the reliability of the verdict depends on the
voting order. For a jury of size three, the optimal ordering is always as
follows: middle ability first, then highest ability, then lowest. For
sufficiently heterogeneous juries, sequential voting is more reliable than
simultaneous voting and is in fact optimal (allowing for non-honest voting).
When average ability is fixed, verdict reliability is increasing in

279,On Penrose's square-root law and beyond,"In certain bodies, like the Council of the EU, the member states have a
voting weight which depends on the population of the re- spective state. In
this article we ask the question which voting weight guarantees a `fair'
representation of the citizens in the union. The tra- ditional answer, the
square-root law by Penrose, is that the weight of a state (more precisely: the
voting power) should be proportional to the square-root of the population of
this state. The square root law is based on the assumption that the voters in
every state cast their vote inde- pendently of each other. In this paper we
concentrate on cases where the independence assumption is not valid.",math/0611418v1,math.PR,2006-11-14 10:53:27+00:00,[arxiv.Result.Author('Werner Kirsch')],
280,Power-Efficient Direct-Voting Assurance for Data Fusion in Wireless Sensor Networks,"Wireless sensor networks place sensors into an area to collect data and send
them back to a base station. Data fusion, which fuses the collected data before
they are sent to the base station, is usually implemented over the network.
Since the sensor is typically placed in locations accessible to malicious
attackers, information assurance of the data fusion process is very important.
A witness-based approach has been proposed to validate the fusion data. In this
approach, the base station receives the fusion data and ""votes"" on the data
from a randomly chosen sensor node. The vote comes from other sensor nodes,
called ""witnesses,"" to verify the correctness of the fusion data. Because the
base station obtains the vote through the chosen node, the chosen node could
forge the vote if it is compromised. Thus, the witness node must encrypt the
vote to prevent this forgery. Compared with the vote, the encryption requires
more bits, increasing transmission burden from the chosen node to the base
station. The chosen node consumes more power. This work improves the
witness-based approach using direct voting mechanism such that the proposed
scheme has better performance in terms of assurance, overhead, and delay. The
witness node transmits the vote directly to the base station. Forgery is not a
problem in this scheme. Moreover, fewer bits are necessary to represent the
vote, significantly reducing the power consumption. Performance analysis and
simulation results indicate that the proposed approach can achieve a 40 times
better overhead than the witness-based approach.",0705.3683v1,cs.CR,2007-05-25 02:56:47+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('H. -T. Pai'), arxiv.Result.Author('Y. S. Han')]",

283,Measuring and mitigating voting access disparities: a study of race and polling locations in Florida and North Carolina,"Voter suppression and associated racial disparities in access to voting are
long-standing civil rights concerns in the United States. Barriers to voting
have taken many forms over the decades. A history of violent explicit
discouragement has shifted to more subtle access limitations that can include
long lines and wait times, long travel times to reach a polling station, and
other logistical barriers to voting. Our focus in this work is on quantifying
disparities in voting access pertaining to the overall time-to-vote, and how
they could be remedied via a better choice of polling location or provisioning
more sites where voters can cast ballots. However, appropriately calibrating
access disparities is difficult because of the need to account for factors such
as population density and different community expectations for reasonable
travel times.
  In this paper, we quantify access to polling locations, developing a
methodology for the calibrated measurement of racial disparities in polling
location ""load"" and distance to polling locations. We apply this methodology to
a study of real-world data from Florida and North Carolina to identify
disparities in voting access from the 2020 election. We also introduce
algorithms, with modifications to handle scale, that can reduce these
disparities by suggesting new polling locations from a given list of identified
public locations (including schools and libraries). Applying these algorithms
on the 2020 election location data also helps to expose and explore tradeoffs
between the cost of allocating more polling locations and the potential impact
on access disparities. The developed voting access measurement methodology and
algorithmic remediation technique is a first step in better polling location

284,Testing for voter rigging in small polling stations,"Since the 1970s there has been a large number of countries that combine
formal democratic institutions with authoritarian practices. Although in such
countries the ruling elites may receive considerable voter support they often
employ several manipulation tools to control election outcomes. A common
practice of these regimes is the coercion and mobilization of a significant
amount of voters to guarantee the electoral victory. This electoral
irregularity is known as voter rigging, distinguishing it from vote rigging,
which involves ballot stuffing or stealing. Here we develop a statistical test
to quantify to which extent the results of a particular election display traces
of voter rigging. Our key hypothesis is that small polling stations are more
susceptible to voter rigging, because it is easier to identify opposing
individuals, there are less eye witnesses, and supposedly less visits from
election observers. We devise a general statistical method for testing whether
voting behavior in small polling stations is significantly different from the
behavior of their neighbor stations in a way that is consistent with the
widespread occurrence of voter rigging. Based on a comparative analysis, the
method enables to rule out whether observed differences in voting behavior
might be explained by geographic heterogeneities in vote preferences. We
analyze 21 elections in ten different countries and find significant anomalies
compatible with voter rigging in Russia from 2007-2011, in Venezuela from
2006-2013, and in Uganda 2011. Particularly disturbing is the case of Venezuela

such distributed elections, each voter has preferences over some set of

communicate with all sites. We are interested in designing
communication-efficient protocols, allowing the center to maintain a candidate
which, with arbitrarily high probability, is guaranteed to be a winner, or at
least close to being a winner. We consider various single-winner voting rules,
such as variants of Approval voting and scoring rules, tournament-based voting
rules, and several round-based voting rules. For the voting rules we consider,
we show that, using communication which is logarithmic in the number of voters,
it is possible for the center to maintain such approximate winners; that is,
upon a query at any time the center can immediately return a candidate which is
guaranteed to be an approximate winner with high probability. We complement our
protocols with lower bounds. Our results are theoretical in nature and relate
to various scenarios, such as aggregating customer preferences in online
shopping websites or supermarket chains and collecting votes from different

per person during the vote) and voter rigging (coercion and intimidation of
voters). Additionally, we perform tests to identify numerical anomalies in the

polling stations. Voting information is gathered gradually, often with no
guarantee of obtaining the complete sample or even information in all the
strata. However, accurate interval estimates with partial information must be
obtained. Furthermore, this becomes more challenging if the strata are
additionally study domains. To produce partial estimates, two strategies are
proposed: 1) A Bayesian model using a dynamic post-stratification strategy and
a single imputation process defined after a thorough analysis of historic
voting information. Additionally, a credibility level correction is included to
solve the underestimation of the variance; 2) a frequentist alternative that
combines standard multiple imputation ideas with classic sampling techniques to
obtain estimates under a missing information framework. Both solutions are

290,A Novel Hybrid Biometric Electronic Voting System: Integrating Finger Print and Face Recognition,"A novel hybrid design based electronic voting system is proposed, implemented
and analyzed. The proposed system uses two voter verification techniques to
give better results in comparison to single identification based systems.
Finger print and facial recognition based methods are used for voter
identification. Cross verification of a voter during an election process
provides better accuracy than single parameter identification method. The
facial recognition system uses Viola-Jones algorithm along with rectangular
Haar feature selection method for detection and extraction of features to
develop a biometric template and for feature extraction during the voting
process. Cascaded machine learning based classifiers are used for comparing the
features for identity verification using GPCA (Generalized Principle Component
Analysis) and K-NN (K-Nearest Neighbor). It is accomplished through comparing
the Eigen-vectors of the extracted features with the biometric template
pre-stored in the election regulatory body database. The results of the
proposed system show that the proposed cascaded design based system performs
better than the systems using other classifiers or separate schemes i.e. facial
or finger print based schemes. The proposed system will be highly useful for
real time applications due to the reason that it has 91% accuracy under nominal
light in terms of facial recognition. with bags of paper votes. The central
station compiles and publishes the names of winners and losers through
television and radio stations. This method is useful only if the whole process

been based on traditional machine learning approaches or time series modelling.
We propose here an alternate approach based on deep learning algorithms for
forecasting strawberry yields and prices in Santa Barbara county, California.
Building the proposed forecasting model comprises three stages: first, the
station-based ensemble model (ATT-CNN-LSTM-SeriesNet_Ens) with its compound
deep learning components, SeriesNet with Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) and
Convolutional Neural Network LSTM with Attention layer (Att-CNN-LSTM), are
trained and tested using the station-based soil temperature and moisture data
of SantaBarbara as input and the corresponding strawberry yields or prices as
output. Secondly, the remote sensing ensemble model (SIM_CNN-LSTM_Ens), which
is an ensemble model of Convolutional NeuralNetwork LSTM (CNN-LSTM) models, is
trained and tested using satellite images of the same county as input mapped to
the same yields and prices as output. These two ensembles forecast strawberry
yields and prices with minimal forecasting errors and highest model correlation
for five weeks ahead forecasts.Finally, the forecasts of these two models are
ensembled to have a final forecasted value for yields and prices by introducing
a voting ensemble. Based on an aggregated performance measure (AGM), it is
found that this voting ensemble not only enhances the forecasting performance
by 5% compared to its best performing component model but also outperforms the

different outcomes than conventional voting with abstention. In particular, we
obtain three insights: First, if the number of misbehaving voters, denoted by f
, is high, both voting methods fail to deliver a positive outcome. Second, if f
takes an intermediate value, conventional voting delivers a positive outcome,
while vote delegation fails with probability one. Third, if f is low,

present an unsupervised machine-learning (UML) method for morphological
classification of galaxies, which can be summarized as two aspects: (1) the
methodology of convolutional autoencoder (CAE) is used to reduce the dimensions
and extract features from the imaging data; (2) the bagging-based
multiclustering model is proposed to obtain the classifications with high
confidence at the cost of rejecting the disputed sources that are
inconsistently voted. We apply this method on the sample of galaxies with
$H<24.5$ in CANDELS. Galaxies are clustered into 100 groups, each contains
galaxies with analogous characteristics. To explore the robustness of the
morphological classifications, we merge 100 groups into five categories by
visual verification, including spheroid, early-type disk, late-type disk,
irregular, and unclassifiable. After eliminating the unclassifiable category
and the sources with inconsistent voting, the purity of the remaining four
subclasses are significantly improved. Massive galaxies ($M_*>10^{10}M_\odot$)
are selected to investigate the connection with other physical properties. The
classification scheme separates galaxies well in the U-V and V-J color space
and Gini-$M_{20}$ space. The gradual tendency of S\'{e}rsic indexes and
effective radii is shown from the spheroid subclass to the irregular subclass.
It suggests that the combination of CAE and multi-clustering strategy is an
effective method to cluster galaxies with similar features and can yield
high-quality morphological classifications. Our study demonstrates the
feasibility of UML in morphological analysis that would develop and serve the

the majority voting method is most stable to this random vote corruption, among
voting methods where each person has a small influence on the election. We

306,Heuristics in Multi-Winner Approval Voting,"In many real world situations, collective decisions are made using voting.
Moreover, scenarios such as committee or board elections require voting rules

the votes and choosing the top-$k$ candidates receiving the most votes. An
agent may manipulate the vote to achieve a better outcome by voting in a way
that does not reflect their true preferences. In complex and uncertain
situations, agents may use heuristics to strategize, instead of incurring the
additional effort required to compute the manipulation which most favors them.
In this paper, we examine voting behavior in multi-winner approval voting
scenarios with complete information. We show that people generally manipulate
their vote to obtain a better outcome, but often do not identify the optimal
manipulation. Instead, voters tend to prioritize the candidates with the
highest utilities. Using simulations, we demonstrate the effectiveness of these

according to a distribution $\pi$, and let $n$ go to infinity, then for any
$\epsilon >0$, with probability at least $1-\epsilon$, the minimum number of
operations that are needed for the strategic individual to achieve her goal
falls into one of the following four categories: (1) 0, (2) $\Theta(\sqrt n)$,
(3) $\Theta(n)$, and (4) $\infty$. This theorem holds for any set of vote
operations, any individual vote distribution $\pi$, and any integer generalized
scoring rule, which includes (but is not limited to) almost all commonly
studied voting rules, e.g., approval voting, all positional scoring rules
(including Borda, plurality, and veto), plurality with runoff, Bucklin,
Copeland, maximin, STV, and ranked pairs.
  We also show that many well-studied types of strategic behavior fall under
our framework, including (but not limited to) constructive/destructive
manipulation, bribery, and control by adding/deleting votes, margin of victory,
and minimum manipulation coalition size. Therefore, our main theorem naturally

about what voters know about the voting situation. A strategizing voter is
typically assumed to know how other voters will vote and to know the rules of
the voting method. A growing body of literature explores strategic voting when
there is uncertainty about how others will vote. In this paper, we study
strategic voting when there is uncertainty about the voting method. We
introduce three notions of manipulability for a set of voting methods: sure,
safe, and expected manipulability. With the help of a computer program, we
identify voting scenarios in which uncertainty about the voting method may
reduce or even eliminate a voter's incentive to misrepresent her preferences.
Thus, it may be in the interest of an election designer who wishes to reduce
strategic voting to leave voters uncertain about which of several reasonable
voting methods will be used to determine the winners of an election.",1907.09110v1,cs.MA,2019-07-22 03:17:19+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Wesley H. Holliday'), arxiv.Result.Author('Eric Pacuit')]","EPTCS 297, 2019, pp. 252-272"

the outcome of the election the same, regardless of the changes to the votes.
It is well known that the US electoral college system is about 5 times more
likely to have a changed outcome due to vote corruption, when compared to a
majority vote. In fact, Mossel, O'Donnell and Oleszkiewicz proved in 2005 that
the majority voting method is most stable to this random vote corruption, among
voting methods where each person has a small influence on the election. We
discuss some recent progress on the analogous result for elections between more
than two candidates. In this case, plurality should be most stable to
corruption in votes. We also survey results on adversarial election

in a non-random way), and we briefly discuss ranked choice voting methods

a weighted voting game. It depends on the number of coalitions in which the
agent is the difference in the coalition winning or losing. It is well known

comprehensive classification of weighted voting games which can be solved in
polynomial time. Among other results, we provide a polynomial

338,How Many Vote Operations Are Needed to Manipulate A Voting System?,"In this paper, we propose a framework to study a general class of strategic
behavior in voting, which we call vote operations. We prove the following
theorem: if we fix the number of alternatives, generate $n$ votes i.i.d.
according to a distribution $\pi$, and let $n$ go to infinity, then for any
$\epsilon >0$, with probability at least $1-\epsilon$, the minimum number of
operations that are needed for the strategic individual to achieve her goal
falls into one of the following four categories: (1) 0, (2) $\Theta(\sqrt n)$,
(3) $\Theta(n)$, and (4) $\infty$. This theorem holds for any set of vote
operations, any individual vote distribution $\pi$, and any integer generalized
scoring rule, which includes (but is not limited to) almost all commonly
studied voting rules, e.g., approval voting, all positional scoring rules
(including Borda, plurality, and veto), plurality with runoff, Bucklin,
Copeland, maximin, STV, and ranked pairs.
  We also show that many well-studied types of strategic behavior fall under
our framework, including (but not limited to) constructive/destructive
manipulation, bribery, and control by adding/deleting votes, margin of victory,

340,Predicting Missing Information of Key Aspects in Vulnerability Reports,"Software vulnerabilities have been continually disclosed and documented. An
important practice in documenting vulnerabilities is to describe the key
vulnerability aspects, such as vulnerability type, root cause, affected
product, impact, attacker type and attack vector, for the effective search and
management of fast-growing vulnerabilities. We investigate 120,103
vulnerability reports in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) over
the past 20 years. We find that 56%, 85%, 38% and 28% of CVEs miss
vulnerability type, root causes, attack vector and attacker type respectively.
To help to complete the missing information of these vulnerability aspects, we
propose a neural-network based approach for predicting the missing information
of a key aspect of a vulnerability based on the known aspects of the
vulnerability. We explore the design space of the neural network models and
empirically identify the most effective model design. Using a large-scale
vulnerability datas\-et from CVE, we show that we can effectively train a
neural-network based classifier with less than 20% of historical CVEs. Our
model achieves the prediction accuracy 94%, 79%, 89%and 70% for vulnerability

341,LEOPARD: Identifying Vulnerable Code for Vulnerability Assessment through Program Metrics,"Identifying potentially vulnerable locations in a code base is critical as a
pre-step for effective vulnerability assessment; i.e., it can greatly help
security experts put their time and effort to where it is needed most.
Metric-based and pattern-based methods have been presented for identifying
vulnerable code. The former relies on machine learning and cannot work well due
to the severe imbalance between non-vulnerable and vulnerable code or lack of
features to characterize vulnerabilities. The latter needs the prior knowledge
of known vulnerabilities and can only identify similar but not new types of
vulnerabilities.
  In this paper, we propose and implement a generic, lightweight and extensible
framework, LEOPARD, to identify potentially vulnerable functions through
program metrics. LEOPARD requires no prior knowledge about known
vulnerabilities. It has two steps by combining two sets of systematically
derived metrics. First, it uses complexity metrics to group the functions in a
target application into a set of bins. Then, it uses vulnerability metrics to
rank the functions in each bin and identifies the top ones as potentially
vulnerable. Our experimental results on 11 real-world projects have
demonstrated that, LEOPARD can cover 74.0% of vulnerable functions by
identifying 20% of functions as vulnerable and outperform machine
learning-based and static analysis-based techniques. We further propose three
applications of LEOPARD for manual code review and fuzzing, through which we
discovered 22 new bugs in real applications like PHP, radare2 and FFmpeg, and
eight of them are new vulnerabilities.",1901.11479v2,cs.SE,2019-01-31 17:09:15+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Xiaoning Du'), arxiv.Result.Author('Bihuan Chen'), arxiv.Result.Author('Yuekang Li'), arxiv.Result.Author('Jianmin Guo'), arxiv.Result.Author('Yaqin Zhou'), arxiv.Result.Author('Yang Liu'), arxiv.Result.Author('Yu Jiang')]",

vulnerabilities. However, the large number of vulnerabilities reported and
associated with these tools make the exhaustive testing of these tools
infeasible against these vulnerabilities infeasible. As an instance of general
software testing problem, the research question to address is whether the
system under test is robust and secure against these vulnerabilities. This
paper introduces the idea of ``vulnerability coverage,'' a concept to
adequately test a given application for a certain classes of vulnerabilities,
as reported by the National Vulnerability Database (NVD). The deriving idea is
to utilize the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) as a means to measure
the fitness of test inputs generated by evolutionary algorithms and then
through pattern matching identify vulnerabilities that match the generated

344,On the Threat of npm Vulnerable Dependencies in Node.js Applications,"Software vulnerabilities have a large negative impact on the software systems
that we depend on daily. Reports on software vulnerabilities always paint a
grim picture, with some reports showing that 83% of organizations depend on
vulnerable software. However, our experience leads us to believe that, in the
grand scheme of things, these software vulnerabilities may have less impact
than what is reported. Therefore, we perform a study to better understand the
threat of npm vulnerable packages used in Node.js applications. We define three
threat levels for vulnerabilities in packages, based on their lifecycle, where
a package vulnerability is assigned a low threat level if it was hidden or
still unknown at the time it was used in the dependent application (t), medium
threat level if the vulnerability was reported but not yet published at t, and
high if it was publicly announced at t. Then, we perform an empirical study
involving 6,673 real-world, active, and mature open source Node.js
applications. Our findings show that although 67.93% of the examined
applications depend on at least one vulnerable package, 94.91% of the
vulnerable packages in those affected applications are classified as having low
threat. Moreover, we find that in the case of vulnerable packages classified as
having high threat, it is the application's lack of updating that makes them
vulnerable, i.e., it is not the existence of the vulnerability that is the real
problem. Furthermore, we verify our findings at different stages of the
application's lifetime and find that our findings still hold. Our study argues
that when it comes to software vulnerabilities, things may not be as bad as
they seem and that considering vulnerability threat is key.",2009.09019v1,cs.SE,2020-09-18 18:45:21+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Mahmoud Alfadel'), arxiv.Result.Author('Diego Elias Costa'), arxiv.Result.Author('Mouafak Mokhallalati'), arxiv.Result.Author('Emad Shihab'), arxiv.Result.Author('Bram Adams')]",
345,Vulnerability Detection with Fine-grained Interpretations,"Despite the successes of machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) based
vulnerability detectors (VD), they are limited to providing only the decision
on whether a given code is vulnerable or not, without details on what part of
the code is relevant to the detected vulnerability. We present IVDetect an
interpretable vulnerability detector with the philosophy of using Artificial
Intelligence (AI) to detect vulnerabilities, while using Intelligence Assistant
(IA) via providing VD interpretations in terms of vulnerable statements.
  For vulnerability detection, we separately consider the vulnerable statements
and their surrounding contexts via data and control dependencies. This allows
our model better discriminate vulnerable statements than using the mixture of
vulnerable code and~contextual code as in existing approaches. In addition to
the coarse-grained vulnerability detection result, we leverage interpretable AI
to provide users with fine-grained interpretations that include the sub-graph
in the Program Dependency Graph (PDG) with the crucial statements that are
relevant to the detected vulnerability. Our empirical evaluation on
vulnerability databases shows that IVDetect outperforms the existing DL-based
approaches by 43%--84% and 105%--255% in top-10 nDCG and MAP ranking scores.
IVDetect correctly points out the vulnerable statements relevant to the

vulnerabilities together in a Vulnerability Management Program (VMP), the
researcher postulated new terminology. The terminology of vulnerability
chaining blindness is proposed to understand the underlying issues behind
vulnerability management and vulnerabilities that can be used in combination.
The general problem is that IT and cybersecurity professionals have a difficult
time identifying chained vulnerabilities due to the complexity of vulnerability
prioritization and remediation (Abomhara & K{\o}ien, 2015; Felmetsger et al.,
2010). The specific problem is the inability to link and view multiple
vulnerabilities in combination based on limited expertise and awareness of
vulnerability chaining (Tang et al., 2017). The population of this study was
limited to one focus group, within the IT and Security fields, within the
United States. The sample size consisted of one focus group comprised of 8-10
IT and cybersecurity professionals. The research questions focused on if
participants were aware of linkage blindness or vulnerability chaining, as well
as if vulnerability chaining blindness would be applicable to describe the
phenomenon. Several themes emerged through top-level, eclectic, and
second-level coding data analysis. These themes included complexity in
cybersecurity programs, new concepts in vulnerability management, as well as
fear of the unknown and where security meets technology.

347,Examining the Relationship of Code and Architectural Smells with Software Vulnerabilities,"Context: Security is vital to software developed for commercial or personal
use. Although more organizations are realizing the importance of applying
secure coding practices, in many of them, security concerns are not known or
addressed until a security failure occurs. The root cause of security failures
is vulnerable code. While metrics have been used to predict software
vulnerabilities, we explore the relationship between code and architectural
smells with security weaknesses. As smells are surface indicators of a deeper
problem in software, determining the relationship between smells and software
vulnerabilities can play a significant role in vulnerability prediction models.
Objective: This study explores the relationship between smells and software
vulnerabilities to identify the smells. Method: We extracted the class, method,
file, and package level smells for three systems: Apache Tomcat, Apache CXF,
and Android. We then compared their occurrences in the vulnerable classes which
were reported to contain vulnerable code and in the neutral classes
(non-vulnerable classes where no vulnerability had yet been reported). Results:
We found that a vulnerable class is more likely to have certain smells compared
to a non-vulnerable class. God Class, Complex Class, Large Class, Data Class,
Feature Envy, Brain Class have a statistically significant relationship with
software vulnerabilities. We found no significant relationship between
architectural smells and software vulnerabilities. Conclusion: We can conclude

effective security solutions. Fortunately, the evaluation of vulnerability
databases that use a framework for communicating vulnerability attributes and
their severity scores, such as the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS),

this paper, we characterize the software vulnerability landscape by performing
a historical and statistical analysis of CVSS vulnerability metrics over the
period of 2005 to 2019 through using data from the National Vulnerability
Database. We conduct three studies analyzing the following: the distribution of
CVSS scores (both empirical and theoretical), the distribution of CVSS metric
values and how vulnerability characteristics change over time, and the relative
rankings of the most frequent metric value over time. Our resulting analysis
shows that the vulnerability threat landscape has been dominated by only a few
vulnerability types and has changed little during the time period of the study.
The overwhelming majority of vulnerabilities are exploitable over the network.
The complexity to successfully exploit these vulnerabilities is dominantly low;
very little authentication to the target victim is necessary for a successful
attack. And most of the flaws require very limited interaction with users.
However on the positive side, the damage of these vulnerabilities is mostly
confined within the security scope of the impacted components. A discussion of
lessons that could be learned from this analysis is presented.",2102.01722v1,cs.CR,2021-02-02 19:35:50+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Assane Gueye'), arxiv.Result.Author('Peter Mell')]",

  We devise a block design experiment with 67 software engineering students
with varying vulnerability information and measure scoring accuracy under
different information sets.
  We find that baseline vulnerability descriptions provided by standard
vulnerability sources provide only part of the information needed to achieve an
accurate vulnerability assessment. Further, we find that additional information
on \texttt{assets}, \texttt{attacks}, and \texttt{vulnerability type}
contributes in increasing the accuracy of the assessment; conversely,
information on \texttt{known threats} misleads the assessor and decreases
assessment accuracy and should be avoided when assessing vulnerabilities. These
results go in the direction of formalizing the vulnerability communication to,
for example, fully automate security assessments.",1803.07648v1,cs.CR,2018-03-20 20:51:07+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Luca Allodi'), arxiv.Result.Author('Sebastian Banescu'), arxiv.Result.Author('Henning Femmer'), arxiv.Result.Author('Kristian Beckers')]","Proceedings of the 2018 ACM Conference on Data and Application

357,$Œº$VulDeePecker: A Deep Learning-Based System for Multiclass Vulnerability Detection,"Fine-grained software vulnerability detection is an important and challenging
problem. Ideally, a detection system (or detector) not only should be able to
detect whether or not a program contains vulnerabilities, but also should be
able to pinpoint the type of a vulnerability in question. Existing
vulnerability detection methods based on deep learning can detect the presence
of vulnerabilities (i.e., addressing the binary classification or detection
problem), but cannot pinpoint types of vulnerabilities (i.e., incapable of
addressing multiclass classification). In this paper, we propose the first deep
learning-based system for multiclass vulnerability detection, dubbed
$\mu$VulDeePecker. The key insight underlying $\mu$VulDeePecker is the concept
of code attention, which can capture information that can help pinpoint types
of vulnerabilities, even when the samples are small. For this purpose, we
create a dataset from scratch and use it to evaluate the effectiveness of
$\mu$VulDeePecker. Experimental results show that $\mu$VulDeePecker is
effective for multiclass vulnerability detection and that accommodating
control-dependence (other than data-dependence) can lead to higher detection
capabilities.",2001.02334v1,cs.CR,2020-01-08 01:47:22+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Deqing Zou'), arxiv.Result.Author('Sujuan Wang'), arxiv.Result.Author('Shouhuai Xu'), arxiv.Result.Author('Zhen Li'), arxiv.Result.Author('Hai Jin')]",
358,Attack Potential in Impact and Complexity,"Vulnerability exploitation is reportedly one of the main attack vectors
against computer systems. Yet, most vulnerabilities remain unexploited by
attackers. It is therefore of central importance to identify vulnerabilities
that carry a high `potential for attack'. In this paper we rely on Symantec
data on real attacks detected in the wild to identify a trade-off in the Impact
and Complexity of a vulnerability, in terms of attacks that it generates;
exploiting this effect, we devise a readily computable estimator of the
vulnerability's Attack Potential that reliably estimates the expected volume of
attacks against the vulnerability. We evaluate our estimator performance
against standard patching policies by measuring foiled attacks and demanded
workload expressed as the number of vulnerabilities entailed to patch. We show
that our estimator significantly improves over standard patching policies by
ruling out low-risk vulnerabilities, while maintaining invariant levels of
coverage against attacks in the wild. Our estimator can be used as a first aid
for vulnerability prioritisation to focus assessment efforts on high-potential
vulnerabilities.",1801.04703v1,cs.CR,2018-01-15 09:03:27+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Luca Allodi'), arxiv.Result.Author('Fabio Massacci')]","Proceedings of the 12th International Conference on Availability,

359,VulDeePecker: A Deep Learning-Based System for Vulnerability Detection,"The automatic detection of software vulnerabilities is an important research
problem. However, existing solutions to this problem rely on human experts to
define features and often miss many vulnerabilities (i.e., incurring high false
negative rate). In this paper, we initiate the study of using deep
learning-based vulnerability detection to relieve human experts from the
tedious and subjective task of manually defining features. Since deep learning
is motivated to deal with problems that are very different from the problem of
vulnerability detection, we need some guiding principles for applying deep
learning to vulnerability detection. In particular, we need to find
representations of software programs that are suitable for deep learning. For
this purpose, we propose using code gadgets to represent programs and then
transform them into vectors, where a code gadget is a number of (not
necessarily consecutive) lines of code that are semantically related to each
other. This leads to the design and implementation of a deep learning-based
vulnerability detection system, called Vulnerability Deep Pecker
(VulDeePecker). In order to evaluate VulDeePecker, we present the first
vulnerability dataset for deep learning approaches. Experimental results show
that VulDeePecker can achieve much fewer false negatives (with reasonable false
positives) than other approaches. We further apply VulDeePecker to 3 software
products (namely Xen, Seamonkey, and Libav) and detect 4 vulnerabilities, which
are not reported in the National Vulnerability Database but were ""silently""
patched by the vendors when releasing later versions of these products; in

not sufficient to reconstruct see-saw, a feature which we refer to as ``see-saw
degeneracy''. Indirect tests of see-saw are leptogenesis and lepton flavor
violation in supersymmetric scenarios, which together with neutrino mass and
mixing define the framework of see-saw phenomenology. Several examples are
given, both phenomenological and GUT-related. Variants of the see-saw mechanism
like the type II or triplet see-saw are also discussed. In particular, we
compare many general aspects regarding the dependence of LFV on low energy
neutrino parameters in the extreme cases of a dominating conventional see-saw
term or a dominating triplet term. For instance, the absence of mu -> e gamma
or tau -> e gamma in the pure triplet case means that CP is conserved in
neutrino oscillations. Scanning models, we also find that among the decays mu

380,A Machine Learning Approach to Correcting Atmospheric Seeing in Solar Flare Observations,"Current post-processing techniques for the correction of atmospheric seeing
in solar observations -- such as Speckle interferometry and Phase Diversity
methods -- have limitations when it comes to their reconstructive capabilities
of solar flare observations. This, combined with the sporadic nature of flares
meaning observers cannot wait until seeing conditions are optimal before taking
measurements, means that many ground-based solar flare observations are marred
with bad seeing. To combat this, we propose a method for dedicated flare seeing
correction based on training a deep neural network to learn to correct
artificial seeing from flare observations taken during good seeing conditions.
This model uses transfer learning, a novel technique in solar physics, to help
learn these corrections. Transfer learning is when another network already
trained on similar data is used to influence the learning of the new network.
Once trained, the model has been applied to two flare datasets: one from
AR12157 on 2014/09/06 and one from AR12673 on 2017/09/06. The results show good
corrections to images with bad seeing with a relative error assigned to the

383,Typical duration of good seeing sequences at Concordia,"Context: The winter seeing at Concordia is essentially bimodal, excellent or
quite poor, with relative proportions that depend on altitude above the snow
surface. This paper studies the temporal behavior of the good seeing sequences.
Aims: An efficient exploitation of extremely good seeing with an adaptive
optics system needs long integrations. It is then important to explore the
temporal distribution of the fraction of time providing excellent seeing.
Methods: Temporal windows of good seeing are created by a simple binary
process. Good or bad. Their autocorrelations are corrected for those of the
existing data sets, since these are not continuous, being often interrupted by
technical problems in addition to the adverse weather gaps. At the end these
corrected autocorrelations provide the typical duration of good seeing
sequences. This study has to be a little detailed as its results depend on the
season, summer or winter. Results: Using a threshold of 0.5 arcsec to define
the ""good seeing"", three characteristic numbers are found to describe the
temporal evolution of the good seeing windows. The first number is the mean
duration of an uninterrupted good seeing sequence: it is $\tau_0=7.5$ hours at
8 m above the ground (15 hours at 20 m). These sequences are randomly
distributed in time, with a negative exponential law of damping time
$\tau_1=29$ hours (at elevation 8 m and 20 m). The third number is the mean
time between two 29 hours episodes. It is T=10 days at 8 m high (5 days at 20
m).",1003.3583v1,astro-ph.IM,2010-03-18 14:09:06+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Eric Fossat'), arxiv.Result.Author('Eric Aristidi'), arxiv.Result.Author('Karim Agabi'), arxiv.Result.Author('Erick Bondoux'), arxiv.Result.Author('Zalpha Challita'), arxiv.Result.Author('Francois Jeanneaux'), arxiv.Result.Author('Djamel Mekarnia')]",
384,Excellent daytime seeing at Dome Fuji on the Antarctic plateau,"Context. Dome Fuji, the second highest region on the Antarctic plateau, is
expected to have some of the best astronomical seeing on Earth. However, site
testing at Dome Fuji is still in its very early stages.
  Aims. To investigate the astronomical seeing in the free atmosphere above
Dome Fuji, and to determine the height of the surface boundary layer.
  Methods. A Differential Image Motion Monitor was used to measure the seeing
in the visible (472 nm) at a height of 11 m above the snow surface at Dome Fuji
during the austral summer of 2012/2013.
  Results. Seeing below 0.2'' has been observed. The seeing often has a local
minimum of ~0.3'' near 18 h local time. Some periods of excellent seeing, 0.3''
or smaller, were also observed, sometimes extending for several hours at local
midnight. The median seeing is higher, at 0.52''---this large value is believed
to be caused by periods when the telescope was within the turbulent boundary
layer.
  Conclusions. The diurnal variation of the daytime seeing at Dome Fuji is
similar to that reported for Dome C, and the height of the surface boundary
layer is consistent with previous simulations for Dome Fuji. The free
atmosphere seeing is ~0.2'', and the height of the surface boundary layer can
be as low as ~11 m.",1305.5109v1,astro-ph.IM,2013-05-22 12:38:07+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('H. Okita'), arxiv.Result.Author('T. Ichikawa'), arxiv.Result.Author('M. C. B. Ashley'), arxiv.Result.Author('N. Takato')]",
385,Night-time measurements of astronomical seeing at Dome A in Antarctica,"Seeing, the angular size of stellar images blurred by atmospheric turbulence,
is a critical parameter used to assess the quality of astronomical sites.
Median values at the best mid-latitude sites are generally in the range of
0.6--0.8\,arcsec. Sites on the Antarctic plateau are characterized by
comparatively-weak turbulence in the free-atmosphere above a strong but thin
boundary layer. The median seeing at Dome C is estimated to be 0.23--0.36
arcsec above a boundary layer that has a typical height of 30\,m. At Dome A and
F, the only previous seeing measurements were made during daytime. Here we
report the first direct measurements of night-time seeing at Dome A, using a
Differential Image Motion Monitor. Located at a height of just 8\,m, it
recorded seeing as low as 0.13\,arcsec, and provided seeing statistics that are
comparable to those for a 20\,m height at Dome C. It indicates that the
boundary layer was below 8\,m 31\% of the time. At such times the median seeing
was 0.31\,arcsec, consistent with free-atmosphere seeing. The seeing and
boundary layer thickness are found to be strongly correlated with the
near-surface temperature gradient. The correlation confirms a median thickness
of approximately 14\,m for the boundary layer at Dome A, as found from a sonic
radar. The thinner boundary layer makes it less challenging to locate a
telescope above it, thereby giving greater access to the free-atmosphere.",2007.15365v1,astro-ph.IM,2020-07-30 10:36:24+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Bin Ma'), arxiv.Result.Author('Zhaohui Shang'), arxiv.Result.Author('Yi Hu'), arxiv.Result.Author('Keliang Hu'), arxiv.Result.Author('Yongjiang Wang'), arxiv.Result.Author('Xu Yang'), arxiv.Result.Author('Michael C.

justifiably high confidence that the reported results of an election are
consistent with an audit trail (""ballots""), which can be paper or electronic.
SOBA combines three ideas: (1) publishing cast vote records (CVRs) separately
for each contest, so that anyone can verify that each reported contest outcome
is correct, if the CVRs reflect voters' intentions with sufficient accuracy;
(2) shrouding a mapping between ballots and the CVRs for those ballots to
prevent the loss of privacy that could occur otherwise; (3) assessing the
accuracy with which the CVRs reflect voters' intentions for a collection of
contests while simultaneously assessing the integrity of the shrouded mapping
between ballots and CVRs by comparing randomly selected ballots to the CVRs
that purport to represent them. Step (1) is related to work by the Humboldt
County Election Transparency Project, but publishing CVRs separately for
individual contests rather than images of entire ballots preserves privacy.
Step (2) requires a cryptographic commitment from elections officials.
Observers participate in step (3), which relies on the ""super-simple
simultaneous single-ballot risk-limiting audit."" Step (3) is designed to reveal
relatively few ballots if the shrouded mapping is proper and the CVRs
accurately reflect voter intent. But if the reported outcomes of the contests

protocol that publicly demonstrates a one-to-one correspondence between the
cryptographically-secured electronic vote records and the easily understandable
paper records, while protecting individual voter secrecy and polling
booth-level voting statistics. This one-to-one correspondence helps each

efficient and principled recovery in case of tally mismatches, by pinpointing
mismatching votes and their associated polling booths. We propose a novel

decrypt each vote. Ballot sheets are encrypted by onion-routing, which has a
layer with the key of the election instance, so it's impossible for a quorum to
decode the results before they have announced their decision by exposing their
keys. A register of voters ensures that only verified voters can vote without
compromising their identity. If there any doubts about the identity of a voter,
their vote can be excluded from the election, if a quorum agrees. This system

incorrect reported outcomes before the outcomes are certified. The most
efficient use ballot-level comparison, comparing the voting system's
interpretation of individual ballot cards sampled at random (cast-vote records,
CVRs) from a trustworthy paper trail to a human interpretation of the same
cards. Such comparisons require the voting system to create and export CVRs in
a way that can be linked to the individual ballots the CVRs purport to
represent. Such links can be created by keeping the ballots in the order in
which they are scanned or by printing a unique serial number on each ballot.
But for precinct-count systems (PCOS), these strategies may compromise vote
anonymity: the order in which ballots are cast may identify the voters who cast
them. Printing a unique pseudo-random number (""cryptographic nonce"") on each
ballot card after the voter last touches it could reduce such privacy risks.
But what if the system does not in fact print a unique number on each ballot or
does not accurately report the numbers it printed? This paper gives two ways to
conduct an RLA so that even if the system does not print a genuine nonce on
each ballot or misreports the nonces it used, the audit's risk limit is not
compromised (however, the anonymity of votes might be compromised). One method
allows untrusted technology to be used to imprint and to retrieve ballot cards.
The method is adaptive: if the technology behaves properly, this protection
does not increase the audit workload. But if the imprinting or retrieval system
misbehaves, the sample size the RLA requires to confirm the reported results
when the results are correct is generally larger than if the imprinting and

DSN as a usable service in a truly decentralized manner, the blockchain comes
in handy -- to record and verify audit trails in forms of proof of storage, and

  Leaving the audit trails on the blockchain offers transparency and fairness,
yet it 1) sacrifices privacy, as they may leak information about the data under

specifies additive utilities over $m$ candidate projects with given sizes, and
the goal is to choose a subset of projects (i.e., a committee) with total size
at most $k$. Participatory budgeting mathematically generalizes multiwinner
elections, and both have received great attention in computational social
choice recently. A well-studied notion of group fairness in this setting is
core stability: Each voter is assigned an ""entitlement"" of $\frac{k}{n}$, so
that a subset $S$ of voters can pay for a committee of size at most $|S| \cdot
\frac{k}{n}$. A given committee is in the core if no subset of voters can pay
for another committee that provides each of them strictly larger utility. This
provides proportional representation to all voters in a strong sense.
  In this paper, we study the following auditing question: Given a committee
computed by some preference aggregation method, how close is it to the core?
Concretely, how much does the entitlement of each voter need to be scaled down
by, so that the core property subsequently holds? As our main contribution, we
present computational hardness results for this problem, as well as a
logarithmic approximation algorithm via linear program rounding. We show that
our analysis is tight against the linear programming bound. Additionally, we
consider two related notions of group fairness that have similar audit
properties. The first is Lindahl priceability, which audits the closeness of a
committee to a market clearing solution. We show that this is related to the
linear programming relaxation of auditing the core, leading to efficient exact
and approximation algorithms for auditing. The second is a novel weakening of
the core that we term the sub-core, and we present computational results for

even the most carefully designed systems necessarily leak information via the
announced result. In corner cases, this may be problematic. For example, if all
the votes go to one candidate then all vote privacy evaporates. The mere
possibility of candidates getting no or few votes could have implications for
security in practice: if a coercer demands that a voter cast a vote for such an
unpopular candidate, then the voter may feel obliged to obey, even if she is
confident that the voting system satisfies the standard coercion resistance
definitions. With complex ballots, there may also be a danger of ""Italian""
style (aka ""signature"") attacks: the coercer demands the voter cast a ballot
with a specific, identifying pattern. Here we propose an approach to tallying
end-to-end verifiable schemes that avoids revealing all the votes but still
achieves whatever confidence level in the announced result is desired. Now a
coerced voter can claim that the required vote must be amongst those that
remained shrouded. Our approach is based on the well-established notion of
Risk-Limiting Audits, but here applied to the tally rather than to the audit.
We show that this approach counters coercion threats arising in extreme tallies

405,Phrase-Verified Voting: Verifiable Low-Tech Remote Boardroom Voting,"We present Phrase-Verified Voting, a voter-verifiable remote voting system
assembled from commercial off-the-shelf software for small private elections.
The system is transparent and enables each voter to verify that the tally
includes their ballot selection without requiring any understanding of
cryptography. This paper describes the system and its use in fall 2020, to vote
remotely in promotion committees in a university. Each voter fills out a form
in the cloud with their vote V (YES, NO, ABSTAIN) and a passphrase P-two words
entered by the voter. The system generates a verification prompt of the (P,V)
pairs and a tally of the votes, organized to help visualize how the votes add
up. After the polls close, each voter verifies that this table lists their
(P,V) pair and that the tally is computed correctly. The system is especially
appropriate for any small group making sensitive decisions. Because the system
would not prevent a coercer from demanding that their victim use a specified
passphrase, it is not designed for applications where such malfeasance would be
likely or go undetected. Results from 43 voters show that the system was
well-accepted, performed effectively for its intended purpose, and introduced
users to the concept of voter-verified elections. Compared to the commonly-used
alternatives of paper ballots or voting by email, voters found the system
easier to use, and that it provided greater privacy and outcome integrity.",2103.07180v1,cs.CR,2021-03-12 09:59:55+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Enka Blanchard'), arxiv.Result.Author('Ryan Robucci'), arxiv.Result.Author('Ted Selker'), arxiv.Result.Author('Alan Sherman')]",
406,A mathematical evaluation of vote transfer systems,"The paper builds a general model of vote transfer systems on the basis of the
current Hungarian electoral rules. It combines single-seat districts and list
mandates with three possible compensation rule for 'wasted' votes in
constituencies: no compensation (direct vote transfer, DVT), compensation for
votes cast for losing party candidates (positive vote transfer, PVT) and
compensation for all votes that are not necessary to win the district (negative
vote transfer, NVT).
  The model is studied in the case of two parties. When the number of votes for
the majority party follows a uniform distribution in each district, DVT results
in the greatest expected seat share, however, application of PVT, and,
especially, NVT increases the probability of winning the election. The
trade-off between vote transfer formulas and the number of list mandates
reveals that the majority party should use an appropriately calibrated NVT
system if it focuses on these two variables.",1607.02879v3,cs.GT,2016-07-11 09:58:58+00:00,[arxiv.Result.Author('L√°szl√≥ Csat√≥')],

are equalization of losing votes and equalization of wasted votes, both of
which apply directly when the statewide vote is not 50% and which require, not
just partisan symmetry, but specific forms of the seats-votes curve. A new
measure of bias is introduced, based on the geometric area between the
seats-vote curve and the symmetrically inverted seats-votes curve. These
measures are applied to recent Pennsylvania congressional elections and to
abstract models of the seats-votes curves. The numerical values obtained from
the various measures of bias are compared and contrasted. Each bias measure has
merits for different seats-votes curves and for different elections, but all
essentially agree for most cases when applied to measure only partisan bias,
not conflated with competitiveness. This supports the inclusion of partisan
fairness as a fundamental element for election law reform, and some options are
discussed.",1505.06749v1,physics.soc-ph,2015-05-25 20:27:21+00:00,[arxiv.Result.Author('John F. Nagle')],Election Law Journal 14 (2015) 346-360

discussions are commonly seen as a way of reaching better decisions compared to
solutions that do not require coordination between the individuals (e.g.
voting)---through discussion, the sum becomes greater than the parts. However,
this assumption is not irrefutable: anecdotal evidence of wasteful discussions
abounds, and in our own experiments we find that over 30% of discussions are
unproductive.
  We propose a framework for analyzing conversational dynamics in order to
determine whether a given task-oriented discussion is worth having or not. We
exploit conversational patterns reflecting the flow of ideas and the balance
between the participants, as well as their linguistic choices. We apply this
framework to conversations naturally occurring in an online collaborative world

411,Alleviating partisan gerrymandering: can math and computers help to eliminate wasted votes?,"Partisan gerrymandering is a major cause for voter disenfranchisement in
United States. However, convincing US courts to adopt specific measures to
quantify gerrymandering has been of limited success to date. Recently,
Stephanopoulos and McGhee introduced a new and precise measure of partisan
gerrymandering via the so-called ""efficiency gap"" that computes the absolutes
difference of wasted votes between two political parties in a two-party system.
Quite importantly from a legal point of view, this measure was found legally
convincing enough in a US appeals court in a case that claims that the
legislative map of the state of Wisconsin was gerrymandered; the case is now
pending in US Supreme Court. In this article, we show the following:
  (a) We provide interesting mathematical and computational complexity
properties of the problem of minimizing the efficiency gap measure. To the best
of our knowledge, these are the first non-trivial theoretical and algorithmic
analyses of this measure of gerrymandering.
  (b) We provide a simple and fast algorithm that can ""un-gerrymander"" the
district maps for the states of Texas, Virginia, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania by
bring their efficiency gaps to acceptable levels from the current unacceptable
levels. Our work thus shows that, notwithstanding the general worst case
approximation hardness of the efficiency gap measure as shown by us,finding
district maps with acceptable levels of efficiency gaps is a computationally
tractable problem from a practical point of view. Based on these empirical
results, we also provide some interesting insights into three practical issues
related the efficiency gap measure.
  We believe that, should the US Supreme Court uphold the decision of lower
courts, our research work and software will provide a crucial supporting hand
to remove partisan gerrymandering.",1804.10577v1,cs.CY,2018-04-27 16:12:11+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Tanima Chatterjee'), arxiv.Result.Author('Bhaskar DasGupta'), arxiv.Result.Author('Laura Palmieri'), arxiv.Result.Author('Zainab Al-Qurashi'), arxiv.Result.Author('Anastasios Sidiropoulos')]",

wasted, because the GKP qubits have been treated as only discrete variables. In
this paper, we propose a hybrid quantum error correction approach that combines
digital information with the analog information of the GKP qubits using the
maximum-likelihood method. As an example, we demonstrate that the three-qubit
bit-flip code can correct double errors, whereas the conventional method based
on majority voting on the binary measurement outcome can correct only a single
error. As another example, a concatenated code known as Knill's C4/C6 code can
achieve the hashing bound for the quantum capacity of the Gaussian quantum
channel. To the best of our knowledge, this approach is the first attempt to
draw both digital and analog information from a single quantum state to improve

groups of agents who would prefer an alternative allocation might challenge it.
An assignment is popular if it is not challenged by another one. By assuming
that agents' ability to challenge allocations can be represented by weighted
votes, we characterize the conditions under which popular allocations might
exist and when these can be implemented via strategy-proof mechanisms. Serial
dictatorships that use orderings consistent with the agents' weights are not
only strategy-proof and Pareto efficient, but also popular, whenever these

about what voters know about the voting situation. A strategizing voter is
typically assumed to know how other voters will vote and to know the rules of
the voting method. A growing body of literature explores strategic voting when
there is uncertainty about how others will vote. In this paper, we study
strategic voting when there is uncertainty about the voting method. We
introduce three notions of manipulability for a set of voting methods: sure,
safe, and expected manipulability. With the help of a computer program, we
identify voting scenarios in which uncertainty about the voting method may
reduce or even eliminate a voter's incentive to misrepresent her preferences.
Thus, it may be in the interest of an election designer who wishes to reduce
strategic voting to leave voters uncertain about which of several reasonable
voting methods will be used to determine the winners of an election.",1907.09110v1,cs.MA,2019-07-22 03:17:19+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Wesley H. Holliday'), arxiv.Result.Author('Eric Pacuit')]","EPTCS 297, 2019, pp. 252-272"

agents since voting is costly. Misbehaving agents always vote. We compare
conventional voting allowing for abstention with vote delegation. Preferences
of voters are private information and a positive outcome is achieved if
well-behaving agents win. We illustrate that vote delegation leads to quite
different outcomes than conventional voting with abstention. In particular, we
obtain three insights: First, if the number of misbehaving voters, denoted by f
, is high, both voting methods fail to deliver a positive outcome. Second, if f
takes an intermediate value, conventional voting delivers a positive outcome,
while vote delegation fails with probability one. Third, if f is low,
delegation delivers a positive outcome with higher probability than
conventional voting. Finally, our results characterize worst-case outcomes that

ability to amplify small physical quantities. However, the low postselection

application in practice, since it may waste resources, and reduce the
measurement precision. An improved protocol was proposed in [Phys. Rev. Lett.
113, 030401 (2014)] to make the postselected weak measurement dramatically more
efficient by using entanglement. Such a protocol can increase the Fisher
information of the measurement to approximately saturate the well-known
Heisenberg limit. In this paper, we review the entanglement-assisted protocol
of postselected weak measurement in detail, and study its robustness against
technical noises. We focus on readout errors. Readout errors can greatly
degrade the performance of postselected weak measurement, especially when the
readout error probability is comparable to the postselection probability. We
show that entanglement can significantly reduce the two main detrimental
effects of readout errors: inaccuracy in the measurement result, and the loss
of Fisher information. We extend the protocol by introducing a majority vote
scheme to postselection to further compensate for readout errors. With a proper
threshold, almost no Fisher information will be lost. These results demonstrate
the effectiveness of entanglement in protecting postselected weak measurement

on the tournament graph (like Copeland) respectively. We argue that with an
elimination style voting rule like single transferable vote, partial voting
does not change the situations where strategic voting is possible. However,
with scoring rules and rules based on the tournament graph, partial voting can
increase the situations where strategic voting is possible. As a consequence,
the computational complexity of computing a strategic vote can change. For
example, with Borda count, the complexity of computing a strategic vote can
decrease or stay the same depending on how we score partial votes.",1405.7714v1,cs.GT,2014-05-28 12:13:52+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Nina Narodytska'), arxiv.Result.Author('Toby Walsh')]",

elements, hydrogen or helium. Because of their surface high gravitational
field, heavy elements diffuse downwards in a very short timescale compared to
the evolutionary timescale, leaving the lightest ones on the top of the
envelope. This results in the main classification of white dwarfs as hydrogen
rich or helium rich. But many helium rich white dwarfs show also the presence
of hydrogen traces in their atmosphere, whose origin is still unsettled. Here
we study, by means of full evolutionary calculations, the case for a
representative model of the ""He-H-Z"" white dwarfs, a sub-group of helium rich
white dwarfs showing both heavy elements and a large amount of hydrogen in
their atmosphere. We find it impossible to explain its hydrogen atmospheric

447,Limiting Risk by Turning Manifest Phantoms into Evil Zombies,"Drawing a random sample of ballots to conduct a risk-limiting audit generally
requires knowing how the ballots cast in an election are organized into groups,
for instance, how many containers of ballots there are in all and how many
ballots are in each container. A list of the ballot group identifiers along
with number of ballots in each group is called a ballot manifest. What if the
ballot manifest is not accurate? Surprisingly, even if ballots are known to be
missing from the manifest, it is not necessary to make worst-case assumptions
about those ballots--for instance, to adjust the margin by the number of
missing ballots--to ensure that the audit remains conservative. Rather, it
suffices to make worst-case assumptions about the individual randomly selected
ballots that the audit cannot find. This observation provides a simple
modification to some risk-limiting audit procedures that makes them
automatically become more conservative if the ballot manifest has errors. The
modification--phantoms to evil zombies (~2EZ)--requires only an upper bound on
the total number of ballots cast. ~2EZ makes the audit P-value stochastically
larger than it would be had the manifest been accurate, automatically requiring
more than enough ballots to be audited to offset the manifest errors. This
ensures that the true risk limit remains smaller than the nominal risk limit.
On the other hand, if the manifest is in fact accurate and the upper bound on
the total number of ballots equals the total according to the manifest, ~2EZ
has no effect at all on the number of ballots audited nor on the true risk
limit.",1207.3413v1,stat.AP,2012-07-14 11:26:02+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Jorge H. Banuelos'), arxiv.Result.Author('Philip B. Stark')]",

selections on a BMD. We then required them to examine their ballots for any
changes from the slate they used to vote. Overall accuracy was exceptionally
high. Participants saw 1440 total contests, and of those 1440, there were a
total of 4 errors, so total accuracy was 99.8%. Participants were able to
perform with near-perfect accuracy regardless of ballot length, ballot type,
number of altered races, and location of altered races. Detection performance
was extremely robust. We conclude that with proper direction and resources,
voters can be near-perfect detectors of ballot changes on printed paper ballots

real ballots of any strict subset of districts at a price corresponding to the
willingness to sell on the part of the citizens holding such ballots. By
contrast, decoy voters are trapped into selling their ballots at a low, or even
negligible, price. Blowing up the adversary's budget by introducing decoy
ballots may thus turn out to be futile. The Devil's Menu can also be applied to

452,The ATHENA Class of Risk-Limiting Ballot Polling Audits,"The main risk-limiting ballot polling audit in use today, BRAVO, is designed
for use when single ballots are drawn at random and a decision regarding
whether to stop the audit or draw another ballot is taken after each ballot
draw (ballot-by-ballot (B2) audits). On the other hand, real ballot polling
audits draw many ballots in a single round before determining whether to stop
(round-by-round (R2) audits). We show that BRAVO results in significant
inefficiency when directly applied to real R2 audits. We present the ATHENA
class of R2 stopping rules, which we show are risk-limiting if the round
schedule is pre-determined (before the audit begins). We prove that each rule
is at least as efficient as the corresponding BRAVO stopping rule applied at
the end of the round. We have open-source software libraries implementing most
of our results.
  We show that ATHENA halves the number of ballots required, for all state
margins in the 2016 US Presidential election and a first round with $90\%$
stopping probability, when compared to BRAVO (stopping rule applied at the end
of the round). We present simulation results supporting the 90% stopping
probability claims and our claims for the risk accrued in the first round.
Further, ATHENA reduces the number of ballots by more than a quarter for low
margins, when compared to the BRAVO stopping rule applied on ballots in
selection order. This implies that keeping track of the order when drawing
ballots R2 is not beneficial, because ATHENA is more efficient even without
information on selection order. These results are significant because current
approaches to real ballot polling election audits use the B2 BRAVO rules,
requiring about twice as much work on the part of election officials. Applying
the rules in selection order requires fewer ballots, but keeping track of the
order, and entering it into audit software, adds to the effort.",2008.02315v5,cs.CR,2020-08-05 18:47:37+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Filip Zag√≥rski'), arxiv.Result.Author('Grant McClearn'), arxiv.Result.Author('Sarah Morin'), arxiv.Result.Author('Neal McBurnett'), arxiv.Result.Author('Poorvi L.

top. Unlike conventional methods of picking a ballot at random, $k$-cut does
not require identification numbers on the ballots or counting many ballots per

sampling; (3) it can start in polling places on election night, before margins
are known. If the reported margins for the 2016 U.S. Presidential election are

justifiably high confidence that the reported results of an election are
consistent with an audit trail (""ballots""), which can be paper or electronic.
SOBA combines three ideas: (1) publishing cast vote records (CVRs) separately
for each contest, so that anyone can verify that each reported contest outcome
is correct, if the CVRs reflect voters' intentions with sufficient accuracy;
(2) shrouding a mapping between ballots and the CVRs for those ballots to
prevent the loss of privacy that could occur otherwise; (3) assessing the
accuracy with which the CVRs reflect voters' intentions for a collection of
contests while simultaneously assessing the integrity of the shrouded mapping
between ballots and CVRs by comparing randomly selected ballots to the CVRs
that purport to represent them. Step (1) is related to work by the Humboldt
County Election Transparency Project, but publishing CVRs separately for
individual contests rather than images of entire ballots preserves privacy.
Step (2) requires a cryptographic commitment from elections officials.
Observers participate in step (3), which relies on the ""super-simple
simultaneous single-ballot risk-limiting audit."" Step (3) is designed to reveal
relatively few ballots if the shrouded mapping is proper and the CVRs
accurately reflect voter intent. But if the reported outcomes of the contests

Recent studies (e.g., Bernhard, et al. 2020) suggest the verification rate is

simply choose not to attempt verification in the first place. In order to
understand this problem, we conducted an experiment in which 108 participants
participated in a mock election where the BMD displayed the voters' true
choices, but then changed a subset of those choices on the printed ballot. The
design of the printed ballot, the length of the ballot, the number of changes
that were made to the ballot, the location of those changes, and the
instructions provided to the voters were manipulated as part of the experiment.
Results indicated that of those voters who chose to examine the printed ballot,
76% detected anomalies, indicating that voters can reliably detect errors on

traditional plurality voting in which voters submit rankings over the

influence the outcome of an election, given fixed voter preferences. We show
that there exist preference profiles over $k$ candidates such that up to $k-1$
different candidates win at different ballot lengths. We derive exact lower
bounds on the number of voters required for such profiles and provide a
construction matching the lower bound for unrestricted voter preferences.
Additionally, we characterize which sequences of winners are possible over
ballot lengths and provide explicit profile constructions achieving any
feasible winner sequence. We also examine how classic preference restrictions
influence our results--for instance, single-peakedness makes $k-1$ different
winners impossible but still allows at least $\Omega(\sqrt k)$. Finally, we
analyze a collection of 168 real-world elections, where we truncate rankings to
simulate shorter ballots. We find that shorter ballots could have changed the

Moreover, each voter should have equal influence. Traditionally, this has been

renewed attention in spatial statistics. This extension of Dynkin's theory
associates the de Wijs process with the (recurrent) Brownian motion on the two

489,The winner takes all: Volume-scavenging populations of networked droplets,"In this work we present and analyze a fluid-mechanical model of competition
(scavenging) amongst $N$ liquid droplets (individual competitors). The eventual
outcome of this competition depends sensitively on the average resource
(volume) per individual $\overline{V}$. For abundant resource,
$\overline{V}>1$, there is one winner only and that winner eventually scavenges
all or most of the resource. In the socio-economic realm this is is known as
the ""winner-take-all"" outcome: A disproportionately large reward falls to one
or a few winners, even though other competitors start out with comparable (or
even slightly more) resource and perform only marginally worse. The losing
competitors are not rewarded. For less than abundant resource,
$\overline{V}<1$, an outcome with resource that is evenly partitioned amongst
the $N$ droplets becomes possible. This is the ""all-share-evenly"" or
egalitarian outcome. For sufficiently scarce resource the egalitarian outcome
is the only one that can occur. In addition to predicting what kind and how
many winners, our analysis shows that once an individual's resource (droplet
volume) falls below a fixed threshold, that individual can neither recover nor
emerge as winner. This is the ""once down-and-out, always down-and-out"" outcome.
Selected simulations suggest that the winner depends sensitively on population
size and the ""trading friction"" or inefficiency of resource exchange between
individuals (liquid rheology). Of all feasible rest states (equilibria), only
certain ones are reachable (stable equilibria). Friction turns out to strongly

particular class of the afore-mentioned phenomena, namely on mesoscopic level
self-organisation of functional brain networks under fMRI imaging, where we

addressed to the neuroscientific community, our work Piekniewski and Schreiber

networks with full mathematical rigour in context of their asymptotic spectral
properties, well known to be of interest for neuroscientific community. Our

495,Will the Winner Take All? Competing Influences in Social Networks Under Information Overload,"Influence competition finds its significance in many applications, such as
marketing, politics and public events like COVID-19. Existing work tends to
believe that the stronger influence will always win and dominate nearly the
whole network, i.e., ""winner takes all"". However, this finding somewhat
contradicts with our common sense that many competing products are actually
coexistent, e.g., Android vs. iOS. This contradiction naturally raises the
question: will the winner take all?
  To answer this question, we make a comprehensive study into influence
competition by identifying two factors frequently overlooked by prior art: (1)
the incomplete observation of real diffusion networks; (2) the existence of
information overload and its impact on user behaviors. To this end, we attempt
to recover possible diffusion links based on user similarities, which are
extracted by embedding users into a latent space. Following this, we further
derive the condition under which users will be overloaded, and formulate the
competing processes where users' behaviors differ before and after information
overload. By establishing the explicit expressions of competing dynamics, we
disclose that information overload acts as the critical ""boundary line"", before
which the ""winner takes all"" phenomenon will definitively occur, whereas after
information overload the share of influences gradually stabilizes and is
jointly affected by their initial spreading conditions, influence powers and
the advent of overload. Numerous experiments are conducted to validate our
theoretical results where favorable agreement is found. Our work sheds light on
the intrinsic driving forces behind real-world dynamics, thus providing useful
insights into effective information engineering.",2104.14086v1,cs.SI,2021-04-29 03:11:15+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Chen Feng'), arxiv.Result.Author('Jiahui Sun'), arxiv.Result.Author('Luiyi Fu')]",

497,Identifying Possible Winners in Ranked Choice Voting Elections with Outstanding Ballots,"Several election districts in the US have recently moved to ranked-choice
voting (RCV) to decide the results of local elections. RCV allows voters to
rank their choices, and the results are computed in rounds, eliminating one
candidate at a time. RCV ensures fairer elections and has been shown to
increase elected representation of women and people of color. A main drawback
of RCV is that the round-by-round process requires all the ballots to be
tallied before the results of an election can be calculated. With increasingly
large portions of ballots coming from absentee voters, RCV election outcomes
are not always apparent on election night, and can take several weeks to be
published, leading to a loss of trust in the electoral process from the public.
In this paper, we present an algorithm for efficiently computing possible
winners of RCV elections from partially known ballots and evaluate it on data
from the recent New York City Primary elections. We show that our techniques
allow to significantly narrow down the field of possible election winners, and
in some case identify the winner as soon as election night despite a number of

and an alternative (candidate) c, two important questions arise: first, is it
still possible for c to win, and second, is c guaranteed to win? These are the
possible winner and necessary winner problems, respectively. Each of these two
problems is further divided into two sub-problems: determining whether c is a
unique winner (that is, c is the only winner), or determining whether c is a
co-winner (that is, c is in the set of winners). We consider the setting where
the number of alternatives is unbounded and the votes are unweighted. We

fewer people. At the same time, when the payoff of a process depends on a
parameter choice that is symmetric with respect to agents, all agents have the
incentive to choose the values of the parameter that lead to higher payoffs. We
explore the trade-off between these two considerations, with a focus on a
particular example. This example can be seen as a simple model for the
situation where a group of friends bet against each other about the top-scoring
team in a sports league. We obtain analytic characterizations of the symmetric
equilibria in the case of only 2 agents and in the case where there are only
two possible top-scorers. We also conduct some simulations beyond these cases,

505,Combatting Gerrymandering with Social Choice: the Design of Multi-member Districts,"Every representative democracy must specify a mechanism under which voters

Winner takes all single-member districts -- both enables substantial partisan
gerrymandering and constrains `fair' redistricting, preventing proportional
representation in legislatures. We study the design of multi-member districts
(MMDs), in which each district elects multiple representatives, potentially
through a non-Winner takes all voting rule. We carry out large-scale empirical
analyses for the U.S. House of Representatives under MMDs with different social
choice functions, under algorithmically generated maps optimized for either
partisan benefit or proportionality. Doing so requires efficiently
incorporating predicted partisan outcomes -- under various multi-winner social
choice functions -- into an algorithm that optimizes over an ensemble of maps.
We find that with three-member districts using Single Transferable Vote,
fairness-minded independent commissions would be able to achieve proportional
outcomes in every state up to rounding, and advantage-seeking partisans would
have their power to gerrymander significantly curtailed. Simultaneously, such
districts would preserve geographic cohesion, an arguably important aspect of
representative democracies. In the process, we advance a rich research agenda

Despite these differences, the two-fluid model provides a consistent
description of the WOMBAT plasma configuration and yields qualitative agreement

dispersion curve is sensitive to the axial field strength and the electron
temperature, and the dependence of oscillation frequency with electron
temperature matches the experiment. These results consolidate earlier claims
that the density and floating potential oscillations are a resistive drift

(CO$_2$) and other important greenhouse gases are changing in response to human
influences. These changes need to be quantified to understand climate change
and its impacts, but this is difficult to do because natural fluxes occur over
large spatial and temporal scales. To infer trends in fluxes and identify phase
shifts and amplitude changes in flux seasonal cycles, we construct a
flux-inversion system that uses a novel spatially varying time-series
decomposition of the fluxes, while also accommodating physical constraints on
the fluxes. We incorporate these features into the Wollongong Methodology for
Bayesian Assimilation of Trace-gases (WOMBAT, Zammit-Mangion et al., Geosci.

CO$_2$ mole fraction from the Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2 (OCO-2) satellite
and direct measurements of CO$_2$ mole fraction from a variety of sources. We
estimate the changes to CO$_2$ fluxes that occurred from January 2015 to
December 2020, and compare our posterior estimates to those from an alternative
method based on a bottom-up understanding of the physical processes involved.
We find substantial trends in the fluxes, including that tropical ecosystems
trended from being a net source to a net sink of CO$_2$ over the study period.
We also find that the amplitude of the global seasonal cycle of ecosystem
CO$_2$ fluxes increased over the study period by 0.11 PgC/month (an increase of

vacuum arc centrifuge, a cylindrical, rapidly rotating, low temperature and
confined plasma column, is applied to interpret plasma oscillations in a RF
generated linear magnetised plasma (WOMBAT), with similar density and field
strength. Compared to typical centrifuge plasmas, WOMBAT plasmas have slower
normalised rotation frequency, lower temperature and lower axial velocity.
Despite these differences, the two-fluid model provides a consistent
description of the WOMBAT plasma configuration and yields qualitative agreement
between measured and predicted wave oscillation frequencies with axial field
strength. In addition, the radial profile of the density perturbation predicted
by this model is consistent with the data. Parameter scans show that the
dispersion curve is sensitive to the axial field strength and the electron
temperature, and the dependence of oscillation frequency with electron
temperature matches the experiment. These results consolidate earlier claims
that the density and floating potential oscillations are a resistive drift
mode, driven by the density gradient. To our knowledge, this is the first
detailed physics model of flowing plasmas in the diffusion region away from the

balancing developed in collaboration with performance engineers at Cray Inc.
This will allow us scale simulation to the exaflop regime and achieve kpc

522,"Inferring changes to the global carbon cycle with WOMBAT v2.0, a hierarchical flux-inversion framework","The natural cycles of the surface-to-atmosphere fluxes of carbon dioxide
(CO$_2$) and other important greenhouse gases are changing in response to human
influences. These changes need to be quantified to understand climate change
and its impacts, but this is difficult to do because natural fluxes occur over
large spatial and temporal scales. To infer trends in fluxes and identify phase
shifts and amplitude changes in flux seasonal cycles, we construct a
flux-inversion system that uses a novel spatially varying time-series
decomposition of the fluxes, while also accommodating physical constraints on
the fluxes. We incorporate these features into the Wollongong Methodology for
Bayesian Assimilation of Trace-gases (WOMBAT, Zammit-Mangion et al., Geosci.

posterior distributions for all unknowns in the underlying model. We apply the
new method, which we call WOMBAT v2.0, to a mix of satellite observations of
CO$_2$ mole fraction from the Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2 (OCO-2) satellite
and direct measurements of CO$_2$ mole fraction from a variety of sources. We
estimate the changes to CO$_2$ fluxes that occurred from January 2015 to
December 2020, and compare our posterior estimates to those from an alternative
method based on a bottom-up understanding of the physical processes involved.
We find substantial trends in the fluxes, including that tropical ecosystems
trended from being a net source to a net sink of CO$_2$ over the study period.
We also find that the amplitude of the global seasonal cycle of ecosystem
CO$_2$ fluxes increased over the study period by 0.11 PgC/month (an increase of
8%), and that the seasonal cycle of ecosystem CO$_2$ fluxes in the northern

not sufficient to reconstruct see-saw, a feature which we refer to as ``see-saw
degeneracy''. Indirect tests of see-saw are leptogenesis and lepton flavor
violation in supersymmetric scenarios, which together with neutrino mass and
mixing define the framework of see-saw phenomenology. Several examples are
given, both phenomenological and GUT-related. Variants of the see-saw mechanism
like the type II or triplet see-saw are also discussed. In particular, we
compare many general aspects regarding the dependence of LFV on low energy
neutrino parameters in the extreme cases of a dominating conventional see-saw
term or a dominating triplet term. For instance, the absence of mu -> e gamma
or tau -> e gamma in the pure triplet case means that CP is conserved in
neutrino oscillations. Scanning models, we also find that among the decays mu

meaning observers cannot wait until seeing conditions are optimal before taking
measurements, means that many ground-based solar flare observations are marred
with bad seeing. To combat this, we propose a method for dedicated flare seeing
correction based on training a deep neural network to learn to correct
artificial seeing from flare observations taken during good seeing conditions.
This model uses transfer learning, a novel technique in solar physics, to help
learn these corrections. Transfer learning is when another network already
trained on similar data is used to influence the learning of the new network.
Once trained, the model has been applied to two flare datasets: one from
AR12157 on 2014/09/06 and one from AR12673 on 2017/09/06. The results show good

highest total score wins the election. The cost of a candidate is his sum of
distances to all voters, and the distortion of an election is the ratio between
the cost of the elected candidate and the cost of the optimum candidate. We
consider the case when candidates are representative of the population, in the
sense that they are drawn i.i.d. from the population of the voters, and analyze
the expected distortion of positional voting rules.
  Our main result is a clean and tight characterization of positional voting
rules that have constant expected distortion (independent of the number of
candidates and the metric space). Our characterization result immediately
implies constant expected distortion for Borda Count and elections in which
each voter approves a constant fraction of all candidates. On the other hand,
we obtain super-constant expected distortion for Plurality, Veto, and approving
a constant number of candidates. These results contrast with previous results
on voting with metric preferences: When the candidates are chosen
adversarially, all of the preceding voting rules have distortion linear in the
number of candidates or voters. Thus, the model of representative candidates
allows us to distinguish voting rules which seem equally bad in the worst case.",1711.07600v1,cs.GT,2017-11-21 01:51:25+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Yu Cheng'), arxiv.Result.Author('Shaddin Dughmi'), arxiv.Result.Author('David Kempe')]",

23% and 77%, respectively, of the total sample. Most of the CC SNR candidates
are concentrated in the spiral arms, while the Type Ia SNR candidates are
rather distributed over the entire galaxy, including the inner region. The CC
SNR candidates are brighter in H$\alpha$ and [SII] than the Type Ia SNR
candidates. We derive a cumulative size distribution of the SNR candidates,
finding that the distribution of the candidates with 17 $< D <$ 50 pc is fitted
well by a power law with the power law index $\alpha = 2.53\pm0.04$. This
indicates that most of the SNR candidates identified in this study appear to be
in the Sedov-Taylor phase. The [SII]:H$\alpha$ distribution of the SNR
candidates is bimodal, with peaks at [SII]:H$\alpha$ $\sim$ 0.4 and $\sim$ 0.9.
The properties of these SNR candidates vary little with the galactocentric
distance. The H$\alpha$ and [SII] surface brightnesses show a good correlation
with the X-ray luminosity of the SNR candidates that are center-bright. The SNR
candidates with X-ray counterparts have higher surface brightnesses in
H$\alpha$ and [SII] and smaller sizes than those without such counterparts.",1403.4335v1,astro-ph.GA,2014-03-18 04:04:42+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Jong Hwan Lee'), arxiv.Result.Author('Myung Gyoon Lee')]",

for multidisorder diagnosis called symptom clustering. A symptom clustering
represents a set of candidates compactly as a cartesian product of differential
diagnoses. By evaluating the probability of a candidate set, then, a large set
of candidates can be validated or pruned simultaneously. The probability of a
candidate set is then specialized to obtain the probability of a single
candidate. Unlike earlier results, the equation derived here allows the
specification of positive, negative, and unknown symptoms and does not make
assumptions about disorders not in the candidate.",1304.1136v1,cs.AI,2013-03-27 13:59:43+00:00,[arxiv.Result.Author('Thomas D. Wu')],

544,Implementing and Evaluating Candidate-Based Invariant Generation,"The discovery of inductive invariants lies at the heart of static program
verification. Presently, many automatic solutions to inductive invariant
generation are inflexible, only applicable to certain classes of programs, or
unpredictable. An automatic technique that circumvents these deficiencies to
some extent is candidate-based invariant generation. This paper describes our
efforts to apply candidate-based invariant generation in GPUVerify, a static
checker for programs that run on GPUs. We study a set of GPU programs that
contain loops, drawn from a number of open source suites and vendor SDKs.
  We describe the methodology we used to incrementally improve the invariant
generation capabilities of GPUVerify to handle these benchmarks, through
candidate-based invariant generation, using cheap static analysis to speculate
potential program invariants. We also describe a set of experiments that we
used to examine the effectiveness of our rules for candidate generation,
assessing rules based on their generality (the extent to which they generate
candidate invariants), hit rate (the extent to which the generated candidates
hold), worth (the extent to which provable candidates actually help in allowing
verification to succeed), and influence (the extent to which the success of one
generation rule depends on candidates generated by another rule).
  The candidates produced by GPUVerify help to verify 231 of the 253 programs.
This increase in precision, however, makes GPUVerify sluggish: the more
candidates that are generated, the more time is spent determining which are
inductive invariants. To speed up this process, we have investigated four
under-approximating program analyses that aim to reject false candidates
quickly and a framework whereby these analyses can run in sequence or in
parallel.",1612.01198v2,cs.SE,2016-12-04 22:32:43+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Adam Betts'), arxiv.Result.Author('Nathan Chong'), arxiv.Result.Author('Pantazis Deligiannis'), arxiv.Result.Author('Alastair F. Donaldson'), arxiv.Result.Author('Jeroen Ketema')]",

systems are new detections and only one of the candidates is a known lens
system. For the most promising five systems including the known lens system, we
present results from preliminary lens mass modelling, which tests if the
candidates are plausible lens systems. Photometric redshifts of the candidate
lens galaxies are obtained from the COMBO-17 galaxy catalog. Stellar masses of
the candidate lens galaxies within the Einstein radius are obtained by using
the $z$-band luminosity and the $V-z$ color-based stellar mass-to-light ratios.
As expected, the lensing masses are found to be larger than the stellar masses
of the candidate lens galaxies. These candidates have similar dark matter
fractions as compared to lenses in SLACS and COSMOS. They also roughly follow
the halo mass-stellar mass relation predicted by the subhalo abundance matching
technique. One of the candidate lens galaxies qualifies as a LIRG and may not
be a true lens because the arc-like feature in the system is likely to be an
active region of star formation in the candidate lens galaxy. Amongst the five
best candidates, one is a confirmed lens system, one is a likely lens system,
two are less likely to be lenses and the status of one of the candidates is
ambiguous. Spectroscopic follow-up of these systems is still required to
confirm lensing and/or for more accurate determination of the lens masses and

approximate complete rankings (or how many candidates are required to achieve a
good approximation), or to develop systematic approaches to generate
high-quality candidates efficiently. In this paper, we seek to investigate
these questions via proposing a candidate generation and re-ranking based
framework (CIGAR), which first learns a preference-preserving binary embedding
for building a hash table to retrieve candidates, and then learns to re-rank
the candidates using real-valued ranking models with a candidate-oriented
objective. We perform a comprehensive study on several large-scale real-world
datasets consisting of millions of users/items and hundreds of millions of

three candidates, the problem is solved mainly by previous work. We mainly

552,One-Shot Neural Architecture Search via Self-Evaluated Template Network,"Neural architecture search (NAS) aims to automate the search procedure of
architecture instead of manual design. Even if recent NAS approaches finish the
search within days, lengthy training is still required for a specific
architecture candidate to get the parameters for its accurate evaluation.
Recently one-shot NAS methods are proposed to largely squeeze the tedious
training process by sharing parameters across candidates. In this way, the
parameters for each candidate can be directly extracted from the shared
parameters instead of training them from scratch. However, they have no sense
of which candidate will perform better until evaluation so that the candidates
to evaluate are randomly sampled and the top-1 candidate is considered the
best. In this paper, we propose a Self-Evaluated Template Network (SETN) to
improve the quality of the architecture candidates for evaluation so that it is
more likely to cover competitive candidates. SETN consists of two components:
(1) an evaluator, which learns to indicate the probability of each individual
architecture being likely to have a lower validation loss. The candidates for
evaluation can thus be selectively sampled according to this evaluator. (2) a
template network, which shares parameters among all candidates to amortize the
training cost of generated candidates. In experiments, the architecture found
by SETN achieves state-of-the-art performance on CIFAR and ImageNet benchmarks
within comparable computation costs. Code is publicly available on GitHub:

The cloned co-change candidates are usually created by reusing existing code

faint systems with sub-arcsecond separations between the lensing objects and
the lensed source images. Most of them are difficult objects for ground-based

Seven are ``strong lens'' candidates which appear to have multiple images of
the source. Three are cases where the single image of the source galaxy has
been significantly distorted into an arc. The first two quadruply lensed
candidates were reported in Ratnatunga et al 1995 (ApJL, 453, L5) We report on
the subsequent eight candidates and describe them with simple models based on
the assumption of singular isothermal potentials. Residuals from the simple

distortion: the quality of the chosen candidate as compared with the best
possible candidate. In this paper, we instead assume that a (very small) amount
of information is known about the voter preference strengths, not just about
their ordinal preferences. We provide mechanisms with much better distortion
when this extra information is known as compared to mechanisms which use only
ordinal information. We quantify tradeoffs between the amount of information
known about preference strengths and the achievable distortion. We further
provide advice about which type of information about preference strengths seems
to be the most useful. Finally, we conclude by quantifying the ideal candidate

One promising approach for understanding quality indicators is the use of the
optimal distribution of objective vectors that optimizes each quality
indicator. However, it is difficult to obtain the optimal distribution for each
quality indicator, especially when its theoretical property is unknown. Thus,
optimal distributions for most quality indicators have not been well
investigated. To address these issues, first, we propose a problem formulation
of finding the optimal distribution for each quality indicator on an arbitrary
Pareto front. Then, we approximate the optimal distributions for nine quality
indicators using the proposed problem formulation. We analyze the nine quality
indicators using their approximated optimal distributions on eight types of
Pareto fronts of three-objective problems. Our analysis demonstrates that
uniformly-distributed objective vectors over the entire Pareto front are not
optimal in many cases. Each quality indicator has its own optimal distribution

agents since voting is costly. Misbehaving agents always vote. We compare
conventional voting allowing for abstention with vote delegation. Preferences
of voters are private information and a positive outcome is achieved if
well-behaving agents win. We illustrate that vote delegation leads to quite
different outcomes than conventional voting with abstention. In particular, we
obtain three insights: First, if the number of misbehaving voters, denoted by f
, is high, both voting methods fail to deliver a positive outcome. Second, if f
takes an intermediate value, conventional voting delivers a positive outcome,
while vote delegation fails with probability one. Third, if f is low,
delegation delivers a positive outcome with higher probability than
conventional voting. Finally, our results characterize worst-case outcomes that

on the tournament graph (like Copeland) respectively. We argue that with an
elimination style voting rule like single transferable vote, partial voting
does not change the situations where strategic voting is possible. However,
with scoring rules and rules based on the tournament graph, partial voting can
increase the situations where strategic voting is possible. As a consequence,
the computational complexity of computing a strategic vote can change. For
example, with Borda count, the complexity of computing a strategic vote can
decrease or stay the same depending on how we score partial votes.",1405.7714v1,cs.GT,2014-05-28 12:13:52+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Nina Narodytska'), arxiv.Result.Author('Toby Walsh')]",

distributing trust to propose a smart contract-based protocol, namely, \proto.
There are many existing protocols for voting using smart contracts. We observe
that these either are not scalable or leak the vote tally during the voting
stage, i.e., do not provide vote concealment. In contrast, we show that FASTEN

winning alternative. Selection of a winner is accomplished via a voting rule,
e.g., rank-order voting, majority rule, plurality rule, approval voting. Which
voting rule should be used? In social choice theory, desirable properties of
voting rules are expressed as axioms to be satisfied. This thesis focuses on
axioms concerning strategic manipulation by voters. Sometimes, voters may
intentionally misstate their true preferences in order to alter the outcome for
their own advantage. For example, in plurality rule, if a voter knows that
their top-choice candidate will lose, then they might instead vote for their
second-choice candidate just to avoid an even less desirable result. When no
coalition of voters can strategically manipulate, then the voting rule is said
to satisfy the axiom of Strategy-Proofness. A less restrictive axiom is Weak
Strategy-Proofness (as defined by Dasgupta and Maskin (2019)), which allows for
strategic manipulation by all but the smallest coalitions. Under certain
intuitive conditions, Dasgupta and Maskin (2019) proved that the only voting
rules satisfying Strategy-Proofness are rank-order voting and majority rule. In
my thesis, I generalize their result, by proving that rank-order voting and
majority rule are surprisingly still the only voting rules satisfying Weak

It is well known that the US electoral college system is about 5 times more
likely to have a changed outcome due to vote corruption, when compared to a
majority vote. In fact, Mossel, O'Donnell and Oleszkiewicz proved in 2005 that
the majority voting method is most stable to this random vote corruption, among
voting methods where each person has a small influence on the election. We
discuss some recent progress on the analogous result for elections between more
than two candidates. In this case, plurality should be most stable to
corruption in votes. We also survey results on adversarial election

the votes and choosing the top-$k$ candidates receiving the most votes. An
agent may manipulate the vote to achieve a better outcome by voting in a way
that does not reflect their true preferences. In complex and uncertain
situations, agents may use heuristics to strategize, instead of incurring the
additional effort required to compute the manipulation which most favors them.
In this paper, we examine voting behavior in multi-winner approval voting
scenarios with complete information. We show that people generally manipulate

599,Vote Delegation and Misbehavior,"We study vote delegation with ""well-behaving"" and ""misbehaving"" agents and
compare it with conventional voting. Typical examples for vote delegation are
validation or governance tasks on blockchains. There is a majority of
well-behaving agents, but they may abstain or delegate their vote to other
agents since voting is costly. Misbehaving agents always vote. We compare
conventional voting allowing for abstention with vote delegation. Preferences
of voters are private information and a positive outcome is achieved if
well-behaving agents win. We illustrate that vote delegation leads to quite
different outcomes than conventional voting with abstention. In particular, we
obtain three insights: First, if the number of misbehaving voters, denoted by f
, is high, both voting methods fail to deliver a positive outcome. Second, if f
takes an intermediate value, conventional voting delivers a positive outcome,
while vote delegation fails with probability one. Third, if f is low,
delegation delivers a positive outcome with higher probability than
conventional voting. Finally, our results characterize worst-case outcomes that
can happen in a liquid democracy.",2102.08823v2,cs.GT,2021-02-17 15:32:32+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Hans Gersbach'), arxiv.Result.Author('Akaki Mamageishvili'), arxiv.Result.Author('Manvir Schneider')]",

power is based on their ability to influence the winning-ness of a coalition.
Usually each individual acts alone, casting either all or none of their votes

voting"" model to allow probabilistic voting, partial voting, and correlated
team voting. We extend the standard Banzhaf metric to account for these cases;
our generalization reduces to the standard metric under ""random voting"", This

601,The Computational Impact of Partial Votes on Strategic Voting,"In many real world elections, agents are not required to rank all candidates.
We study three of the most common methods used to modify voting rules to deal
with such partial votes. These methods modify scoring rules (like the Borda
count), elimination style rules (like single transferable vote) and rules based
on the tournament graph (like Copeland) respectively. We argue that with an
elimination style voting rule like single transferable vote, partial voting
does not change the situations where strategic voting is possible. However,
with scoring rules and rules based on the tournament graph, partial voting can
increase the situations where strategic voting is possible. As a consequence,
the computational complexity of computing a strategic vote can change. For
example, with Borda count, the complexity of computing a strategic vote can
decrease or stay the same depending on how we score partial votes.",1405.7714v1,cs.GT,2014-05-28 12:13:52+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Nina Narodytska'), arxiv.Result.Author('Toby Walsh')]",

electronic voting via electronic voting machines (EVMs) improves fairness by
relying on centralized trust. Homomorphic encryption-based voting protocols
also assure fairness but cannot scale to large scale elections such as
presidential elections. In this paper, we leverage the blockchain technology of
distributing trust to propose a smart contract-based protocol, namely, \proto.
There are many existing protocols for voting using smart contracts. We observe
that these either are not scalable or leak the vote tally during the voting
stage, i.e., do not provide vote concealment. In contrast, we show that FASTEN
preserves voter's privacy ensures vote concealment, immutability, and avoids
double voting. We prove that the probability of privacy breaches is negligibly
small. Further, our cost analysis of executing FASTEN over Ethereum is
comparable to most of the existing cost of elections.",2102.10594v1,cs.CR,2021-02-21 12:29:23+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Sankarshan Damle'), arxiv.Result.Author('Sujit Gujar'), arxiv.Result.Author('Moin Hussain Moti')]",
603,Exploring Weak Strategy-Proofness in Voting Theory,"Voting is the aggregation of individual preferences in order to select a
winning alternative. Selection of a winner is accomplished via a voting rule,
e.g., rank-order voting, majority rule, plurality rule, approval voting. Which
voting rule should be used? In social choice theory, desirable properties of
voting rules are expressed as axioms to be satisfied. This thesis focuses on
axioms concerning strategic manipulation by voters. Sometimes, voters may
intentionally misstate their true preferences in order to alter the outcome for
their own advantage. For example, in plurality rule, if a voter knows that
their top-choice candidate will lose, then they might instead vote for their
second-choice candidate just to avoid an even less desirable result. When no
coalition of voters can strategically manipulate, then the voting rule is said
to satisfy the axiom of Strategy-Proofness. A less restrictive axiom is Weak
Strategy-Proofness (as defined by Dasgupta and Maskin (2019)), which allows for
strategic manipulation by all but the smallest coalitions. Under certain
intuitive conditions, Dasgupta and Maskin (2019) proved that the only voting
rules satisfying Strategy-Proofness are rank-order voting and majority rule. In
my thesis, I generalize their result, by proving that rank-order voting and
majority rule are surprisingly still the only voting rules satisfying Weak
Strategy-Proofness.",2005.07521v1,econ.TH,2020-05-13 19:53:08+00:00,[arxiv.Result.Author('Anne Carlstein')],

interference by third parties. For example, suppose votes have been cast in an
election between two candidates, and then each vote is randomly changed with a
small probability, independently of the other votes. It is desirable to keep
the outcome of the election the same, regardless of the changes to the votes.
It is well known that the US electoral college system is about 5 times more
likely to have a changed outcome due to vote corruption, when compared to a
majority vote. In fact, Mossel, O'Donnell and Oleszkiewicz proved in 2005 that
the majority voting method is most stable to this random vote corruption, among
voting methods where each person has a small influence on the election. We
discuss some recent progress on the analogous result for elections between more
than two candidates. In this case, plurality should be most stable to
corruption in votes. We also survey results on adversarial election
manipulation (where an adversary can select particular votes to change, perhaps
in a non-random way), and we briefly discuss ranked choice voting methods

votes across the network by updating the states of interacting nodes using two
key operations, the union and the intersection. The proposed algorithm is
simple, independent from network size, and easily scalable in terms of the
number of choices $K$, using only $K\times 2^{K-1}$ nodal states for voting,
and $K\times K!$ nodal states for ranking. We prove the number of states to be
optimal in the ranking case, this optimality is conjectured to also apply to

the second round, after the results of the first round have been published, the
remaining citizens decide whether to vote for one alternative or to ab- stain.
The votes from both rounds are aggregated, and the final outcome is obtained by
applying the majority rule, with ties being broken by fair randomization.
Within a costly voting framework, we show that large elec- torates will choose
the preferred alternative of the majority with high prob- ability, and that
average costs will be low. This result is in contrast with the literature on

Moreover, scenarios such as committee or board elections require voting rules

the votes and choosing the top-$k$ candidates receiving the most votes. An
agent may manipulate the vote to achieve a better outcome by voting in a way
that does not reflect their true preferences. In complex and uncertain
situations, agents may use heuristics to strategize, instead of incurring the
additional effort required to compute the manipulation which most favors them.
In this paper, we examine voting behavior in multi-winner approval voting
scenarios with complete information. We show that people generally manipulate
their vote to obtain a better outcome, but often do not identify the optimal
manipulation. Instead, voters tend to prioritize the candidates with the
highest utilities. Using simulations, we demonstrate the effectiveness of these

control scenarios. To protect elections from such control attempts,
computational complexity has been used to show that electoral control, though
not impossible, is computationally prohibitive. Among natural voting systems

of proven resistances to control types (namely 19 out of 22) are
""sincere-strategy preference-based approval voting"" (SP-AV, a modification of a
system proposed by Brams and Sanver) and fallback voting. Both are hybrid
systems; e.g., fallback voting combines approval with Bucklin voting. In this

functions, there exists a quantum zero-knowledge proof system for NP in the
bounded concurrent setting. In this setting, we fix a priori the number of
verifiers that can simultaneously interact with the prover. Under the same
assumption, we also show that there exists a quantum zero-knowledge proof
system for QMA in the bounded concurrency setting.

errors (QLWE), there exists a bounded concurrent zero-knowledge proof system
for NP satisfying quantum proof of knowledge property. Our extraction mechanism
simultaneously allows for extraction probability to be negligibly close to
acceptance probability (extractability) and also ensures that the prover's
state after extraction is statistically close to the prover's state after
interacting with the verifier (simulatability). The seminal work of [Unruh

626,Certified Everlasting Zero-Knowledge Proof for QMA,"In known constructions of classical zero-knowledge protocols for NP, either
of zero-knowledge or soundness holds only against computationally bounded
adversaries. Indeed, achieving both statistical zero-knowledge and statistical
soundness at the same time with classical verifier is impossible for NP unless
the polynomial-time hierarchy collapses, and it is also believed to be
impossible even with a quantum verifier. In this work, we introduce a novel
compromise, which we call the certified everlasting zero-knowledge proof for
QMA. It is a computational zero-knowledge proof for QMA, but the verifier
issues a classical certificate that shows that the verifier has deleted its
quantum information. If the certificate is valid, even unbounded malicious
verifier can no longer learn anything beyond the validity of the statement. We
construct a certified everlasting zero-knowledge proof for QMA. For the
construction, we introduce a new quantum cryptographic primitive, which we call
commitment with statistical binding and certified everlasting hiding, where the
hiding property becomes statistical once the receiver has issued a valid
certificate that shows that the receiver has deleted the committed information.
We construct commitment with statistical binding and certified everlasting
hiding from quantum encryption with certified deletion by Broadbent and Islam
[TCC 2020] (in a black box way), and then combine it with the quantum
sigma-protocol for QMA by Broadbent and Grilo [FOCS 2020] to construct the

627,Analysis of Quantum Multi-Prover Zero-Knowledge Systems: Elimination of the Honest Condition and Computational Zero-Knowledge Systems for QMIP*,"Zero-knowledge and multi-prover systems are both central notions in classical
and quantum complexity theory. There is, however, little research in quantum
multi-prover zero-knowledge systems. This paper studies complexity-theoretical
aspects of the quantum multi-prover zero-knowledge systems. This paper has two
results:
  1.QMIP* systems with honest zero-knowledge can be converted into general
zero-knowledge systems without any assumptions.
  2.QMIP* has computational quantum zero-knowledge systems if a natural
computational conjecture holds.
  One of the main tools is a test (called the GHZ test) that uses GHZ states
shared by the provers, which prevents the verifier's attack in the above two
results. Another main tool is what we call the Local Hamiltonian based
Interactive protocol (LHI protocol). The LHI protocol makes previous research
for Local Hamiltonians applicable to check the history state of interactive
proofs, and we then apply Broadbent et al.'s zero-knowledge protocol for QMA

complete problem. Our results may be the first non-trivial quantum
zero-knowledge proofs secure even against dishonest quantum verifiers, since
our protocols are non-interactive, and thus the zero-knowledge property does

rates, data protection and concealment increases its importance as a field of
scientific study that requires more effort. It is essential to protect critical

tool that is of interest and can be widely used in this medium is
zero-knowledge proof systems. This cryptographic structure allows one party to

635,A Zero Knowledge Sumcheck and its Applications,"Many seminal results in Interactive Proofs (IPs) use algebraic techniques
based on low-degree polynomials, the study of which is pervasive in theoretical
computer science. Unfortunately, known methods for endowing such proofs with
zero knowledge guarantees do not retain this rich algebraic structure.
  In this work, we develop algebraic techniques for obtaining zero knowledge
variants of proof protocols in a way that leverages and preserves their
algebraic structure. Our constructions achieve unconditional (perfect) zero
knowledge in the Interactive Probabilistically Checkable Proof (IPCP) model of
Kalai and Raz [KR08] (the prover first sends a PCP oracle, then the prover and
verifier engage in an Interactive Proof in which the verifier may query the
PCP).
  Our main result is a zero knowledge variant of the sumcheck protocol [LFKN92]
in the IPCP model. The sumcheck protocol is a key building block in many IPs,
including the protocol for polynomial-space computation due to Shamir [Sha92],
and the protocol for parallel computation due to Goldwasser, Kalai, and
Rothblum [GKR15]. A core component of our result is an algebraic commitment
scheme, whose hiding property is guaranteed by algebraic query complexity lower
bounds [AW09,JKRS09]. This commitment scheme can then be used to considerably
strengthen our previous work [BCFGRS16] that gives a sumcheck protocol with
much weaker zero knowledge guarantees, itself using algebraic techniques based
on algorithms for polynomial identity testing [RS05,BW04].
  We demonstrate the applicability of our techniques by deriving zero knowledge
variants of well-known protocols based on algebraic techniques, including the
protocols of Shamir and of Goldwasser, Kalai, and Rothblum, as well as the

640,A Survey on Zero Knowledge Range Proofs and Applications,"In last years, there has been an increasing effort to leverage Distributed
Ledger Technology (DLT), including blockchain. One of the main topics of
interest, given its importance, is the research and development of privacy
mechanisms, as for example is the case of Zero Knowledge Proofs (ZKP). ZKP is a
cryptographic technique that can be used to hide information that is put into
the ledger, while still allowing to perform validation of this data. In this
work we describe different strategies to construct Zero Knowledge Range Proofs
(ZKRP), as for example the scheme proposed by Boudot in 2001; the one proposed
in 2008 by Camenisch et al, and Bulletproofs, proposed in 2017. We also compare
these strategies and discuss possible use cases. Since Bulletproofs is the most
efficient construction, we will give a detailed description of its algorithms
and optimizations. Bulletproofs is not only more efficient than previous
schemes, but also avoids the trusted setup, which is a requirement that is not
desirable in the context of Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) and blockchain.
In case of cryptocurrencies, if the setup phase is compromised, it would be
possible to generate money out of thin air. Interestingly, Bulletproofs can
also be used to construct generic Zero Knowledge Proofs (ZKP), in the sense
that it can be used to prove generic statements, and thus it is not only
restricted to ZKRP, but it can be used for any kind of Proof of Knowledge
(PoK). Hence Bulletproofs leads to a more powerful tool to provide privacy for
DLT. Here we describe in detail the algorithms involved in Bulletproofs

642,"On How Zero-Knowledge Proof Blockchain Mixers Improve, and Worsen User Privacy","One of the most prominent and widely-used blockchain privacy solutions are
zero-knowledge proof (ZKP) mixers operating on top of smart contract-enabled
blockchains. ZKP mixers typically advertise their level of privacy through a
so-called anonymity set size, similar to k-anonymity, where a user hides among
a set of $k$ other users.
  In reality, however, these anonymity set claims are mostly inaccurate, as we
find through empirical measurements of the currently most active ZKP mixers. We
propose five heuristics that, in combination, can increase the probability that
an adversary links a withdrawer to the correct depositor on average by 51.94%
(108.63%) on the most popular Ethereum (ETH) and Binance Smart Chain (BSC)
mixer, respectively. Our empirical evidence is hence also the first to suggest
a differing privacy-predilection of users on ETH and BSC. We further identify
105 Decentralized Finance (DeFi) attackers leveraging ZKP mixers as the initial
funds and to deposit attack revenue (e.g., from phishing scams, hacking
centralized exchanges, and blockchain project attacks).
  State-of-the-art mixers are moreover tightly intertwined with the growing
DeFi ecosystem by offering ``anonymity mining'' (AM) incentives, i.e., mixer
users receive monetary rewards for mixing coins. However, contrary to the
claims of related work, we find that AM does not always contribute to improving
the quality of an anonymity set size of a mixer, because AM tends to attract
privacy-ignorant users naively reusing addresses.",2201.09035v1,cs.CR,2022-01-22 12:20:50+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Zhipeng Wang'), arxiv.Result.Author('Stefanos Chaliasos'), arxiv.Result.Author('Kaihua Qin'), arxiv.Result.Author('Liyi Zhou'), arxiv.Result.Author('Lifeng Gao'), arxiv.Result.Author('Pascal Berrang'), arxiv.Result.Author('Ben Livshits'), arxiv.Result.Author('Arthur Gervais')]",

identical copies of some cards, making it impractical as a deck of playing
cards found in everyday life typically consists of all different cards. In this
paper, we propose a new ZKP protocol for Makaro that can be implemented using a
standard deck (a deck consisting of all different cards). Our protocol also
uses asymptotically less cards than the protocol of Bultel et al. Most

protocols. This is done while protecting participation privacy from a remote
observer - one who does not physically observe voters during voting. Our
protocol can be instantiated as an additional layer on top of most existing
pollsite E2E-V voting protocols. To achieve our guarantees, we develop an
efficient zero-knowledge proof (ZKP), that, given a value $v$ and a set $\Phi$

between blockchains. This interoperability promotes innovation, unlocks
liquidity and access to assets. However, blockchains are isolated systems that
originally were not designed for interoperability. This makes cross-chain
communication, or bridges for short, insecure by nature. More precisely,
cross-chain systems face security challenges in terms of selfish rational
players such as maximal extractable value (MEV) and censorship.
  We propose to solve these challenges using zero knowledge proofs (ZKPs) for
cross-chain communication. Securing cross-chain communication is remarkably
more complex than securing single-chain events as such a system must preserve
user security against both on- and off-chain analysis.
  To achieve this goal, we propose the following pair of contributions: the
DACT protocol and the SurferMonkey infrastructure that supports the DACT
protocol. The DACT protocol is a global solution for the anonymity and security
challenges of agnostic blockchain intercommunication. DACT breaks on- and
off-chain analysis thanks to the use of ZKPs. SurferMonkey is a decentralized
infrastructure that implements DACT in practice. Since SurferMonkey works at
the blockchain application layer, any decentralized application (dApp) can use
SurferMonkey to send any type of message to a dApp on another blockchain. With
SurferMonkey, users can neither be censored nor be exposed to MEV. By applying
decentralized proactive security, we obtain resilience against selfish rational
players, and raise the security bar against cyberattacks. We have implemented a
proof of concept (PoC) of SurferMonkey by reverse engineering Tornado Cash and
by applying IDEN3 ZKP circuits. SurferMonkey enables new usecases, ranging from
anonymous voting and gaming, to a new phase of anonymous decentralized finance

a Zero-Knowledge Proof (ZKP) algorithm based on isomorphic graphs. We suggest
most of the computations should be carried out on the users' web browser
without revealing the password to the server at any point in time. Instead, it
will generate random graphs and their permutations based on the login ID and
password.",1911.09329v1,cs.CR,2019-11-21 08:13:47+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Lavish Saluja'), arxiv.Result.Author('Ashutosh Bhatia')]",
651,Towards Verifiable Differentially-Private Polling,"Analyses that fulfill differential privacy provide plausible deniability to
individuals while allowing analysts to extract insights from data. However,
beyond an often acceptable accuracy tradeoff, these statistical disclosure
techniques generally inhibit the verifiability of the provided information, as
one cannot check the correctness of the participants' truthful information, the
differentially private mechanism, or the unbiased random number generation.
While related work has already discussed this opportunity, an efficient
implementation with a precise bound on errors and corresponding proofs of the
differential privacy property is so far missing. In this paper, we follow an
approach based on zero-knowledge proofs~(ZKPs), in specific succinct
non-interactive arguments of knowledge, as a verifiable computation technique
to prove the correctness of a differentially private query output. In
particular, we ensure the guarantees of differential privacy hold despite the
limitations of ZKPs that operate on finite fields and have limited branching
capabilities. We demonstrate that our approach has practical performance and
discuss how practitioners could employ our primitives to verifiably query
individuals' age from their digitally signed ID card in a differentially
private manner.",2206.07220v1,cs.CR,2022-06-15 00:26:59+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Gonzalo Munilla Garrido'), arxiv.Result.Author('Matthias Babel'), arxiv.Result.Author('Johannes Sedlmeir')]",
652,00,"What is the funniest number in cryptography (Episode 2)? 0 [1]. The reason is
that $\forall x, x \cdot 0 = 0$, i.e., the equation is satisfied no matter what
$x$ is. We'll use zero to attack zero-knowledge proof (ZKP). In particular,
we'll discuss a critical issue in a cutting-edge ZKP PLONK [2] C++
implementation which allows an attacker to create a forged proof that all
verifiers will accept. We'll show how theory guides the attack's direction. In
practice, the attack works like a charm and we'll show how the attack falls
through a chain of perfectly aligned software cracks. In the same codebase,
there is an independent critical ECDSA bug where (r, s) = (0, 0) is a valid
signature for arbitrary keys and messages, but we won't discuss it further
because it's a known ECDSA attack vector in the Google Wycheproof cryptanalysis
project [3] that I worked on a few years ago.

653,Post-Quantum Cryptographic Hardware Primitives,"The development and implementation of post-quantum cryptosystems have become
a pressing issue in the design of secure computing systems, as general quantum
computers have become more feasible in the last two years. In this work, we
introduce a set of hardware post-quantum cryptographic primitives (PCPs)
consisting of four frequently used security components, i.e., public-key
cryptosystem (PKC), key exchange (KEX), oblivious transfer (OT), and
zero-knowledge proof (ZKP). In addition, we design a high speed polynomial
multiplier to accelerate these primitives. These primitives will aid
researchers and designers in constructing quantum-proof secure computing
systems in the post-quantum era.",1903.03735v1,cs.CR,2019-03-09 04:45:43+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Lake Bu'), arxiv.Result.Author('Rashmi Agrawal'), arxiv.Result.Author('Hai Cheng'), arxiv.Result.Author('Michel A. Kinsy')]",
654,BAN-GZKP: Optimal Zero Knowledge Proof based Scheme for Wireless Body Area Networks,"BANZKP is the best to date Zero Knowledge Proof (ZKP) based secure
lightweight and energy efficient authentication scheme designed for Wireless
Area Network (WBAN). It is vulnerable to several security attacks such as the
replay attack, Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks at sink and
redundancy information crack. However, BANZKP needs an end-to-end
authentication which is not compliant with the human body postural mobility. We
propose a new scheme BAN-GZKP. Our scheme improves both the security and
postural mobility resilience of BANZKP. Moreover, BAN-GZKP uses only a
three-phase authentication which is optimal in the class of ZKP protocols. To
fix the security vulnerabilities of BANZKP, BAN-GZKP uses a novel random key
allocation and a Hop-by-Hop authentication definition. We further prove the
reliability of our scheme to various attacks including those to which BANZKP is
vulnerable. Furthermore, via extensive simulations we prove that our scheme,
BAN-GZKP, outperforms BANZKP in terms of reliability to human body postural
mobility for various network parameters (end-to-end delay, number of packets
exchanged in the network, number of transmissions). We compared both schemes
using representative convergecast strategies with various transmission rates
and human postural mobility. Finally, it is important to mention that BAN-GZKP
has no additional cost compared to BANZKP in terms memory, computational
complexity or energy consumption.",1802.07023v1,cs.NI,2018-02-20 09:19:11+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Gewu Bu'), arxiv.Result.Author('Maria Potop-Butucaru')]",
655,SANS: Self-sovereign Authentication for Network Slices,"5G communications proposed significant improvements over 4G in terms of
efficiency and security. Among these novelties, the 5G Network Slicing seems to
have a prominent role: deploy multiple virtual network slices, each providing a
different service with different needs and features. Like this, a Slice
Operator (SO) ruling a specific slice may want to offer a service for users
meeting some requirements. It is of paramount importance to provide a robust
authentication protocol, able to ensure that users meet the requirements, but
providing at the same time a privacy-by-design architecture. This makes even
more sense having a growing density of Internet of Things (IoT) devices
exchanging private information over the network. In this paper, we improve the
5G network slicing authentication using a Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) scheme:
granting users full control over their data. We introduce an approach to allow
a user to prove his right to access a specific service without leaking any
information about him. Such an approach is SANS, a protocol that provides
non-linkable protection for any issued information, preventing an SO or an
eavesdropper from tracking users' activity and relating it with their real
identities. Furthermore, our protocol is scalable and can be taken as a
framework for improving related technologies in similar scenarios, like
authentication in the 5G Radio Access Network (RAN) or other wireless networks
and services. Such features can be achieved using cryptographic primitives
called Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKP). Upon implementing our solution using a
state-of-the-art ZKP library and performing several experiments, we provide
benchmarks demonstrating that our approach is affordable in speed and memory
consumption.",2010.15867v1,cs.CR,2020-10-29 18:12:43+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Xavier Salleras'), arxiv.Result.Author('Vanesa Daza')]",
