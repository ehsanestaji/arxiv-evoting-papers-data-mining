0,Explicit Auditing,"The Calculus of Audited Units (CAU) is a typed lambda calculus resulting from
a computational interpretation of Artemov's Justification Logic under the
Curry-Howard isomorphism; it extends the simply typed lambda calculus by
providing audited types, inhabited by expressions carrying a trail of their
past computation history. Unlike most other auditing techniques, CAU allows the
inspection of trails at runtime as a first-class operation, with applications
in security, debugging, and transparency of scientific computation.
  An efficient implementation of CAU is challenging: not only do the sizes of
trails grow rapidly, but they also need to be normalized after every beta
reduction. In this paper, we study how to reduce terms more efficiently in an
untyped variant of CAU by means of explicit substitutions and explicit auditing
operations, finally deriving a call-by-value abstract machine.",1808.00486v1,cs.LO,2018-08-01 18:03:02+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Wilmer Ricciotti'), arxiv.Result.Author('James Cheney')]",
1,Towards Privacy-assured and Lightweight On-chain Auditing of Decentralized Storage,"How to audit outsourced data in centralized storage like cloud is
well-studied, but it is largely under-explored for the rising decentralized
storage network (DSN) that bodes well for a billion-dollar market. To realize
DSN as a usable service in a truly decentralized manner, the blockchain comes
in handy -- to record and verify audit trails in forms of proof of storage, and
based on that, to handle fair payments with necessary dispute resolution.
  Leaving the audit trails on the blockchain offers transparency and fairness,
yet it 1) sacrifices privacy, as they may leak information about the data under
audit, and 2) overwhelms on-chain resources, as they may be practically large
in size and expensive to verify. Prior auditing designs in centralized settings
are not directly applicable here. A handful of proposals targeting DSN cannot
satisfactorily address these issues either.
  We present an auditing solution that addresses on-chain privacy and
efficiency, from a synergy of homomorphic linear authenticators with polynomial
commitments for succinct proofs, and the sigma protocol for provable privacy.
The solution results in, per audit, 288-byte proof written to the blockchain,
and constant verification cost. It can sustain long-term operation and easily
scale to thousands of users on Ethereum.",2005.05531v3,cs.CR,2020-05-12 03:14:09+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Yuefeng Du'), arxiv.Result.Author('Huayi Duan'), arxiv.Result.Author('Anxin Zhou'), arxiv.Result.Author('Cong Wang'), arxiv.Result.Author('Man Ho Au'), arxiv.Result.Author('Qian Wang')]",

4,Reversibility and Composition of Rewriting in Hierarchies,"In this paper, we study how graph transformations based on sesqui-pushout
rewriting can be reversed and how the composition of rewrites can be
constructed. We illustrate how such reversibility and composition can be used
to design an audit trail system for individual graphs and graph hierarchies.
This provides us with a compact way to maintain the history of updates of an
object, including its multiple versions. The main application of the designed
framework is an audit trail of updates to knowledge represented by hierarchies
of graphs. Therefore, we introduce the notion of rule hierarchy that represents
a transformation of the entire hierarchy, study how rule hierarchies can be
applied to hierarchies and analyse the conditions under which this application
is reversible. We then present a theory for constructing the composition of
consecutive hierarchy rewrites. The prototype audit trail system for
transformations in hierarchies of simple graphs with attributes is implemented
as part of the ReGraph Python library.",2012.01661v1,cs.LO,2020-12-03 02:29:28+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Russ Harmer'), arxiv.Result.Author('Eugenia Oshurko')]","EPTCS 330, 2020, pp. 145-162"

7,Auditing Indian Elections,"Indian Electronic Voting Machines (EVMs) will be fitted with printers that
produce Voter-Verifiable Paper Audit Trails (VVPATs) in time for the 2019
general election. VVPATs provide evidence that each vote was recorded as the
voter intended, without having to trust the perfection or security of the EVMs.
  However, confidence in election results requires more: VVPATs must be
preserved inviolate and then actually used to check the reported election
result in a trustworthy way that the public can verify. A full manual tally
from the VVPATs could be prohibitively expensive and time-consuming; moreover,
it is difficult for the public to determine whether a full hand count was
conducted accurately. We show how Risk-Limiting Audits (RLAs) could provide
high confidence in Indian election results. Compared to full hand recounts,
RLAs typically require manually inspecting far fewer VVPATs when the outcome is
correct, and are much easier for the electorate to observe in adequate detail

9,Effcient logging and querying for Blockchain-based cross-site genomic dataset access audit,"Background: Genomic data have been collected by different institutions and
companies and need to be shared for broader use. In a cross-site genomic data
sharing system, a secure and transparent access control audit module plays an
essential role in ensuring the accountability. The 2018 iDASH competition first
track provides us with an opportunity to design efficient logging and querying
system for cross-site genomic dataset access audit. We designed a
blockchain-based log system which can provide a light-weight and widely
compatible module for existing blockchain platforms. The submitted solution won
the third place of the competition. In this paper, we report the technical
details in our system. Methods: We present two methods: baseline method and
enhanced method. We started with the baseline method and then adjusted our
implementation based on the competition evaluation criteria and characteristics
of the log system. To overcome obstacles of indexing on the immutable
Blockchain system, we designed a hierarchical timestamp structure which
supports efficient range queries on the timestamp field. Results: We
implemented our methods in Python3, tested the scalability, and compared the
performance using the test data supplied by competition organizer. We
successfully boosted the log retrieval speed for complex AND queries that
contain multiple predicates. For the range query, we boosted the speed for at
least one order of magnitude. The storage usage is reduced by 25%. Conclusion:
We demonstrate that Blockchain can be used to build a time and space efficient

14,Safe Artificial General Intelligence via Distributed Ledger Technology,"Background. Expert observers and artificial intelligence (AI) progression
metrics indicate AI will exceed human intelligence within a few decades.
Whether general AI that exceeds human capabilities (AGI) will be the single
greatest boon in history or a disaster is unknown. No proofs exist that AGI
will benefit humans or that AGI will not harm or eliminate humans.
  Objective. I propose a set of logically distinct conceptual components that
are necessary and sufficient to 1) ensure that most known AGI scenarios will
not harm humanity and 2) robustly align AGI values and goals with human values.
  Methods. By systematically addressing each pathway category to malevolent AI
we can induce the methods/axioms required to redress the category.
  Results and Discussion. Distributed ledger technology (DLT, blockchain) is
integral to this proposal, e.g. to reduce the probability of hacking, provide
an audit trail to detect and correct errors or identify components causing
vulnerability or failure and replace them or shut them down remotely and/or
automatically, and to separate and balance key AGI components via decentralized
apps (dApps). Smart contracts based on DLT are necessary to address evolution
of AI that will be too fast for human monitoring and intervention.
  The proposed axioms. 1) Access to technology by market license. 2)
Transparent ethics embodied in DLT. 3) Morality encrypted via DLT. 4) Behavior
control structure with values (ethics) at roots. 5) Individual bar-code
identification of all critical components. 6) Configuration Item (from business
continuity/disaster recovery planning). 7) Identity verification secured via
DLT. 8) Smart automated contracts based on DLT. 9) Decentralized applications -

full audit trail for such processes as recognition, reasoning, analysis of
language, and so on. There is also an explicit audit trail for the unsupervised
learning of new knowledge; 2) knowledge from the system is likely to be
granular and easy for people to understand; and 3) there are seven principles
for the organisation of knowledge which are central in the workings of the SP
System and also very familiar to people (eg chunking-with-codes, part-whole

16,The Minimum Hybrid Contract (MHC): Combining legal and blockchain smart contracts,"Corruption is a major global financial problem with billions of dollars

  Smart contracts have emerged in recent years and appear promising for
applications such as legal contracts where transparency is critical and of
public interest. Transparency and auditability are inherent because smart
contracts execute operations on the blockchain, a distributed public ledger.
  In this paper, we propose the Minimum Hybrid Contract (MHC), with the aim of
introducing 1) auditability, 2) transparency, and 3) immutability to the
contract's financial transactions. The MHC comprises an online smart contract
and an offline traditional legal contract. where the two are immutably linked.

18,SOBA: Secrecy-preserving Observable Ballot-level Audit,"SOBA is an approach to election verification that provides observers with
justifiably high confidence that the reported results of an election are
consistent with an audit trail (""ballots""), which can be paper or electronic.
SOBA combines three ideas: (1) publishing cast vote records (CVRs) separately
for each contest, so that anyone can verify that each reported contest outcome
is correct, if the CVRs reflect voters' intentions with sufficient accuracy;
(2) shrouding a mapping between ballots and the CVRs for those ballots to
prevent the loss of privacy that could occur otherwise; (3) assessing the
accuracy with which the CVRs reflect voters' intentions for a collection of
contests while simultaneously assessing the integrity of the shrouded mapping
between ballots and CVRs by comparing randomly selected ballots to the CVRs
that purport to represent them. Step (1) is related to work by the Humboldt
County Election Transparency Project, but publishing CVRs separately for
individual contests rather than images of entire ballots preserves privacy.
Step (2) requires a cryptographic commitment from elections officials.
Observers participate in step (3), which relies on the ""super-simple
simultaneous single-ballot risk-limiting audit."" Step (3) is designed to reveal
relatively few ballots if the shrouded mapping is proper and the CVRs
accurately reflect voter intent. But if the reported outcomes of the contests
differ from the outcomes that a full hand count would show, step (3) is
guaranteed to have a large chance of requiring all the ballots to be counted by
hand, thereby limiting the risk that an incorrect outcome will become official

19,Non(c)esuch Ballot-Level Risk-Limiting Audits for Precinct-Count Voting Systems,"Risk-limiting audits (RLAs) guarantee a high probability of correcting
incorrect reported outcomes before the outcomes are certified. The most
efficient use ballot-level comparison, comparing the voting system's
interpretation of individual ballot cards sampled at random (cast-vote records,
CVRs) from a trustworthy paper trail to a human interpretation of the same
cards. Such comparisons require the voting system to create and export CVRs in
a way that can be linked to the individual ballots the CVRs purport to
represent. Such links can be created by keeping the ballots in the order in
which they are scanned or by printing a unique serial number on each ballot.
But for precinct-count systems (PCOS), these strategies may compromise vote
anonymity: the order in which ballots are cast may identify the voters who cast
them. Printing a unique pseudo-random number (""cryptographic nonce"") on each
ballot card after the voter last touches it could reduce such privacy risks.
But what if the system does not in fact print a unique number on each ballot or
does not accurately report the numbers it printed? This paper gives two ways to
conduct an RLA so that even if the system does not print a genuine nonce on
each ballot or misreports the nonces it used, the audit's risk limit is not
compromised (however, the anonymity of votes might be compromised). One method
allows untrusted technology to be used to imprint and to retrieve ballot cards.
The method is adaptive: if the technology behaves properly, this protection
does not increase the audit workload. But if the imprinting or retrieval system
misbehaves, the sample size the RLA requires to confirm the reported results
when the results are correct is generally larger than if the imprinting and
retrieval were accurate.",2207.01362v1,cs.CR,2022-07-04 12:35:42+00:00,[arxiv.Result.Author('Philip B. Stark')],

21,"Algorithmic audits of algorithms, and the law","Algorithmic decision making is now widespread, ranging from health care
allocation to more common actions such as recommendation or information
ranking. The aim to audit these algorithms has grown alongside. In this paper,
we focus on external audits that are conducted by interacting with the user
side of the target algorithm, hence considered as a black box. Yet, the legal
framework in which these audits take place is mostly ambiguous to researchers
developing them: on the one hand, the legal value of the audit outcome is
uncertain; on the other hand the auditors' rights and obligations are unclear.
The contribution of this paper is to articulate two canonical audit forms to
law, to shed light on these aspects: 1) the first audit form (we coin the Bobby
audit form) checks a predicate against the algorithm, while the second
(Sherlock) is more loose and opens up to multiple investigations. We find that:
Bobby audits are more amenable to prosecution, yet are delicate as operating on
real user data. This can lead to reject by a court (notion of admissibility).
Sherlock audits craft data for their operation, most notably to build
surrogates of the audited algorithm. It is mostly used for acts for
whistleblowing, as even if accepted as a proof, the evidential value will be
low in practice. 2) these two forms require the prior respect of a proper right
to audit, granted by law or by the platform being audited; otherwise the
auditor will be also prone to prosecutions regardless of the audit outcome.
This article thus highlights the relation of current audits with law, in order
to structure the growing field of algorithm auditing.",2203.03711v1,cs.CY,2022-02-15 14:20:53+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Erwan Le Merrer'), arxiv.Result.Author('Ronan Pons'), arxiv.Result.Author('Gilles Trédan')]",

24,Auditable Restoration of Distributed Programs,"We focus on a protocol for auditable restoration of distributed systems. The
need for such protocol arises due to conflicting requirements (e.g., access to
the system should be restricted but emergency access should be provided). One
can design such systems with a tamper detection approach (based on the
intuition of ""break the glass door""). However, in a distributed system, such
tampering, which are denoted as auditable events, is visible only for a single
node. This is unacceptable since the actions they take in these situations can
be different than those in the normal mode. Moreover, eventually, the auditable
event needs to be cleared so that system resumes the normal operation.
  With this motivation, in this paper, we present a protocol for auditable
restoration, where any process can potentially identify an auditable event.
Whenever a new auditable event occurs, the system must reach an ""auditable
state"" where every process is aware of the auditable event. Only after the
system reaches an auditable state, it can begin the operation of restoration.
Although any process can observe an auditable event, we require that only
""authorized"" processes can begin the task of restoration. Moreover, these
processes can begin the restoration only when the system is in an auditable
state. Our protocol is self-stabilizing and has bounded state space. It can
effectively handle the case where faults or auditable events occur during the
restoration protocol. Moreover, it can be used to provide auditable restoration
to other distributed protocol.",1506.07957v1,cs.DC,2015-06-26 04:52:24+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Reza Hajisheykhi'), arxiv.Result.Author('Mohammad Roohitavaf'), arxiv.Result.Author('Sandeep Kulkarni')]",

30,Bayesian Tabulation Audits: Explained and Extended,"Tabulation audits for an election provide statistical evidence that a
reported contest outcome is ""correct"" (meaning that the tabulation of votes was
properly performed), or else the tabulation audit determines the correct
outcome.
  Stark proposed risk-limiting tabulation audits for this purpose; such audits
are effective and are beginning to be used in practice.
  We expand the study of election audits based on Bayesian methods, first
introduced by Rivest and Shen in 2012. (The risk-limiting audits proposed by
Stark are ""frequentist"" rather than Bayesian in character.)
  We first provide a simplified presentation of Bayesian tabulation audits. A
Bayesian tabulation audit begins by drawing a random sample of the votes in
that contest, and tallying those votes. It then considers what effect
statistical variations of this tally have on the contest outcome. If such
variations almost always yield the previously-reported outcome, the audit
terminates, accepting the reported outcome. Otherwise the audit is repeated
with an enlarged sample.
  Bayesian audits are attractive because they work with any method for
determining the winner (such as ranked-choice voting).
  We then show how Bayesian audits may be extended to handle more complex
situations, such as auditing contests that \emph{span multiple jurisdictions},
or are otherwise ""stratified.""
  We highlight the auditing of such multiple-jurisdiction contests where some
of the jurisdictions have an electronic cast vote record (CVR) for each cast
paper vote, while the others do not. Complex situations such as this may arise
naturally when some counties in a state have upgraded to new equipment, while
others have not. Bayesian audits are able to handle such situations in a
straightforward manner.
  We also discuss the benefits and relevant considerations for using Bayesian
audits in practice.",1801.00528v2,cs.CR,2018-01-02 00:00:15+00:00,[arxiv.Result.Author('Ronald L. Rivest')],
31,Ellipsis: Towards Efficient System Auditing for Real-Time Systems,"System auditing is a powerful tool that provides insight into the nature of
suspicious events in computing systems, allowing machine operators to detect
and subsequently investigate security incidents. While auditing has proven
invaluable to the security of traditional computers, existing audit frameworks
are rarely designed with consideration for Real-Time Systems (RTS). The
transparency provided by system auditing would be of tremendous benefit in a
variety of security-critical RTS domains, (e.g., autonomous vehicles); however,
if audit mechanisms are not carefully integrated into RTS, auditing can be
rendered ineffectual and violate the real-world temporal requirements of the
RTS.
  In this paper, we demonstrate how to adapt commodity audit frameworks to RTS.
Using Linux Audit as a case study, we first demonstrate that the volume of
audit events generated by commodity frameworks is unsustainable within the
temporal and resource constraints of real-time (RT) applications. To address
this, we present Ellipsis, a set of kernel-based reduction techniques that
leverage the periodic repetitive nature of RT applications to aggressively
reduce the costs of system-level auditing. Ellipsis generates succinct
descriptions of RT applications' expected activity while retaining a detailed
record of unexpected activities, enabling analysis of suspicious activity while
meeting temporal constraints. Our evaluation of Ellipsis, using ArduPilot (an

this audit game model to account for multiple audit resources where each
resource is restricted to audit a subset of all potential violations, thus
enabling application to practical auditing scenarios. We provide an FPTAS that
computes an approximately optimal solution to the resulting non-convex

have, for decades, used experimental methods to measure the prevalence of
discrimination across domains like housing and employment. In the social
sciences, audit studies originated in a strong tradition of social justice and
participatory action, often involving collaboration between researchers and
communities; but scholars have argued that, over time, social science audits
have become somewhat distanced from these original goals and priorities. We
draw from this history in order to highlight difficult tensions that have
shaped the development of social science audits, and to assess their
implications in the context of algorithmic auditing. In doing so, we put forth
considerations to assist in the development of robust and engaged assessments
of sociotechnical systems that draw from auditing's roots in racial equity and

kernel modifications, making them difficult to deploy in practical settings.

framework capable of deploying secure system-level audit mechanisms at the
container granularity. We demonstrate the practicality of saBPF in Kubernetes

such as the availability of label information and the knowledge of training
protocols for the target model. Unfortunately, both of these conditions are
often unavailable in real applications. In this paper, we introduce Data
Provenance via Differential Auditing (DPDA), a practical framework for auditing
data provenance with a different approach based on statistically significant
differentials, i.e., after carefully designed transformation, perturbed input
data from the target model's training set would result in much more drastic
changes in the output than those from the model's non-training set. This
framework allows auditors to distinguish training data from non-training ones
without the need of training any shadow models with the help of labeled output
data. Furthermore, we propose two effective auditing function implementations,
an additive one and a multiplicative one. We report evaluations on real-world
data sets demonstrating the effectiveness of our proposed auditing technique.",2209.01538v1,cs.CR,2022-09-04 06:02:25+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Xin Mu'), arxiv.Result.Author('Ming Pang'), arxiv.Result.Author('Feida Zhu')]",

regarding sample planning for audits is incomplete and often includes
restrictive assumptions. To fill these gaps, we exploit the special
relationship between the known claim amounts and the unknown post-audit
amounts. We propose a hypergeometric generative process for audit populations
which we use to derive estimators of variances needed for sample size
determination. We further develop a criterion for choosing between simple
expansion and ratio estimation and an efficient method for determining exact
optimal strata breakpoints in populations with repeated values. We also derive
a variance estimator under a more general ""partial error"" model than previous
researchers have used. These tools apply more generally to audits where an
overstated book/claim amount is the primary concern and estimation of the total
dollar value of the claim errors is the goal. The sample design methods we

41,"Algorithmic audits of algorithms, and the law","Algorithmic decision making is now widespread, ranging from health care
allocation to more common actions such as recommendation or information
ranking. The aim to audit these algorithms has grown alongside. In this paper,
we focus on external audits that are conducted by interacting with the user
side of the target algorithm, hence considered as a black box. Yet, the legal
framework in which these audits take place is mostly ambiguous to researchers
developing them: on the one hand, the legal value of the audit outcome is
uncertain; on the other hand the auditors' rights and obligations are unclear.
The contribution of this paper is to articulate two canonical audit forms to
law, to shed light on these aspects: 1) the first audit form (we coin the Bobby
audit form) checks a predicate against the algorithm, while the second
(Sherlock) is more loose and opens up to multiple investigations. We find that:
Bobby audits are more amenable to prosecution, yet are delicate as operating on
real user data. This can lead to reject by a court (notion of admissibility).
Sherlock audits craft data for their operation, most notably to build
surrogates of the audited algorithm. It is mostly used for acts for
whistleblowing, as even if accepted as a proof, the evidential value will be
low in practice. 2) these two forms require the prior respect of a proper right
to audit, granted by law or by the platform being audited; otherwise the
auditor will be also prone to prosecutions regardless of the audit outcome.

to structure the growing field of algorithm auditing.",2203.03711v1,cs.CY,2022-02-15 14:20:53+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Erwan Le Merrer'), arxiv.Result.Author('Ronan Pons'), arxiv.Result.Author('Gilles Trédan')]",

44,Auditable Restoration of Distributed Programs,"We focus on a protocol for auditable restoration of distributed systems. The
need for such protocol arises due to conflicting requirements (e.g., access to
the system should be restricted but emergency access should be provided). One
can design such systems with a tamper detection approach (based on the
intuition of ""break the glass door""). However, in a distributed system, such
tampering, which are denoted as auditable events, is visible only for a single
node. This is unacceptable since the actions they take in these situations can
be different than those in the normal mode. Moreover, eventually, the auditable
event needs to be cleared so that system resumes the normal operation.
  With this motivation, in this paper, we present a protocol for auditable
restoration, where any process can potentially identify an auditable event.
Whenever a new auditable event occurs, the system must reach an ""auditable
state"" where every process is aware of the auditable event. Only after the
system reaches an auditable state, it can begin the operation of restoration.
Although any process can observe an auditable event, we require that only
""authorized"" processes can begin the task of restoration. Moreover, these
processes can begin the restoration only when the system is in an auditable
state. Our protocol is self-stabilizing and has bounded state space. It can
effectively handle the case where faults or auditable events occur during the
restoration protocol. Moreover, it can be used to provide auditable restoration

characteristics of journal entry data. We evaluate the framework on two
real-world datasets of city payments and transfer the learned representations

documentation. Our experimental results provide empirical evidence that the

learning rich and interpretable `multi-task' representations.",2109.11201v1,cs.LG,2021-09-23 08:16:31+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Marco Schreyer'), arxiv.Result.Author('Timur Sattarov'), arxiv.Result.Author('Damian Borth')]",
50,Bayesian Tabulation Audits: Explained and Extended,"Tabulation audits for an election provide statistical evidence that a
reported contest outcome is ""correct"" (meaning that the tabulation of votes was
properly performed), or else the tabulation audit determines the correct
outcome.
  Stark proposed risk-limiting tabulation audits for this purpose; such audits
are effective and are beginning to be used in practice.
  We expand the study of election audits based on Bayesian methods, first
introduced by Rivest and Shen in 2012. (The risk-limiting audits proposed by
Stark are ""frequentist"" rather than Bayesian in character.)
  We first provide a simplified presentation of Bayesian tabulation audits. A
Bayesian tabulation audit begins by drawing a random sample of the votes in
that contest, and tallying those votes. It then considers what effect
statistical variations of this tally have on the contest outcome. If such
variations almost always yield the previously-reported outcome, the audit
terminates, accepting the reported outcome. Otherwise the audit is repeated
with an enlarged sample.
  Bayesian audits are attractive because they work with any method for
determining the winner (such as ranked-choice voting).
  We then show how Bayesian audits may be extended to handle more complex
situations, such as auditing contests that \emph{span multiple jurisdictions},
or are otherwise ""stratified.""
  We highlight the auditing of such multiple-jurisdiction contests where some
of the jurisdictions have an electronic cast vote record (CVR) for each cast
paper vote, while the others do not. Complex situations such as this may arise
naturally when some counties in a state have upgraded to new equipment, while
others have not. Bayesian audits are able to handle such situations in a
straightforward manner.
  We also discuss the benefits and relevant considerations for using Bayesian
audits in practice.",1801.00528v2,cs.CR,2018-01-02 00:00:15+00:00,[arxiv.Result.Author('Ronald L. Rivest')],
51,Ellipsis: Towards Efficient System Auditing for Real-Time Systems,"System auditing is a powerful tool that provides insight into the nature of
suspicious events in computing systems, allowing machine operators to detect
and subsequently investigate security incidents. While auditing has proven
invaluable to the security of traditional computers, existing audit frameworks
are rarely designed with consideration for Real-Time Systems (RTS). The
transparency provided by system auditing would be of tremendous benefit in a
variety of security-critical RTS domains, (e.g., autonomous vehicles); however,
if audit mechanisms are not carefully integrated into RTS, auditing can be
rendered ineffectual and violate the real-world temporal requirements of the
RTS.
  In this paper, we demonstrate how to adapt commodity audit frameworks to RTS.
Using Linux Audit as a case study, we first demonstrate that the volume of
audit events generated by commodity frameworks is unsustainable within the
temporal and resource constraints of real-time (RT) applications. To address
this, we present Ellipsis, a set of kernel-based reduction techniques that
leverage the periodic repetitive nature of RT applications to aggressively
reduce the costs of system-level auditing. Ellipsis generates succinct
descriptions of RT applications' expected activity while retaining a detailed
record of unexpected activities, enabling analysis of suspicious activity while
meeting temporal constraints. Our evaluation of Ellipsis, using ArduPilot (an

this audit game model to account for multiple audit resources where each
resource is restricted to audit a subset of all potential violations, thus
enabling application to practical auditing scenarios. We provide an FPTAS that

have, for decades, used experimental methods to measure the prevalence of
discrimination across domains like housing and employment. In the social
sciences, audit studies originated in a strong tradition of social justice and
participatory action, often involving collaboration between researchers and
communities; but scholars have argued that, over time, social science audits
have become somewhat distanced from these original goals and priorities. We
draw from this history in order to highlight difficult tensions that have
shaped the development of social science audits, and to assess their
implications in the context of algorithmic auditing. In doing so, we put forth

such as the availability of label information and the knowledge of training
protocols for the target model. Unfortunately, both of these conditions are
often unavailable in real applications. In this paper, we introduce Data
Provenance via Differential Auditing (DPDA), a practical framework for auditing
data provenance with a different approach based on statistically significant
differentials, i.e., after carefully designed transformation, perturbed input
data from the target model's training set would result in much more drastic
changes in the output than those from the model's non-training set. This
framework allows auditors to distinguish training data from non-training ones
without the need of training any shadow models with the help of labeled output
data. Furthermore, we propose two effective auditing function implementations,
an additive one and a multiplicative one. We report evaluations on real-world

restrictive assumptions. To fill these gaps, we exploit the special
relationship between the known claim amounts and the unknown post-audit

which we use to derive estimators of variances needed for sample size
determination. We further develop a criterion for choosing between simple
expansion and ratio estimation and an efficient method for determining exact
optimal strata breakpoints in populations with repeated values. We also derive
a variance estimator under a more general ""partial error"" model than previous
researchers have used. These tools apply more generally to audits where an
overstated book/claim amount is the primary concern and estimation of the total
dollar value of the claim errors is the goal. The sample design methods we

notions makes it difficult to automate bias evaluation in diverse algorithmic

assessment model (LAM) to characterize binary feedback provided by human
auditors, by assuming that the auditor compares the classifier's output to his
or her own intrinsic judgment for each input. We prove that individual and
group fairness notions are guaranteed as long as the auditor's intrinsic
judgments inherently satisfy the fairness notion at hand, and are relatively
similar to the classifier's evaluations. We also demonstrate this relationship
between LAM and traditional fairness notions on three well-known datasets,
namely COMPAS, German credit and Adult Census Income datasets. Furthermore, we
also derive the minimum number of feedback samples needed to obtain PAC

62,Non-Comparative Fairness for Human-Auditing and Its Relation to Traditional Fairness Notions,"Bias evaluation in machine-learning based services (MLS) based on traditional
algorithmic fairness notions that rely on comparative principles is practically
difficult, making it necessary to rely on human auditor feedback. However, in
spite of taking rigorous training on various comparative fairness notions,
human auditors are known to disagree on various aspects of fairness notions in
practice, making it difficult to collect reliable feedback. This paper offers a
paradigm shift to the domain of algorithmic fairness via proposing a new
fairness notion based on the principle of non-comparative justice. In contrary
to traditional fairness notions where the outcomes of two individuals/groups
are compared, our proposed notion compares the MLS' outcome with a desired
outcome for each input. This desired outcome naturally describes a human
auditor's expectation, and can be easily used to evaluate MLS on crowd-auditing
platforms. We show that any MLS can be deemed fair from the perspective of
comparative fairness (be it in terms of individual fairness, statistical
parity, equal opportunity or calibration) if it is non-comparatively fair with
respect to a fair auditor. We also show that the converse holds true in the
context of individual fairness. Given that such an evaluation relies on the
trustworthiness of the auditor, we also present an approach to identify fair
and reliable auditors by estimating their biases with respect to a given set of
sensitive attributes, as well as quantify the uncertainty in the estimation of
biases within a given MLS. Furthermore, all of the above results are also
validated on COMPAS, German credit and Adult Census Income datasets.",2107.01277v1,cs.LG,2021-06-29 20:05:22+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Mukund Telukunta'), arxiv.Result.Author('Venkata Sriram Siddhardh Nadendla')]",

statistically significant enhancement of the distress prediction performance,
in particular for large firms where accurate predictions are of the utmost
importance. Furthermore, we find that auditors' reports are more informative

64,Context-Auditor: Context-sensitive Content Injection Mitigation,"Cross-site scripting (XSS) is the most common vulnerability class in web
applications over the last decade. Much research attention has focused on
building exploit mitigation defenses for this problem, but no technique
provides adequate protection in the face of advanced attacks. One technique
that bypasses XSS mitigations is the scriptless attack: a content injection
technique that uses (among other options) CSS and HTML injection to infiltrate
data. In studying this technique and others, we realized that the common
property among the exploitation of all content injection vulnerabilities,
including not just XSS and scriptless attacks, but also command injections and
several others, is an unintended context switch in the victim program's parsing
engine that is caused by untrusted user input.
  In this paper, we propose Context-Auditor, a novel technique that leverages
this insight to identify content injection vulnerabilities ranging from XSS to
scriptless attacks and command injections. We implemented Context-Auditor as a
general solution to content injection exploit detection problem in the form of
a flexible, stand-alone detection module. We deployed instances of
Context-Auditor as (1) a browser plugin, (2) a web proxy (3) a web server
plugin, and (4) as a wrapper around potentially-injectable system endpoints.
Because Context-Auditor targets the root cause of content injection

results demonstrate that Context-Auditor can identify and block content

65,On the Identification of Fair Auditors to Evaluate Recommender Systems based on a Novel Non-Comparative Fairness Notion,"Decision-support systems are information systems that offer support to
people's decisions in various applications such as judiciary, real-estate and
banking sectors. Lately, these support systems have been found to be
discriminatory in the context of many practical deployments. In an attempt to
evaluate and mitigate these biases, algorithmic fairness literature has been
nurtured using notions of comparative justice, which relies primarily on
comparing two/more individuals or groups within the society that is supported
by such systems. However, such a fairness notion is not very useful in the
identification of fair auditors who are hired to evaluate latent biases within
decision-support systems. As a solution, we introduce a paradigm shift in
algorithmic fairness via proposing a new fairness notion based on the principle
of non-comparative justice. Assuming that the auditor makes fairness
evaluations based on some (potentially unknown) desired properties of the
decision-support system, the proposed fairness notion compares the system's
outcome with that of the auditor's desired outcome. We show that the proposed
fairness notion also provides guarantees in terms of comparative fairness
notions by proving that any system can be deemed fair from the perspective of
comparative fairness (e.g. individual fairness and statistical parity) if it is
non-comparatively fair with respect to an auditor who has been deemed fair with
respect to the same fairness notions. We also show that the converse holds true

better-off when they pollute and are not inspected, while social welfare is
maximized when auditors do not need to inspect socially responsible
corporations that account for pollution in their production decisions regarding
technology used and emission level. Starting with a well-mixed two-population
game model, there is no long-run equilibrium and the shares of polluters and
shirking auditors keep oscillating over time. In contrast, when firms and
auditors are allocated in a spatial network, the game displays a rich dynamics
depending on the inspecting cost. While the oscillatory behaviour is still
possible, there is a set of parameters for which a long run robust equilibrium

71,On the Discredibility of Membership Inference Attacks,"With the wide-spread application of machine learning models, it has become
critical to study the potential data leakage of models trained on sensitive
data. Recently, various membership inference (MI) attacks are proposed that
determines if a sample was part of the training set or not. Although the first
generation of MI attacks has been proven to be ineffective in practice, a few
recent studies proposed practical MI attacks that achieve reasonable true
positive rate at low false positive rate. The question is whether these attacks
can be reliably used in practice. We showcase a practical application of
membership inference attacks where it is used by an auditor (investigator) to
prove to a judge/jury that an auditee unlawfully used sensitive data during
training. Then, we show that the auditee can provide a dataset (with
potentially unlimited number of samples) to a judge where MI attacks
catastrophically fail. Hence, the auditee challenges the credibility of the
auditor and can get the case dismissed. More importantly, we show that the
auditee does not need to know anything about the MI attack neither a query
access to it. In other words, all currently SOTA MI attacks in literature
suffer from the same issue. Through comprehensive experimental evaluation, we
show that our algorithms can increase the false positive rate from ten to
thousands times larger than what auditor claim to the judge. Lastly, we argue
that the implication of our algorithms is beyond discredibility: Current

72,Protecting Spreadsheets Against Fraud,"Previous research on spreadsheet risks has predominantly focussed on errors
inadvertently introduced by spreadsheet writers i.e. it focussed on the
end-user aspects of spreadsheet development. When analyzing a faulty
spreadsheet, one might not be able to determine whether a particular error
(fault) has been made by mistake or with fraudulent intentions. However, the
fences protecting against fraudulent errors have to be different from those
shielding against inadvertent mistakes. Faults resulting from errors committed
inadvertently can be prevented ab initio by tools that notify the spreadsheet
writer about potential problems whereas faults that are introduced on purpose
have to be discovered by auditors without the cooperation of their originators.
Even worse, some spreadsheet writers will do their best to conceal fraudulent
parts of their spreadsheets from auditors. In this paper we survey the
available means for fraud protection by contrasting approaches suitable for
spreadsheets with those known from fraud protection for conventional software.",0801.4268v1,cs.CY,2008-01-28 13:45:28+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Roland T.

authorities, with justification cite spreadsheets containing errors as the norm
rather than the exception). Faced with this body of evidence, the auditor can
be faced with a huge task - the temptation may be to launch code inspections
for every spreadsheet in an organisation. This can be very expensive and
time-consuming. This paper describes risk assessment based on the ""SpACE"" audit
methodology used by H M Customs & Excise's tax inspectors. This allows the
auditor to target resources on the spreadsheets posing the highest risk of
error, and justify the deployment of those resources to managers and clients.
Since the opposite of audit risk is audit assurance the paper also offers an
overview of some elements of good practice in the use of spreadsheets in

loss and liability issues towards their customers and other involved entities.
Detecting internal fraud in a company requires significant effort and,
unfortunately cannot be entirely prevented. The internal auditors have to
process a huge amount of data produced by diverse systems, which are in most
cases in textual form, with little automated support. In this paper, we exploit
the advantages of information visualization and present a system that aims to
detect occupational fraud in systems which involve a pair of entities (e.g., an
employee and a client) and periodic activity. The main visualization is based
on a spiral system on which the events are drawn appropriately according to
their time-stamp. Suspicious events are considered those which appear along the
same radius or on close radii of the spiral. Before producing the
visualization, the system ranks both involved entities according to the
specifications of the internal auditor and generates a video file of the
activity such that events with strong evidence of fraud appear first in the
video. The system is also equipped with several different visualizations and

public accountability via public transparency and indirect public

instrumentally ethically valuable and required as a matter of deontology from
the principle of democratic self-government. We analyze the regulatory content
of 16 guideline documents about the use of AI in the public sector, by mapping
their requirements to those of our philosophical account of accountability, and
conclude that while some guidelines refer to processes that amount to auditing,
it seems that the debate would benefit from more clarity about the nature of

the sound of crunchy apple bite. Both male and female participants were exposed
to periodic auditory icon loop, with the auditory icon played every 10 second.
Participants were also exposed to non-periodic auditory icon loop which uses
the same auditory icon but was made to represent the eating behaviour of a real

the male non-periodic auditory icon loop. Although female participants mimicked
the female auditory icon loop, the result is not significant. Both male and
female did not mimic the periodic auditory icon loop. Thus, only auditory icons

addition, studies have shown that excessive noise in general can cause rapid
physiological changes of constituents of the auditory within the cochlea. Here,
we report in-situ measurements of the acoustic noise from a 1.5 Tesla MRI

Recently, studies show that the alpha band (8-13 Hz) EEG signals enable the
localization of auditory stimuli. We believe that it is possible to detect
auditory spatial attention without the need of auditory stimuli as references.
In this work, we use alpha power signals for automatic auditory spatial
attention detection. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to
detect spatial attention based on alpha power neural signals. We propose a
spectro-spatial feature extraction technique to detect the auditory spatial
attention (left/right) based on the topographic specificity of alpha power.

86,Treatise on Hearing: The Temporal Auditory Imaging Theory Inspired by Optics and Communication,"A new theory of mammalian hearing is presented, which accounts for the
auditory image in the midbrain (inferior colliculus) of objects in the
acoustical environment of the listener. It is shown that the ear is a temporal
imaging system that comprises three transformations of the envelope functions:
cochlear group-delay dispersion, cochlear time lensing, and neural group-delay
dispersion. These elements are analogous to the optical transformations in
vision of diffraction between the object and the eye, spatial lensing by the
lens, and second diffraction between the lens and the retina. Unlike the eye,
it is established that the human auditory system is naturally defocused, so
that coherent stimuli do not react to the defocus, whereas completely
incoherent stimuli are impacted by it and may be blurred by design. It is
argued that the auditory system can use this differential focusing to enhance
or degrade the images of real-world acoustical objects that are partially
coherent. The theory is founded on coherence and temporal imaging theories that
were adopted from optics. In addition to the imaging transformations, the
corresponding inverse-domain modulation transfer functions are derived and
interpreted with consideration to the nonuniform neural sampling operation of
the auditory nerve. These ideas are used to rigorously initiate the concepts of
sharpness and blur in auditory imaging, auditory aberrations, and auditory
depth of field. In parallel, ideas from communication theory are used to show
that the organ of Corti functions as a multichannel phase-locked loop (PLL)
that constitutes the point of entry for auditory phase locking and hence
conserves the signal coherence. It provides an anchor for a dual coherent and
noncoherent auditory detection in the auditory brain that culminates in
auditory accommodation. Implications on hearing impairments are discussed as

the human auditory system, that include the cochlear filter bank, the inner
hair cells, auditory masking effects from psychoacoustic models, and the spike
neural encoding by the auditory nerve. We evaluate the perceptual quality of
the BAE scheme using PESQ; the performance of the BAE based on speech

classification results in spatial auditory paradigms by incorporating the N200
latencies, which differentiate the brain responses to lateral, in relation to
the subject head, sound locations in the auditory space. The results reveal
that those early spatial auditory ERPs boost online classification results of

generating repetitive syllable sequences in songbirds. We propose that auditory
signals provide positive feedback to ongoing motor commands, but this influence
decays as feedback weakens from response adaptation during syllable
repetitions. Computational models show that this mechanism explains repeat
distributions observed in Bengalese finch song. We experimentally confirmed two
predictions of this mechanism in Bengalese finches: removal of auditory
feedback by deafening reduces syllable repetitions; and neural responses to
auditory playback of repeated syllable sequences gradually adapt in
sensory-motor nucleus HVC. Together, our results implicate a positive
auditory-feedback loop with adaptation in generating repetitive vocalizations,

display approaches have failed to implement auditory dimensions that are
perceived orthogonally by a user. In this study we demonstrate how a location
in three-dimensional space can be sonified unambiguously by the implementation

Method: Perceptually orthogonal auditory attributes are identified from
literature research and experience in music and psychoacoustic research. We
carried out an experiment with 21 participants who identified sonified
locations in two-dimensional space. Results: With just 5 minutes of explanation
and exploration, naive users can interpret our multidimensional sonification
with high accuracy. Conclusion: We identified a set of perceptually orthogonal

example during development or in response to altered auditory cues such as a
modified pinna. We studied neural network models that learn to localise a
single sound source in the horizontal plane using binaural cues based on
limited supervisions. These supervisions can be unreliable or sparse in real
life. First, a simple model that has unreliable estimation of the sound source
location is built, in order to simulate the unreliable auditory orienting
response of newborns. It is used as a Teacher that acts as a source of
unreliable supervisions. Then we show that it is possible to learn a continuous
auditory space map based only on noisy left or right feedbacks from the
Teacher. Furthermore, reinforcement rewards from the environment are used as a
source of sparse supervision. By combining the unreliable innate response and
the sparse reinforcement rewards, an accurate auditory space map, which is hard

97,A point process framework for modeling electrical stimulation of the auditory nerve,"Model-based studies of auditory nerve responses to electrical stimulation can
provide insight into the functioning of cochlear implants. Ideally, these
studies can identify limitations in sound processing strategies and lead to
improved methods for providing sound information to cochlear implant users. To
accomplish this, models must accurately describe auditory nerve spiking while
avoiding excessive complexity that would preclude large-scale simulations of
populations of auditory nerve fibers and obscure insight into the mechanisms
that influence neural encoding of sound information. In this spirit, we develop
a point process model of the auditory nerve that provides a compact and
accurate description of neural responses to electric stimulation. Inspired by
the framework of generalized linear models, the proposed model consists of a
cascade of linear and nonlinear stages. We show how each of these stages can be
associated with biophysical mechanisms and related to models of neuronal
dynamics. Moreover, we derive a semi-analytical procedure that uniquely
determines each parameter in the model on the basis of fundamental statistics
from recordings of single fiber responses to electric stimulation, including
threshold, relative spread, jitter, and chronaxie. The model also accounts for
refractory and summation effects that influence the responses of auditory nerve
fibers to high pulse rate stimulation. Throughout, we compare model predictions
to published physiological data and explain differences in auditory nerve
responses to high and low pulse rate stimulation. We close by performing an
ideal observer analysis of simulated spike trains in response to sinusoidally
amplitude modulated stimuli and find that carrier pulse rate does not affect
modulation detection thresholds.",1201.5428v1,q-bio.NC,2012-01-26 02:14:16+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Joshua H. Goldwyn'), arxiv.Result.Author('Jay T. Rubinstein'), arxiv.Result.Author('Eric Shea-Brown')]",
98,PhyAAt: Physiology of Auditory Attention to Speech Dataset,"Auditory attention to natural speech is a complex brain process. Its
quantification from physiological signals can be valuable to improving and
widening the range of applications of current brain-computer-interface systems,
however it remains a challenging task. In this article, we present a dataset of
physiological signals collected from an experiment on auditory attention to
natural speech. In this experiment, auditory stimuli consisting of
reproductions of English sentences in different auditory conditions were
presented to 25 non-native participants, who were asked to transcribe the
sentences. During the experiment, 14 channel electroencephalogram, galvanic
skin response, and photoplethysmogram signals were collected from each

score was obtained for each auditory stimulus presented to subjects. A strong
correlation ($p<<0.0001$) between the attention score and the auditory
conditions was found. We also formulate four different predictive tasks
involving the collected dataset and develop a feature extraction framework. The
results for each predictive task are obtained using a Support Vector Machine

99,Deep Neural Networks on EEG Signals to Predict Auditory Attention Score Using Gramian Angular Difference Field,"Auditory attention is a selective type of hearing in which people focus their
attention intentionally on a specific source of a sound or spoken words whilst
ignoring or inhibiting other auditory stimuli. In some sense, the auditory
attention score of an individual shows the focus the person can have in
auditory tasks. The recent advancements in deep learning and in the
non-invasive technologies recording neural activity beg the question, can deep
learning along with technologies such as electroencephalography (EEG) be used
to predict the auditory attention score of an individual? In this paper, we
focus on this very problem of estimating a person's auditory attention level
based on their brain's electrical activity captured using 14-channeled EEG
signals. More specifically, we deal with attention estimation as a regression
problem. The work has been performed on the publicly available Phyaat dataset.
The concept of Gramian Angular Difference Field (GADF) has been used to convert
time-series EEG data into an image having 14 channels, enabling us to train
various deep learning models such as 2D CNN, 3D CNN, and convolutional
autoencoders. Their performances have been compared amongst themselves as well

100,Fibrations of predicates and bicategories of relations,"We reconcile the two different category-theoretic semantics of regular
theories in predicate logic. A 2-category of `regular fibrations' is
constructed, as well as a 2-category of `regular proarrow equipments', and it
is shown that the two are equivalent. A regular equipment is a `cartesian
equipment' satisfying certain axioms, and a cartesian equipment is a slight
generalization of a cartesian bicategory.
  This is done by defining a tricategory Biprof whose objects are bicategories
and whose morphisms are category-valued profunctors, and then defining an
equipment to be a pseudo-monad in this tricategory. The resulting notion of
equipment is compared to several existing ones. Most importantly, this involves
showing that every pseudo-monad in Biprof has a Kleisli object. A strict
2-category of equipments, over locally discrete base bicategories, is
identified, and cartesian equipments are defined to be the cartesian objects in
this 2-category. Thus cartesian equipments themselves form a 2-category, and
this is shown to admit a 2-fully-faithful functor from the 2-category of
regular fibrations. The cartesian equipments in the image of this functor are
characterized as those satisfying certain axioms, and hence a 2-category of
`regular equipments' is identified that is equivalent to that of regular
fibrations.
  It is then shown that a regular fibration admits comprehension for predicates
if and only if its corresponding regular equipment admits tabulation for
morphisms, and further that the presence of tabulations for morphisms is
equivalent to the existence of Eilenberg--Moore objects for co-monads. We
conclude with a brief examination of the two different constructions of the
effective topos, via triposes and via assemblies, in the light of the
foregoing.",1502.08017v1,math.CT,2015-02-27 19:07:02+00:00,[arxiv.Result.Author('Finn Lawler')],
101,Bayesian Tabulation Audits: Explained and Extended,"Tabulation audits for an election provide statistical evidence that a
reported contest outcome is ""correct"" (meaning that the tabulation of votes was
properly performed), or else the tabulation audit determines the correct
outcome.
  Stark proposed risk-limiting tabulation audits for this purpose; such audits
are effective and are beginning to be used in practice.
  We expand the study of election audits based on Bayesian methods, first
introduced by Rivest and Shen in 2012. (The risk-limiting audits proposed by
Stark are ""frequentist"" rather than Bayesian in character.)
  We first provide a simplified presentation of Bayesian tabulation audits. A
Bayesian tabulation audit begins by drawing a random sample of the votes in
that contest, and tallying those votes. It then considers what effect
statistical variations of this tally have on the contest outcome. If such
variations almost always yield the previously-reported outcome, the audit
terminates, accepting the reported outcome. Otherwise the audit is repeated
with an enlarged sample.
  Bayesian audits are attractive because they work with any method for
determining the winner (such as ranked-choice voting).
  We then show how Bayesian audits may be extended to handle more complex
situations, such as auditing contests that \emph{span multiple jurisdictions},
or are otherwise ""stratified.""
  We highlight the auditing of such multiple-jurisdiction contests where some
of the jurisdictions have an electronic cast vote record (CVR) for each cast
paper vote, while the others do not. Complex situations such as this may arise
naturally when some counties in a state have upgraded to new equipment, while
others have not. Bayesian audits are able to handle such situations in a
straightforward manner.
  We also discuss the benefits and relevant considerations for using Bayesian
audits in practice.",1801.00528v2,cs.CR,2018-01-02 00:00:15+00:00,[arxiv.Result.Author('Ronald L. Rivest')],

small set of heuristics to identify common cases, such as expressions that will
propagate weakly. The process of discovering promising subproblems and
tabulating them is entirely automated in the constraint modelling tool Savile
Row. Caches are implemented to avoid tabulating equivalent subproblems many
times. We give a simple algorithm to generate table constraints directly from a
constraint expression in \savilerow. We demonstrate good performance on the
benchmark problems used in earlier work on tabulation, and also for several new
problem classes. In some cases, the entirely automated process leads to orders

estimates using American Community Survey data and other sample survey data has
been a topic of recent interest among data-users and federal statistical
agencies. One strategy is to use a multivariate spatial mixed effects model
with a Gaussian observation model and latent Gaussian process model. In
practice, this works well for a wide range of tabulations. Nevertheless, in
situations that exhibit heterogeneity among geographies and/or sparsity in the
data, the Gaussian assumptions may be problematic and lead to underperformance.
To remedy these situations, we propose a multivariate hierarchical Bayesian

flexibility. The number of clusters is chosen automatically in a data-driven

depends on proper tissue segmentation, especially in heterogeneous organs such
as the prostate. Using trained network-based image segmentation, we
investigated if MRE data suffice to extract anatomical and viscoelastic
information for automatic tabulation of zonal mechanical properties of the
prostate. Overall, 40 patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) or
prostate cancer (PCa) were examined with three magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
sequences: T2-weighted MRI (T2w), diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI), and
MRE-based tomoelastography yielding six independent sets of imaging data per
patient (T2w, DWI, apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), MRE magnitude, shear
wave speed, and loss angle maps). Combinations of these data were used to train
Dense U-nets with manually segmented masks of the entire prostate gland (PG),
central zone (CZ), and peripheral zone (PZ) in 30 patients and to validate them
in 10 patients. Dice score (DS), sensitivity, specificity, and Hausdorff
distance were determined. We found that segmentation based on MRE magnitude
maps alone (DS, PG: 0.93$\pm$0.04, CZ: 0.95$\pm$0.03, PZ: 0.77$\pm$0.05) was
more accurate than magnitude maps combined with T2w and DWI_b (DS, PG:

entity recognition}, which identifies key entities within text, such as drug
names, and \textit{relation extraction}, which maps their relationships for
separating them into ordered tuples. We focus on the automatic tabulation of
sentences from published RCT abstracts that report the results of the study

from six disease areas. This approach demonstrated significant advantages, with
our system performing well across multiple natural language processing tasks
and disease areas, as well as in generalising to disease domains unseen during
training. Furthermore, we show these results were achievable through training

governing the interaction order modelled. The order $n$ best suited to describe
a given system can be found automatically within the Bayesian framework by
maximisation of the marginal likelihood. The procedure is first tested on a toy
model of known interaction and later applied to two real materials described at
the DFT level of accuracy. The models automatically selected for the two
materials were found to be in agreement with physical intuition. More in
general, it was found that lower order (simpler) models should be chosen when
the data are not sufficient to resolve more complex interactions. Low $n$ GPs
can be further sped up by orders of magnitude by constructing the corresponding

119,Artificial Intelligence Enabled Traffic Monitoring System,"Manual traffic surveillance can be a daunting task as Traffic Management
Centers operate a myriad of cameras installed over a network. Injecting some
level of automation could help lighten the workload of human operators
performing manual surveillance and facilitate making proactive decisions which
would reduce the impact of incidents and recurring congestion on roadways. This
article presents a novel approach to automatically monitor real time traffic
footage using deep convolutional neural networks and a stand-alone graphical
user interface. The authors describe the results of research received in the
process of developing models that serve as an integrated framework for an
artificial intelligence enabled traffic monitoring system. The proposed system
deploys several state-of-the-art deep learning algorithms to automate different
traffic monitoring needs. Taking advantage of a large database of annotated
video surveillance data, deep learning-based models are trained to detect
queues, track stationary vehicles, and tabulate vehicle counts. A pixel-level
segmentation approach is applied to detect traffic queues and predict severity.
Real-time object detection algorithms coupled with different tracking systems
are deployed to automatically detect stranded vehicles as well as perform
vehicular counts. At each stages of development, interesting experimental
results are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed system.
Overall, the results demonstrate that the proposed framework performs
satisfactorily under varied conditions without being immensely impacted by
environmental hazards such as blurry camera views, low illumination, rain, or
snow.",2010.01217v1,cs.CV,2020-10-02 22:28:02+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Vishal Mandal'), arxiv.Result.Author('Abdul Rashid Mussah'), arxiv.Result.Author('Peng Jin'), arxiv.Result.Author('Yaw Adu-Gyamfi')]",
120,Sincere-Strategy Preference-Based Approval Voting Fully Resists Constructive Control and Broadly Resists Destructive Control,"We study sincere-strategy preference-based approval voting (SP-AV), a system
proposed by Brams and Sanver [Electoral Studies, 25(2):287-305, 2006], and here
adjusted so as to coerce admissibility of the votes (rather than excluding
inadmissible votes a priori), with respect to procedural control. In such
control scenarios, an external agent seeks to change the outcome of an election
via actions such as adding/deleting/partitioning either candidates or voters.
SP-AV combines the voters' preference rankings with their approvals of
candidates, where in elections with at least two candidates the voters'
approval strategies are adjusted--if needed--to approve of their most-preferred
candidate and to disapprove of their least-preferred candidate. This rule
coerces admissibility of the votes even in the presence of control actions, and
hybridizes, in effect, approval with pluralitiy voting.
  We prove that this system is computationally resistant (i.e., the
corresponding control problems are NP-hard) to 19 out of 22 types of
constructive and destructive control. Thus, SP-AV has more resistances to
control than is currently known for any other natural voting system with a
polynomial-time winner problem. In particular, SP-AV is (after Copeland voting,
see Faliszewski et al. [AAIM-2008, Springer LNCS 5034, pp. 165-176, 2008]) the
second natural voting system with an easy winner-determination procedure that
is known to have full resistance to constructive control, and unlike Copeland
voting it in addition displays broad resistance to destructive control.",0806.0535v5,cs.GT,2008-06-03 13:27:16+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Gabor Erdelyi'), arxiv.Result.Author('Markus Nowak'), arxiv.Result.Author('Joerg Rothe')]",

winner and loser. We emphasize the STV system, which we have found to work well
in practice for multi-winner elections with small electorates, such as
committee and council elections, and the selection of multiple job candidates.
For single-winner elections, the STV is also called instant runoff voting
(IRV), ranked choice voting (RCV), or the alternative vote (AV) system. The
package also implements the STV system with equal preferences, for the first
time in a software package, to our knowledge. It also implements a new variant
of STV, in which a minimum number of candidates from a specified group are
required to be elected. We illustrate the package with several real examples.",2102.05801v1,stat.CO,2021-02-11 01:50:46+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Adrian E. Raftery'), arxiv.Result.Author('Hana Ševčíková'), arxiv.Result.Author('Bernard W. Silverman')]",
122,Heuristics in Multi-Winner Approval Voting,"In many real world situations, collective decisions are made using voting.
Moreover, scenarios such as committee or board elections require voting rules
that return multiple winners. In multi-winner approval voting (AV), an agent
may vote for as many candidates as they wish. Winners are chosen by tallying up
the votes and choosing the top-$k$ candidates receiving the most votes. An
agent may manipulate the vote to achieve a better outcome by voting in a way
that does not reflect their true preferences. In complex and uncertain
situations, agents may use heuristics to strategize, instead of incurring the
additional effort required to compute the manipulation which most favors them.
In this paper, we examine voting behavior in multi-winner approval voting
scenarios with complete information. We show that people generally manipulate
their vote to obtain a better outcome, but often do not identify the optimal
manipulation. Instead, voters tend to prioritize the candidates with the
highest utilities. Using simulations, we demonstrate the effectiveness of these
heuristics in situations where agents only have access to partial information.",1905.12104v2,cs.GT,2019-05-28 21:44:07+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Jaelle Scheuerman'), arxiv.Result.Author('Jason L. Harman'), arxiv.Result.Author('Nicholas Mattei'), arxiv.Result.Author('K. Brent Venable')]",
123,Bucklin Voting is Broadly Resistant to Control,"Electoral control models ways of changing the outcome of an election via such
actions as adding/deleting/partitioning either candidates or voters. These
actions modify an election's participation structure and aim at either making a
favorite candidate win (""constructive control"") or prevent a despised candidate
from winning (""destructive control""), which yields a total of 22 standard
control scenarios. To protect elections from such control attempts,
computational complexity has been used to show that electoral control, though
not impossible, is computationally prohibitive. Among natural voting systems
with a polynomial-time winner problem, the two systems with the highest number
of proven resistances to control types (namely 19 out of 22) are
""sincere-strategy preference-based approval voting"" (SP-AV, a modification of a
system proposed by Brams and Sanver) and fallback voting. Both are hybrid
systems; e.g., fallback voting combines approval with Bucklin voting. In this
paper, we study the control complexity of Bucklin voting itself and show that
it behaves equally well in terms of control resistance for the 20 cases
investigated so far. As Bucklin voting is a special case of fallback voting,
all resistances shown for Bucklin voting in this paper strengthen the
corresponding resistance for fallback voting.",1005.4115v1,cs.CC,2010-05-22 09:12:04+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Gábor Erdélyi'), arxiv.Result.Author('Lena Piras'), arxiv.Result.Author('Jörg Rothe')]",

preferences over the alternatives. We consider several voting mechanisms:
plurality voting and approval voting with deterministic or uniform tie-breaking
rules. We show that strategic voting in these voting procedures may lead to a
very undesirable outcome: Condorcet winning alternative might be rejected,
Condorcet losing alternative might be elected, and Pareto dominated alternative
might be elected. These undesirable phenomena occur already with four
alternatives and a small number of voters. For the case of three alternatives
we present positive and negative results.",1807.03979v2,cs.GT,2018-07-11 07:50:42+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Oren Dean'), arxiv.Result.Author('Yakov Babichenko'), arxiv.Result.Author('Moshe Tennenholtz')]",
125,Control Complexity in Fallback Voting,"We study the control complexity of fallback voting. Like manipulation and
bribery, electoral control describes ways of changing the outcome of an
election; unlike manipulation or bribery attempts, control actions---such as
adding/deleting/partitioning either candidates or voters---modify the
participative structure of an election. Via such actions one can try to either
make a favorite candidate win (""constructive control"") or prevent a despised
candidate from winning (""destructive control""). Computational complexity can be
used to protect elections from control attempts, i.e., proving an election
system resistant to some type of control shows that the success of the
corresponding control action, though not impossible, is computationally
prohibitive. We show that fallback voting, an election system combining
approval with majority voting, is resistant to each of the common types of
candidate control and to each common type of constructive control. Among
natural election systems with a polynomial-time winner problem, only plurality
and sincere-strategy preference-based approval voting (SP-AV) were previously
known to be fully resistant to candidate control, and only Copeland voting and
SP-AV were previously known to be fully resistant to constructive control.
However, plurality has fewer resistances to voter control, Copeland voting has
fewer resistances to destructive control, and SP-AV (which like fallback voting
has 19 out of 22 proven control resistances) is arguably less natural a system
than fallback voting.",1004.3398v1,cs.GT,2010-04-20 10:09:50+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Gábor Erdélyi'), arxiv.Result.Author('Lena Piras'), arxiv.Result.Author('Jörg Rothe')]",
126,How to Teach DNNs to Pay Attention to the Visual Modality in Speech Recognition,"Audio-Visual Speech Recognition (AVSR) seeks to model, and thereby exploit,
the dynamic relationship between a human voice and the corresponding mouth
movements. A recently proposed multimodal fusion strategy, AV Align, based on
state-of-the-art sequence to sequence neural networks, attempts to model this
relationship by explicitly aligning the acoustic and visual representations of
speech. This study investigates the inner workings of AV Align and visualises
the audio-visual alignment patterns. Our experiments are performed on two of
the largest publicly available AVSR datasets, TCD-TIMIT and LRS2. We find that
AV Align learns to align acoustic and visual representations of speech at the
frame level on TCD-TIMIT in a generally monotonic pattern. We also determine
the cause of initially seeing no improvement over audio-only speech recognition
on the more challenging LRS2. We propose a regularisation method which involves
predicting lip-related Action Units from visual representations. Our
regularisation method leads to better exploitation of the visual modality, with
performance improvements between 7% and 30% depending on the noise level.
Furthermore, we show that the alternative Watch, Listen, Attend, and Spell
network is affected by the same problem as AV Align, and that our proposed
approach can effectively help it learn visual representations. Our findings
validate the suitability of the regularisation method to AVSR and encourage
researchers to rethink the multimodal convergence problem when having one
dominant modality.",2004.08250v1,eess.AS,2020-04-17 13:59:19+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('George Sterpu'), arxiv.Result.Author('Christian Saam'), arxiv.Result.Author('Naomi Harte')]",

the second round, after the results of the first round have been published, the
remaining citizens decide whether to vote for one alternative or to ab- stain.
The votes from both rounds are aggregated, and the final outcome is obtained by
applying the majority rule, with ties being broken by fair randomization.
Within a costly voting framework, we show that large elec- torates will choose
the preferred alternative of the majority with high prob- ability, and that
average costs will be low. This result is in contrast with the literature on
one-round voting, which predicts either higher voting costs (when voting is

winning alternative. Selection of a winner is accomplished via a voting rule,

voting rule should be used? In social choice theory, desirable properties of
voting rules are expressed as axioms to be satisfied. This thesis focuses on
axioms concerning strategic manipulation by voters. Sometimes, voters may
intentionally misstate their true preferences in order to alter the outcome for
their own advantage. For example, in plurality rule, if a voter knows that
their top-choice candidate will lose, then they might instead vote for their
second-choice candidate just to avoid an even less desirable result. When no
coalition of voters can strategically manipulate, then the voting rule is said
to satisfy the axiom of Strategy-Proofness. A less restrictive axiom is Weak
Strategy-Proofness (as defined by Dasgupta and Maskin (2019)), which allows for
strategic manipulation by all but the smallest coalitions. Under certain
intuitive conditions, Dasgupta and Maskin (2019) proved that the only voting
rules satisfying Strategy-Proofness are rank-order voting and majority rule. In
my thesis, I generalize their result, by proving that rank-order voting and
majority rule are surprisingly still the only voting rules satisfying Weak

desirable properties: for example, they are easy to understand and encourage
the candidates to choose electoral platforms that have a broad appeal. In this
paper, we investigate both classic and parameterized computational complexity
of electoral campaign management under such rules. We focus on two methods that
can be used to promote a given candidate: asking voters to move this candidate
upwards in their preference order or asking them to change the number of
candidates they approve of. We show that finding an optimal campaign management
strategy of the first type is easy for both Bucklin and Fallback. In contrast,
the second method is computationally hard even if the degree to which we need
to affect the votes is small. Nevertheless, we identify a large class of

voting in a way that does not reflect their true preferences. In complex and
uncertain situations, agents may use heuristics instead of incurring the
additional effort required to compute the manipulation which most favors them.
In this paper, we examine voting behavior in single-winner and multi-winner
approval voting scenarios with varying degrees of uncertainty using behavioral
data obtained from Mechanical Turk. We find that people generally manipulate
their vote to obtain a better outcome, but often do not identify the optimal
manipulation. There are a number of predictive models of agent behavior in the
COMSOC and psychology literature that are based on cognitively plausible
heuristic strategies. We show that the existing approaches do not adequately

its surrounding environment. Although visual sensors of an AV, such as camera,
lidar, and radar, help to see its surrounding environment, an AV cannot see
beyond those sensors line of sight. On the other hand, an AV s sense of hearing
cannot be obstructed by line of sight. For example, an AV can identify an
emergency vehicle s siren through audio classification even though the
emergency vehicle is not within the line of sight of the AV. Thus, auditory
perception is complementary to the camera, lidar, and radar-based perception
systems. This paper presents a deep learning-based robust audio classification
framework aiming to achieve improved environmental perception for AVs. The
presented framework leverages a deep Convolution Neural Network (CNN) to
classify different audio classes. UrbanSound8k, an urban environment dataset,
is used to train and test the developed framework. Seven audio classes i.e.,
air conditioner, car horn, children playing, dog bark, engine idling, gunshot,

relevancy related to AVs. Our framework can classify different audio classes

swapping the positions of two consecutive candidates in their preference order,

$\epsilon >0$, with probability at least $1-\epsilon$, the minimum number of
operations that are needed for the strategic individual to achieve her goal

(3) $\Theta(n)$, and (4) $\infty$. This theorem holds for any set of vote
operations, any individual vote distribution $\pi$, and any integer generalized

studied voting rules, e.g., approval voting, all positional scoring rules

problems on metric spaces, we compare voting with and without the use of
proxies to see which mechanism better approximates the optimal outcome, and
characterize the regimes in which proxy voting is beneficial. When voters'
opinions are located on an interval, both the median mechanism and the mean
mechanism are substantially improved by proxy voting. When voters vote on many
binary issues, proxy voting is better when the sample of active voters is too
small to provide a good outcome. Our theoretical results extend to situations

142,AnimeSR: Learning Real-World Super-Resolution Models for Animation Videos,"This paper studies the problem of real-world video super-resolution (VSR) for
animation videos, and reveals three key improvements for practical animation
VSR. First, recent real-world super-resolution approaches typically rely on
degradation simulation using basic operators without any learning capability,
such as blur, noise, and compression. In this work, we propose to learn such
basic operators from real low-quality animation videos, and incorporate the
learned ones into the degradation generation pipeline. Such
neural-network-based basic operators could help to better capture the
distribution of real degradations. Second, a large-scale high-quality animation
video dataset, AVC, is built to facilitate comprehensive training and
evaluations for animation VSR. Third, we further investigate an efficient
multi-scale network structure. It takes advantage of the efficiency of
unidirectional recurrent networks and the effectiveness of sliding-window-based
methods. Thanks to the above delicate designs, our method, AnimeSR, is capable

We determine the randomized coding capacity of both the AVCs under a maximum
probability of error criterion. Similar to other randomized coding setups, we
show that the capacity is the same even under the average probability of error
criterion. Even with non-causal knowledge of the state, we prove that the
state-aware adversary cannot affect the rate any worse than when it employs a

AVC capacity characterization is given in terms of the capacity of the worst
memoryless channels with state, induced by the adversary employing such
memoryless jamming strategies. For the DP-AVC, it is further shown that among
memoryless jamming strategies, none impact the communication more than a

about language. A prominent open question is the question of whether or not it
is necessary to model hierarchical structure. We present a linguistic
investigation of a neural parser adding insights to this question. We look at
transitivity and agreement information of auxiliary verb constructions (AVCs)
in comparison to finite main verbs (FMVs). This comparison is motivated by
theoretical work in dependency grammar and in particular the work of Tesni\`ere
(1959) where AVCs and FMVs are both instances of a nucleus, the basic unit of
syntax. An AVC is a dissociated nucleus, it consists of at least two words, and
an FMV is its non-dissociated counterpart, consisting of exactly one word. We
suggest that the representation of AVCs and FMVs should capture similar
information. We use diagnostic classifiers to probe agreement and transitivity
information in vectors learned by a transition-based neural parser in four
typologically different languages. We find that the parser learns different
information about AVCs and FMVs if only sequential models (BiLSTMs) are used in
the architecture but similar information when a recursive layer is used. We
find explanations for why this is the case by looking closely at how
information is learned in the network and looking at what happens with
different dependency representations of AVCs. We conclude that there may be
benefits to using a recursive layer in dependency parsing and that we have not
yet found the best way to integrate it in our parsers.",1907.07950v2,cs.CL,2019-07-18 09:37:38+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Miryam de Lhoneux'), arxiv.Result.Author('Sara Stymne'), arxiv.Result.Author('Joakim Nivre')]",
149,Modelling Animal-Vehicle Collision Counts across Large Networks Using a Bayesian Hierarchical Model with Time-Varying Parameters,"Animal-vehicle collisions (AVCs) are common around the world and result in
considerable loss of animal and human life, as well as significant property
damage and regular insurance claims. Understanding their occurrence in relation
to various contributing factors and being able to identify locations of high
risk are valuable to AVC prevention, yielding economic, social and
environmental cost savings. However, many challenges exist in the study of AVC
datasets. These include seasonality of animal activity, unknown exposure (i.e.,
the number of animal crossings), very low AVC counts across most sections of
extensive roadway networks, and computational burdens that come with discrete
response analysis using large datasets. To overcome these challenges, a
Bayesian hierarchical model is proposed where the exposure is modeled with
nonparametric Dirichlet process, and the number of segment-level AVCs is
assumed to follow a Binomial distribution. A P\'olya-Gamma augmented Gibbs
sampler is derived to estimate the proposed model. By using the AVC data of
multiple years across about 100,000 segments of state-controlled highways in
Texas, U.S., it is demonstrated that the model is scalable to large datasets,
with a preponderance of zeros and clear monthly seasonality in counts, while
identifying high-risk locations (for application of design treatments, like
separated animal crossings with fencing) and key explanatory factors based on
segment-specific factors (such as changes in speed limit) can be done within
the modelling framework, which provide useful information for policy-making

which achievable rates are shown that depend on the realized actions of the
adversary. Specifically, rateless codes are constructed which require a limited
amount of common randomness. These codes are constructed for two kinds of AVC
models. In the first the channel state cannot depend on the channel input, and
in the second it can. As a byproduct, the randomized coding capacity of the AVC

prior as a sequential universal prediction problem, that attempts to approach a
given target rate, which depends on the unknown channel sequence. The main
result is that, for a channel comprised of an unknown, arbitrary sequence of
memoryless channels, there is a system using feedback and common randomness
that asymptotically attains, with high probability, the capacity of the
time-averaged channel, universally for every sequence of channels. While no
prior knowledge of the channel sequence is assumed, the rate achieved meets or
exceeds the traditional arbitrarily varying channel (AVC) capacity for every
memoryless AVC defined over the same alphabets, and therefore the system
universally attains the random code AVC capacity, without knowledge of the AVC
parameters. The system we present combines rateless coding with a universal
prediction scheme for the prior. We present rough upper bounds on the rates

152,The Arbitrarily Varying Channel with Colored Gaussian Noise,"We address the arbitrarily varying channel (AVC) with colored Gaussian noise.
The work consists of three parts. First, we study the general discrete AVC with
fixed parameters, where the channel depends on two state sequences, one
arbitrary and the other fixed and known. This model can be viewed as a
combination of the AVC and the time-varying channel. We determine both the
deterministic code capacity and the random code capacity. Super-additivity is
demonstrated, showing that the deterministic code capacity can be strictly
larger than the weighted sum of the parametric capacities.
  In the second part, we consider the arbitrarily varying Gaussian product
channel (AVGPC). Hughes and Narayan characterized the random code capacity
through min-max optimization leading to a ""double"" water filling solution.
Here, we establish the deterministic code capacity and also discuss the
game-theoretic meaning and the connection between double water filling and Nash
equilibrium. As in the case of the standard Gaussian AVC, the deterministic
code capacity is discontinuous in the input constraint, and depends on which of
the input or state constraint is higher. As opposed to Shannon's classic water
filling solution, it is observed that deterministic coding using independent
scalar codes is suboptimal for the AVGPC.
  Finally, we establish the capacity of the AVC with colored Gaussian noise,
where double water filling is performed in the frequency domain. The analysis
relies on our preceding results, on the AVC with fixed parameters and the
AVGPC.",1901.00929v3,cs.IT,2019-01-03 22:35:34+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Uzi Pereg'), arxiv.Result.Author('Yossef Steinberg')]",

overhead than conventional routing protocols such as AODV. However, the
performance of these protocols is impacted by physical voids, and localization
errors. Accordingly, virtual coordinate systems (VCS) were proposed as an
alternative approach that is resilient to localization errors and that
naturally routes around physical voids. However, we show that VCS is vulnerable
to different forms of the void problem and the performance of greedy routing on
VCS is worse than that of geographic forwarding. We show that these anomalies
are due to the integral nature of VCS, which causes quantization noise in the
estimate of connectivity and node location. We propose an aligned virtual
coordinate system (AVCS) on which the greedy routing success can be
significantly improved. With our approach, and for the first time, we show that
greedy routing on VCS out-performs that on physical coordinate systems even in
the absence of localization errors. We compare AVCS against some of the most
popular geographical routing protocols both on physical coordinate system and
the virtual coordinate systems and show that AVCS significantly improves
performance over the best known solutions.",cs/0605089v1,cs.NI,2006-05-20 04:50:09+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Ke Liu'), arxiv.Result.Author('Nael Abu-Ghazaleh')]",MASS 2006

symmetrizability and do not coincide in general. An example is given that shows
that for list size $L$ the capacity may be positive but strictly smaller than

private randomness between the transmitter and the receiver. This is in
contrast to similar AVC models under the average probability of error criterion
considered in [1], and models wherein common randomness is allowed [2] -- these
distinctions are important in some communication scenarios outlined below.
  We consider the regime where the jammer's power constraint is smaller than
the transmitter's power constraint (in the other regime it is known no positive
rate is possible). For this regime we show the existence of stochastic codes
(with no common randomness between the transmitter and receiver) that enables
reliable communication at the same rate as when the jammer is replaced with
AWGN with the same power constraint. This matches known information-theoretic
outer bounds. In addition to being a stronger result than that in [1] (enabling
recovery of the results therein), our proof techniques are also somewhat more

157,Reliable Communication under the Influence of a State-Constrained Jammer: A Novel Perspective on Receive Diversity,"The question of robust direct communication in vehicular networks is
discussed. In most state-of-the-art approaches, there is no central entity
controlling channel access, so there may be arbitrary interference from other
parties. Thus, a suitable channel model for Vehicle-to-X (V2X) communication is
the Arbitrarily Varying Channel (AVC). Employing multiple antennas on a vehicle
or sending over multiple frequencies to make use of diversity are promising
approaches to combat interference. In this setup, an important question about
diversity is how many antennas or orthogonal carrier frequencies are necessary
in order to avoid system breakdown due to unknown interference in AVCs. For
Binary Symmetric AVCs (AVBSC) and a physically meaningful identical
state-constrained jammer, the deployment of a third, uncorrelated receiving
antenna or the parallel transmission over three different orthogonal
frequencies avoids symmetrizability and thus ensures positivity of the capacity
of the overall communication channel. Furthermore, the capacity of the
identical state-constrained composite AVBSC is continuous and shows
super-activation, a phenomenon which was hitherto deemed impossible for
classical communication without secrecy constraints. Subsuming, spatial and
frequency diversity are enablers for reliable communication over communication
channels with arbitrarily varying interference.",1710.10811v1,cs.IT,2017-10-30 09:04:52+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Christian Arendt'), arxiv.Result.Author('Janis Nötzel'), arxiv.Result.Author('Holger Boche')]",

known converse bound, is used to derive bounds on the dispersion of discrete
memoryless AVCs without shared randomness, and with cost constraints on the
input and the state. These bounds are tight for many channels of interest,

transitivity and agreement information of auxiliary verb constructions (AVCs)
in comparison to finite main verbs (FMVs). This comparison is motivated by
theoretical work in dependency grammar and in particular the work of Tesni\`ere
(1959) where AVCs and FMVs are both instances of a nucleus, the basic unit of
syntax. An AVC is a dissociated nucleus, it consists of at least two words, and
an FMV is its non-dissociated counterpart, consisting of exactly one word. We
suggest that the representation of AVCs and FMVs should capture similar
information. We use diagnostic classifiers to probe agreement and transitivity
information in vectors learned by a transition-based neural parser in four
typologically different languages. We find that the parser learns different
information about AVCs and FMVs if only sequential models (BiLSTMs) are used in
the architecture but similar information when a recursive layer is used. We
find explanations for why this is the case by looking closely at how
information is learned in the network and looking at what happens with
different dependency representations of AVCs. We conclude that there may be
benefits to using a recursive layer in dependency parsing and that we have not
yet found the best way to integrate it in our parsers.",1907.07950v2,cs.CL,2019-07-18 09:37:38+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Miryam de Lhoneux'), arxiv.Result.Author('Sara Stymne'), arxiv.Result.Author('Joakim Nivre')]",
167,Modelling Animal-Vehicle Collision Counts across Large Networks Using a Bayesian Hierarchical Model with Time-Varying Parameters,"Animal-vehicle collisions (AVCs) are common around the world and result in
considerable loss of animal and human life, as well as significant property
damage and regular insurance claims. Understanding their occurrence in relation
to various contributing factors and being able to identify locations of high
risk are valuable to AVC prevention, yielding economic, social and
environmental cost savings. However, many challenges exist in the study of AVC
datasets. These include seasonality of animal activity, unknown exposure (i.e.,
the number of animal crossings), very low AVC counts across most sections of
extensive roadway networks, and computational burdens that come with discrete
response analysis using large datasets. To overcome these challenges, a
Bayesian hierarchical model is proposed where the exposure is modeled with
nonparametric Dirichlet process, and the number of segment-level AVCs is
assumed to follow a Binomial distribution. A P\'olya-Gamma augmented Gibbs
sampler is derived to estimate the proposed model. By using the AVC data of
multiple years across about 100,000 segments of state-controlled highways in
Texas, U.S., it is demonstrated that the model is scalable to large datasets,
with a preponderance of zeros and clear monthly seasonality in counts, while
identifying high-risk locations (for application of design treatments, like
separated animal crossings with fencing) and key explanatory factors based on
segment-specific factors (such as changes in speed limit) can be done within
the modelling framework, which provide useful information for policy-making
purposes.",2104.02289v2,stat.AP,2021-04-06 05:05:11+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Krishna Murthy Gurumurthy'), arxiv.Result.Author('Zili Li'), arxiv.Result.Author('Kara M. Kockelman'), arxiv.Result.Author('Prateek Bansal')]",

selected maliciously by an adversary. Fixed-blocklength coding assumes a
worst-case bound on the adversary's capabilities, which leads to pessimistic
results. This paper defines a variable-length perspective on this problem, for
which achievable rates are shown that depend on the realized actions of the
adversary. Specifically, rateless codes are constructed which require a limited
amount of common randomness. These codes are constructed for two kinds of AVC
models. In the first the channel state cannot depend on the channel input, and
in the second it can. As a byproduct, the randomized coding capacity of the AVC
with state depending on the transmitted codeword is found and shown to be
achievable with a small amount of common randomness. The results for this model
are proved using a randomized strategy based on list decoding.",0711.3926v4,cs.IT,2007-11-25 22:39:24+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Anand D. Sarwate'), arxiv.Result.Author('Michael Gastpar')]",

determining the input behavior, and specifically, a prior distribution which is
used to randomly generate the codebook. We pose the problem of setting the
prior as a sequential universal prediction problem, that attempts to approach a
given target rate, which depends on the unknown channel sequence. The main
result is that, for a channel comprised of an unknown, arbitrary sequence of
memoryless channels, there is a system using feedback and common randomness
that asymptotically attains, with high probability, the capacity of the
time-averaged channel, universally for every sequence of channels. While no
prior knowledge of the channel sequence is assumed, the rate achieved meets or
exceeds the traditional arbitrarily varying channel (AVC) capacity for every
memoryless AVC defined over the same alphabets, and therefore the system
universally attains the random code AVC capacity, without knowledge of the AVC
parameters. The system we present combines rateless coding with a universal
prediction scheme for the prior. We present rough upper bounds on the rates
that can be achieved in this setting and lower bounds for the redundancies.",1102.0710v3,cs.IT,2011-02-03 15:49:36+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Yuval Lomnitz'), arxiv.Result.Author('Meir Feder')]",
170,The Arbitrarily Varying Channel with Colored Gaussian Noise,"We address the arbitrarily varying channel (AVC) with colored Gaussian noise.
The work consists of three parts. First, we study the general discrete AVC with
fixed parameters, where the channel depends on two state sequences, one
arbitrary and the other fixed and known. This model can be viewed as a
combination of the AVC and the time-varying channel. We determine both the
deterministic code capacity and the random code capacity. Super-additivity is
demonstrated, showing that the deterministic code capacity can be strictly
larger than the weighted sum of the parametric capacities.
  In the second part, we consider the arbitrarily varying Gaussian product
channel (AVGPC). Hughes and Narayan characterized the random code capacity
through min-max optimization leading to a ""double"" water filling solution.
Here, we establish the deterministic code capacity and also discuss the
game-theoretic meaning and the connection between double water filling and Nash
equilibrium. As in the case of the standard Gaussian AVC, the deterministic
code capacity is discontinuous in the input constraint, and depends on which of
the input or state constraint is higher. As opposed to Shannon's classic water
filling solution, it is observed that deterministic coding using independent
scalar codes is suboptimal for the AVGPC.
  Finally, we establish the capacity of the AVC with colored Gaussian noise,
where double water filling is performed in the frequency domain. The analysis
relies on our preceding results, on the AVC with fixed parameters and the
AVGPC.",1901.00929v3,cs.IT,2019-01-03 22:35:34+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Uzi Pereg'), arxiv.Result.Author('Yossef Steinberg')]",

additive white Gaussian state, where the state is known non-causally to the
encoder and the adversary, but not the decoder. We determine the randomized
coding capacity of this AVC under the maximal probability of error criterion.
Interestingly, it is shown that the jamming adversary disregards the state

172,Aligned Virtual Coordinates for Greedy Routing in WSNs,"Geographic routing provides relatively good performance at a much lower
overhead than conventional routing protocols such as AODV. However, the
performance of these protocols is impacted by physical voids, and localization
errors. Accordingly, virtual coordinate systems (VCS) were proposed as an
alternative approach that is resilient to localization errors and that
naturally routes around physical voids. However, we show that VCS is vulnerable
to different forms of the void problem and the performance of greedy routing on
VCS is worse than that of geographic forwarding. We show that these anomalies
are due to the integral nature of VCS, which causes quantization noise in the
estimate of connectivity and node location. We propose an aligned virtual
coordinate system (AVCS) on which the greedy routing success can be
significantly improved. With our approach, and for the first time, we show that
greedy routing on VCS out-performs that on physical coordinate systems even in
the absence of localization errors. We compare AVCS against some of the most
popular geographical routing protocols both on physical coordinate system and
the virtual coordinate systems and show that AVCS significantly improves
performance over the best known solutions.",cs/0605089v1,cs.NI,2006-05-20 04:50:09+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Ke Liu'), arxiv.Result.Author('Nael Abu-Ghazaleh')]",MASS 2006

maximal error with list decoding using lists of size $O(1/\epsilon)$. Under
average error an achievable rate region and converse bound are given for lists
of size $L$. These bounds are based on two different notions of
symmetrizability and do not coincide in general. An example is given that shows
that for list size $L$ the capacity may be positive but strictly smaller than
the randomized coding capacity. This behavior is different than the situation
without state constraints.",cs/0701146v3,cs.IT,2007-01-24 01:59:37+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Anand D. Sarwate'), arxiv.Result.Author('Michael Gastpar')]",

private randomness between the transmitter and the receiver. This is in
contrast to similar AVC models under the average probability of error criterion
considered in [1], and models wherein common randomness is allowed [2] -- these
distinctions are important in some communication scenarios outlined below.
  We consider the regime where the jammer's power constraint is smaller than
the transmitter's power constraint (in the other regime it is known no positive
rate is possible). For this regime we show the existence of stochastic codes
(with no common randomness between the transmitter and receiver) that enables
reliable communication at the same rate as when the jammer is replaced with
AWGN with the same power constraint. This matches known information-theoretic
outer bounds. In addition to being a stronger result than that in [1] (enabling
recovery of the results therein), our proof techniques are also somewhat more
direct, and hence may be of independent interest.",1301.6345v1,cs.IT,2013-01-27 11:19:21+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Farzin Haddadpour'), arxiv.Result.Author('Mahdi Jafari Siavoshani'), arxiv.Result.Author('Mayank Bakshi'), arxiv.Result.Author('Sidharth Jaggi')]",
175,Reliable Communication under the Influence of a State-Constrained Jammer: A Novel Perspective on Receive Diversity,"The question of robust direct communication in vehicular networks is
discussed. In most state-of-the-art approaches, there is no central entity
controlling channel access, so there may be arbitrary interference from other
parties. Thus, a suitable channel model for Vehicle-to-X (V2X) communication is
the Arbitrarily Varying Channel (AVC). Employing multiple antennas on a vehicle
or sending over multiple frequencies to make use of diversity are promising
approaches to combat interference. In this setup, an important question about
diversity is how many antennas or orthogonal carrier frequencies are necessary
in order to avoid system breakdown due to unknown interference in AVCs. For
Binary Symmetric AVCs (AVBSC) and a physically meaningful identical
state-constrained jammer, the deployment of a third, uncorrelated receiving
antenna or the parallel transmission over three different orthogonal
frequencies avoids symmetrizability and thus ensures positivity of the capacity
of the overall communication channel. Furthermore, the capacity of the
identical state-constrained composite AVBSC is continuous and shows
super-activation, a phenomenon which was hitherto deemed impossible for
classical communication without secrecy constraints. Subsuming, spatial and
frequency diversity are enablers for reliable communication over communication
channels with arbitrarily varying interference.",1710.10811v1,cs.IT,2017-10-30 09:04:52+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Christian Arendt'), arxiv.Result.Author('Janis Nötzel'), arxiv.Result.Author('Holger Boche')]",

bound for non-adversarial channels. This finite blocklength bound, along with a
known converse bound, is used to derive bounds on the dispersion of discrete
memoryless AVCs without shared randomness, and with cost constraints on the
input and the state. These bounds are tight for many channels of interest,
including the binary symmetric AVC. However, the bounds are not tight if the

assume two types of voters. Unbiased voters whose confidence is indifferent to
the state of the voter and biased voters whose confidence is biased towards a
common fixed preferred state. We study the problem analytically on the complete
graph using mean field theory and on an Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi random network
topology using the pair approximation, where we assume that the network of
interactions topology is independent of the type of voters. We find that for
the case of a random initial setup, and for sufficiently large number of voters

$\gamma$ the fraction of biased voters and $v$ the parameter quantifying the
bias of the voters ($v=0$ no bias). We verify our analytical results through
numerical simulations. We study this model on a biased-dependent topology of
the network of interactions and examine two distinct, global average-degree
preserving strategies (model I and model II) to obtain such biased-dependent
random topologies starting from the biased-independent random topology case as
the initial setup. Keeping all other parameters constant, in model I,
$\mu_{BU}$, the average number of links among biased (B) and unbiased (U)
voters is varied at the expense of $\mu_{UU}$ and $\mu_{BB}$, i.e. the average
number of links among only unbiased and biased voters respectively. In model
II, $\mu_{BU}$ is kept constant, while $\mu_{BB}$ is varied at the expense of
$\mu_{UU}$. We find that if the agents follow the strategy described by model

voters whose state can change upon a single contact with a different
neighboring opinion. However, confidence increases with opinion reinforcement
and, above a certain threshold, these agents become zealots that do not change
opinion. We show that both strategies, normal voters and zealots, may coexist,
leading to a competition between two different kinetic mechanisms:
curvature-driven growth and interfacial noise. The kinetically constrained
zealots are formed well inside the clusters, away from the different opinions
at the surfaces that help keep the confidence not so high. Normal voters
concentrate in a region around the interfaces and their number, that is related
with the distance between the surface and the zealotry bulk, depends on the
rate the confidence changes. Despite this interface being rough and fragmented,
typical of the voter model, the presence of zealots in the bulk of these
domains, induces a curvature-driven dynamics, similar to the low temperature

ensures the integrity of the voter's real credential while enabling the
creation of fake credentials using interactive zero-knowledge proofs between
the voter as the verifier and the kiosk as the prover, unbeknownst to the

and cannot leave the booth with a real credential, can delegate their vote to a
political party, with the caveat that they must then trust the kiosk. TRIP
optimizes the tallying process by limiting the number of credentials a voter
can receive and capping the number of votes that a credential can cast per

time-varying abilities of individuals to influence their neighbors. To
understand of the RVM, we first discuss the fitness voter model (FVM), in which
each voter has a fixed and distinct fitness. In a voting event where voter $i$
is fitter than voter $j$, only $j$ changes opinion. We show that the dynamics
of the FVM and the voter model are identical. We next discuss the adaptive
voter model (AVM), in which the influencing voter in a voting event increases
its fitness by a fixed amount. The dynamics of the AVM is non-stationary and
slowly crosses over to that of FVM because of the gradual broadening of the
fitness distribution of the population. Finally, we treat the RVM, in which the
voter $i$ is endowed with a reputational rank $r_i$ that ranges from 1 (highest
rank) to $N$ (lowest), where $N$ is the population size. In a voting event in
which voter $i$ outranks $j$, only the opinion of $j$ changes. Concomitantly,
the rank of $i$ increases, while that of $j$ does not change. The rank
distribution remains uniform on the integers $1,2,3,\ldots,N$, leading to
stationary dynamics. For equal number of voters in the two voting states with
these two subpopulations having the same average rand, the time to reach
consensus in the mean-field limit scales as $\exp(\sqrt{N})$. This long
consensus time arises because the average rank of the minority population is
typically higher than that of the majority. Thus whenever consensus is
approached, this highly ranked minority tends to drive the population away from
consensus.",1902.09371v2,physics.soc-ph,2019-02-22 18:19:16+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('D. Bhat'), arxiv.Result.Author('S. Redner')]",J. Stat. Mech. (2019) 063208

models trained on early printed books: (1) The pretraining method utilizes the
information stored in already existing models trained on a variety of typesets

cross fold training on a single set of ground truth data (line images and their
transcriptions) with a single OCR engine (OCRopus) produces a committee whose
members then vote for the best outcome by also taking the top-N alternatives
and their intrinsic confidence values into account. (3) Following the principle
of maximal disagreement we select additional training lines which the voters
disagree most on, expecting them to offer the highest information gain for a
subsequent training (active learning). Evaluations on six early printed books
yielded the following results: On average the combination of pretraining and
voting improved the character accuracy by 46% when training five folds starting
from the same mixed model. This number rose to 53% when using different models
for pretraining, underlining the importance of diverse voters. Incorporating
active learning improved the obtained results by another 16% on average
(evaluated on three of the six books). Overall, the proposed methods lead to an

with an individual inertia to change their opinion. This inertia depends on the
persistence time of a voter's current opinion (ageing). We focus on the case of
only two different inertia values: zero if a voter just changed towards a new
opinion and $\nu$ otherwise. We are interested in the average time to reach
consensus, i.e. the state in which all voters have adopted the same opinion.
Adding inertia to the system means to slow down the dynamics at the voter's
level, which should presumably lead to a slower consensus formation. As an
unexpected outcome of our inertial voter dynamics, there is a parameter region
of $\nu$ where an increasing inertia leads to a faster consensus formation.
These results rest on the heterogeneity of voters which evolves through the
described ageing. In a control setting of homogeneous inertia values, we only
find monotonously increasing consensus times. In the paper, we present
dynamical equations for the mean-field case which allow for analytical insight

individual voters are also influenced by two opposing, fixed-opinion news
sources. These sources forestall consensus and instead drive the population to
a politically polarized state, with roughly half the population in each opinion
state. Two types social networks for the voters are studied: (a) the complete
graph of $N$ voters and, more realistically, (b) the two-clique graph with $N$
voters in each clique. For the complete graph, many dynamical properties are
soluble within an annealed-link approximation, in which a link between a news
source and a voter is replaced by an average link density. In this
approximation, we show that the average consensus time grows as $N^\alpha$,
with $\alpha = p\ell/(1-p)$. Here $p$ is the probability that a voter consults

189,Voter model under stochastic resetting,"The voter model is a toy model of consensus formation based on
nearest-neighbour interactions. Each voter is endowed with a Boolean variable
(a binary opinion) that flips randomly at a rate set according to the opinions
of the nearest neighbours. In this paper we subject the system to local
resetting by considering stubborn voters. In addition to the usual dynamics,
voters revert independently to their initial opinion according to a Poisson
process of fixed intensity. The resulting kinetic equations for the average
magnetization and two-point function of the model are derived and solved in
closed form. They are formally identical to the heat equation coupled to a
thermostat, whose temperature profile is induced by the initial conditions. In
the case of initial conditions consisting of a single decided voter at the
origin in a environment full of undecided voters, the average magnetization
evolves as the probability density of a random walker with stochastic resetting
to the origin. However, the long-time behaviour of the two-point function
contains terms terms that cannot be obtained from a renewal argument. As a
result, the steady-state density of domain walls can be minimized as a function
of the resetting rate.",2207.08590v2,cond-mat.stat-mech,2022-07-18 13:30:53+00:00,[arxiv.Result.Author('Pascal Grange')],

two opinions and can additionally have two levels of commitment to an opinion
--- confident and unsure. Upon interacting with an agent of a different
opinion, a confident voter becomes less committed, or unsure, but does not
change opinion. However, an unsure agent changes opinion by interacting with an
agent of a different opinion. In the mean-field limit, a population of size N
is quickly driven to a mixed state and remains close to this state before
consensus is eventually achieved in a time of the order of ln N. In two
dimensions, the distribution of consensus times is characterized by two
distinct times --- one that scales linearly with N and another that appears to
scale as N^{3/2}. The longer time arises from configurations that fall into
long-lived states that consist of two (or more) single-opinion stripes before
consensus is reached. These stripe states arise from an effective surface
tension between domains of different opinions.",1111.3883v2,physics.soc-ph,2011-11-16 17:43:59+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('D. Volovik'), arxiv.Result.Author('S. Redner')]",J. Stat. Mech. P04003 (2012)

processes that describe the spread of opinions on networks. The former includes
social influence, the tendency of individuals to become more similar when they
interact, while the latter also accounts for homophily, the tendency to
interact more frequently with individuals which are more similar. The Axelrod
model has been extensively studied during the past ten years based on numerical
simulations. In contrast, we give rigorous analytical results for a
generalization of the voter model that is closely related to the Axelrod model
as it combines social influence and confidence threshold, which is modeled
somewhat similarly to homophily. Each vertex of the network, represented by a
finite connected graph, is characterized by an opinion and may interact with
its adjacent vertices. Like the voter model, an interaction results in an
agreement between both interacting vertices -- social influence -- but unlike
the voter model, an interaction takes place if and only if the vertices'
opinions are within a certain distance -- confidence threshold. In a
deterministic static approach, we first give lower and upper bounds for the
maximum number of opinions that can be supported by the network as a function
of the confidence threshold and various characteristics of the graph. The
number of opinions coexisting at equilibrium is then investigated in a
probabilistic dynamic approach for the stochastic process starting from a
random configuration ...",1003.0115v2,math.PR,2010-02-27 17:00:08+00:00,[arxiv.Result.Author('Nicolas Lanchier')],
195,Risk-Limiting Tallies,"Many voter-verifiable, coercion-resistant schemes have been proposed, but
even the most carefully designed systems necessarily leak information via the
announced result. In corner cases, this may be problematic. For example, if all
the votes go to one candidate then all vote privacy evaporates. The mere
possibility of candidates getting no or few votes could have implications for
security in practice: if a coercer demands that a voter cast a vote for such an
unpopular candidate, then the voter may feel obliged to obey, even if she is
confident that the voting system satisfies the standard coercion resistance
definitions. With complex ballots, there may also be a danger of ""Italian""
style (aka ""signature"") attacks: the coercer demands the voter cast a ballot
with a specific, identifying pattern. Here we propose an approach to tallying
end-to-end verifiable schemes that avoids revealing all the votes but still
achieves whatever confidence level in the announced result is desired. Now a
coerced voter can claim that the required vote must be amongst those that
remained shrouded. Our approach is based on the well-established notion of
Risk-Limiting Audits, but here applied to the tally rather than to the audit.
We show that this approach counters coercion threats arising in extreme tallies
and ""Italian"" attacks. We illustrate our approach by applying it to the Selene
scheme, and we extend the approach to Risk-Limiting Verification, where not all
vote trackers are revealed, thereby enhancing the coercion mitigation
properties of Selene.",1908.04947v1,cs.CR,2019-08-14 04:23:10+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Wojciech Jamroga'), arxiv.Result.Author('Peter B. Roenne'), arxiv.Result.Author('Peter Y. A. Ryan'), arxiv.Result.Author('Philip B. Stark')]",

link-update dynamics the average magnetization is still conserved. For the
particular case of a Barabasi-Albert scale-free network the voter model
dynamics leads to a partially ordered metastable state with a finite size
survival time. This characteristic time scales linearly with system size only
when the updating rule respects the conservation law of the average
magnetization. This scaling identifies a universal or generic property of the

person (classifier) votes on every issue. This fails when the average voter
competence (classifier accuracy) falls below 50%, which can happen in noisy
settings where voters have only limited information, or when there are multiple
topics and the average voter competence may not be high enough for some topics.
Representative democracy, where voters choose representatives to vote, can be
an elixir in both these situations. Representative democracy is a specific way
to improve the ensemble of classifiers. We introduce a mathematical model for
studying representative democracy, in particular understanding the parameters
of a representative democracy that gives maximum decision making capability.
Our main result states that under general and natural conditions,
  1. Representative democracy can make the correct decisions simultaneously for
multiple noisy issues.
  2. When the cost of voting is fixed, the optimal representative democracy
requires that representatives are elected from constant sized groups: the
number of representatives should be linear in the number of voters.
  3. When the cost and benefit of voting are both polynomial, the optimal group
size is close to linear in the number of voters. This work sets the
mathematical foundation for studying the quality-quantity tradeoff in a
representative democracy-type ensemble (fewer highly qualified representatives
versus more less qualified representatives).",1807.06157v1,cs.GT,2018-07-17 00:09:53+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Malik Magdon-Ismail'), arxiv.Result.Author('Lirong Xia')]",

representation. This makes these indices representation-compatible, a property
not fulfilled by classical power indices. Average representations can be

on two parameters: the number of opinions denoted by $F$ and a so-called
confidence threshold denoted by $\theta$. If the opinion distance between two
interacting agents exceeds the confidence threshold then nothing happens,
otherwise one of the two agents mimics the other one just as in the classical
voter model. Our main result shows that the one-dimensional system starting
from any product measures with a positive density of each opinion fluctuates

202,Content Distribution by Multiple Multicast Trees and Intersession Cooperation: Optimal Algorithms and Approximations,"In traditional massive content distribution with multiple sessions, the
sessions form separate overlay networks and operate independently, where some
sessions may suffer from insufficient resources even though other sessions have
excessive resources. To cope with this problem, we consider the universal
swarming approach, which allows multiple sessions to cooperate with each other.
We formulate the problem of finding the optimal resource allocation to maximize
the sum of the session utilities and present a subgradient algorithm which
converges to the optimal solution in the time-average sense. The solution
involves an NP-hard subproblem of finding a minimum-cost Steiner tree. We cope
with this difficulty by using a column generation method, which reduces the
number of Steiner-tree computations. Furthermore, we allow the use of
approximate solutions to the Steiner-tree subproblem. We show that the
approximation ratio to the overall problem turns out to be no less than the
reciprocal of the approximation ratio to the Steiner-tree subproblem.
Simulation results demonstrate that universal swarming improves the performance
of resource-poor sessions with negligible impact to resource-rich sessions. The
proposed approach and algorithm are expected to be useful for
infrastructure-based content distribution networks with long-lasting sessions

on a set of films chosen to mitigate effects of bias due to the language and
country of origin of films. We show that production budget, box office gross,
and total number of user votes for films are consistent with double-log normal
distributions for certain time periods. Both total gross and user votes are
consistent with a double-log normal distribution from the late 1980s onward,
while for budget, it extends from 1935 to 1979. In addition, we find a strong
correlation between number of user votes and the economic statistics,
particularly budget. Remarkably, we find no evidence for a correlation between
number of votes and average user rating. As previous studies have found a

transmissions in an efficient and fair manner. In this paper, a novel
distributed node scheduling algorithm, called Local Voting, is proposed. This
algorithm tries to semi-equalize the load (defined as the ratio of the queue
length over the number of allocated slots) through slot reallocation based on
local information exchange. The algorithm stems from the finding that the
shortest delivery time or delay is obtained when the load is semi-equalized
throughout the network. In addition, we prove that, with Local Voting, the
network system converges asymptotically towards the optimal scheduling.
Moreover, through extensive simulations, the performance of Local Voting is
further investigated in comparison with several representative scheduling
algorithms from the literature. Simulation results show that the proposed
algorithm achieves better performance than the other distributed algorithms in
terms of average delay, maximum delay, and fairness. Despite being distributed,

characterized by a 5-tuple (S, D, R, Peak R, Initiation T)=(total payload,
duration, average transmission rate, peak transmission rate, initiation time).
After careful consideration, a new definition of peak rate is required. Unlike
Sarvotham et al. [2005] who segmented sessions into two groups labelled alpha
and beta, we segment into 10 sessions according to the empirical quantiles of
the peak rate variable as a demonstration that the beta group is far from
homogeneous. Our more refined segmentation reveals additional structure that is
missed by segmentation into two groups. In each segment, we study the
dependence structure of (S, D, R) and find that it varies across the groups.
Furthermore, within each segment, session initiation times are well
approximated by a Poisson process whereas this property does not hold for the
data set taken as a whole. Therefore, we conclude that the peak rate level is
important for understanding structure and for constructing accurate simulations

time-varying abilities of individuals to influence their neighbors. To
understand of the RVM, we first discuss the fitness voter model (FVM), in which
each voter has a fixed and distinct fitness. In a voting event where voter $i$
is fitter than voter $j$, only $j$ changes opinion. We show that the dynamics
of the FVM and the voter model are identical. We next discuss the adaptive
voter model (AVM), in which the influencing voter in a voting event increases
its fitness by a fixed amount. The dynamics of the AVM is non-stationary and
slowly crosses over to that of FVM because of the gradual broadening of the
fitness distribution of the population. Finally, we treat the RVM, in which the
voter $i$ is endowed with a reputational rank $r_i$ that ranges from 1 (highest

which voter $i$ outranks $j$, only the opinion of $j$ changes. Concomitantly,
the rank of $i$ increases, while that of $j$ does not change. The rank
distribution remains uniform on the integers $1,2,3,\ldots,N$, leading to
stationary dynamics. For equal number of voters in the two voting states with
these two subpopulations having the same average rand, the time to reach
consensus in the mean-field limit scales as $\exp(\sqrt{N})$. This long
consensus time arises because the average rank of the minority population is
typically higher than that of the majority. Thus whenever consensus is

213,Modelling Sequential Music Track Skips using a Multi-RNN Approach,"Modelling sequential music skips provides streaming companies the ability to
better understand the needs of the user base, resulting in a better user
experience by reducing the need to manually skip certain music tracks. This
paper describes the solution of the University of Copenhagen DIKU-IR team in
the 'Spotify Sequential Skip Prediction Challenge', where the task was to
predict the skip behaviour of the second half in a music listening session
conditioned on the first half. We model this task using a Multi-RNN approach
consisting of two distinct stacked recurrent neural networks, where one network
focuses on encoding the first half of the session and the other network focuses
on utilizing the encoding to make sequential skip predictions. The encoder
network is initialized by a learned session-wide music encoding, and both of
them utilize a learned track embedding. Our final model consists of a majority
voted ensemble of individually trained models, and ranked 2nd out of 45

214,Designing Stable Elections: A Survey,"We survey the design of elections that are resilient to attempted
interference by third parties. For example, suppose votes have been cast in an
election between two candidates, and then each vote is randomly changed with a
small probability, independently of the other votes. It is desirable to keep
the outcome of the election the same, regardless of the changes to the votes.
It is well known that the US electoral college system is about 5 times more
likely to have a changed outcome due to vote corruption, when compared to a
majority vote. In fact, Mossel, O'Donnell and Oleszkiewicz proved in 2005 that
the majority voting method is most stable to this random vote corruption, among
voting methods where each person has a small influence on the election. We
discuss some recent progress on the analogous result for elections between more
than two candidates. In this case, plurality should be most stable to
corruption in votes. We also survey results on adversarial election
manipulation (where an adversary can select particular votes to change, perhaps
in a non-random way), and we briefly discuss ranked choice voting methods
(where a vote is a ranked list of candidates).",2006.05460v2,math.PR,2020-06-09 18:59:48+00:00,[arxiv.Result.Author('Steven Heilman')],

Multi-choice Voting/Ranking (DMVR) algorithm to determine either the choice
with maximum vote (the voting problem) or to rank all the choices in terms of
their acquired votes (the ranking problem). The algorithm consolidates node
votes across the network by updating the states of interacting nodes using two
key operations, the union and the intersection. The proposed algorithm is
simple, independent from network size, and easily scalable in terms of the
number of choices $K$, using only $K\times 2^{K-1}$ nodal states for voting,
and $K\times K!$ nodal states for ranking. We prove the number of states to be
optimal in the ranking case, this optimality is conjectured to also apply to
the voting case. The time complexity of the algorithm is analyzed in complete
graphs. We show that the time complexity for both ranking and voting is
$O(\log(n))$ for given vote percentages, and is inversely proportional to the
minimum of the vote percentage differences among various choices.",1703.08838v1,cs.DC,2017-03-26 16:19:31+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Saber Salehkaleybar'), arxiv.Result.Author('Arsalan Sharif-Nassab'), arxiv.Result.Author('S. Jamaloddin Golestani')]",

quickness of large network dynamics is usually quantified by the length of
transient paths, an analytically intractable measure. For discrete-time
dynamics of networks of binary elements, we address this dilemma with an
alternative unified framework by using a concept termed state concentration,
defined as the exponent of the average number of t-step ancestors in state
transition graphs. The state transition graph is defined by nodes corresponding
to network states and directed links corresponding to transitions. Using this
exponent, we interrogate the dynamics of random Boolean and majority vote

permanent members of the council can use their veto power against any
unfavorable decision taken by the council. In certain situation, a member using
right to veto may prefer to remain anonymous. This need leads to the
requirement of the protocols for anonymous veto which can be viewed as a
special type of voting. Recently, a few protocols for quantum anonymous veto
have been designed which clearly show quantum advantages in ensuring anonymity
of the veto. However, none of the efficient protocols for quantum anonymous
veto have yet been experimentally realized. Here, we implement 2 of those
protocols for quantum anonymous veto using an IBM quantum computer named IBMQ
Casablanca and different quantum resources like Bell, GHZ and cluster states.
In this set of proof-of-principle experiments, it's observed that using the
present technology, a protocol for quantum anonymous veto can be realized
experimentally if the number of people who can veto remains small as in the
case of UN council. Further, it's observed that Bell state based protocol
implemented here performs better than the GHZ/cluster state based
implementation of the other protocol in an ideal scenario as well as in
presence of different types of noise (amplitude damping, phase damping,

decoherence rate. In addition, a trade-off between correctness and robustness
of the probabilistic QAV schemes is observed. Further, the multipartite dense
coding based determinsitic QAV scheme is most efficient scheme among the set of

222,Computing the proportional veto core,"In social choice there often arises a conflict between the majority principle
(the search for a candidate that is as good as possible for as many voters as
possible), and the protection of minority rights (choosing a candidate that is
not overly bad for particular individuals or groups). In a context where the
latter is our main concern, veto-based rules -- giving individuals or groups
the ability to strike off certain candidates from the list -- are a natural and
effective way of ensuring that no minority is left with an outcome they find
untenable. However, such rules often fail to be anonymous, or impose specific
restrictions on the number of voters and candidates. These issues can be
addressed by considering the proportional veto core -- the solution to a
cooperative game where every coalition is given the power to veto a number of
candidates proportional to its size. However, the naive algorithm for the veto
core is exponential, and the only known rule for selecting from the core, with
an arbitrary number of voters, fails anonymity. In this paper we present a
polynomial time algorithm for computing the core and present an anonymous

224,Deep Learning-based Anonymization of Chest Radiographs: A Utility-preserving Measure for Patient Privacy,"Robust and reliable anonymization of chest radiographs constitutes an
essential step before publishing large datasets of such for research purposes.
The conventional anonymization process is carried out by obscuring personal
information in the images with black boxes and removing or replacing
meta-information. However, such simple measures retain biometric information in
the chest radiographs, allowing patients to be re-identified by a linkage
attack. Therefore, we see an urgent need to obfuscate the biometric information
appearing in the images. To the best of our knowledge, we propose the first
deep learning-based approach to targetedly anonymize chest radiographs while
maintaining data utility for diagnostic and machine learning purposes. Our
model architecture is a composition of three independent neural networks that,
when collectively used, allow for learning a deformation field that is able to
impede patient re-identification. The individual influence of each component is
investigated with an ablation study. Quantitative results on the ChestX-ray14
dataset show a reduction of patient re-identification from 81.8% to 58.6% in
the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) with little
impact on the abnormality classification performance. This indicates the
ability to preserve underlying abnormality patterns while increasing patient
privacy. Furthermore, we compare the proposed deep learning-based anonymization

  In this paper, we theoretically analyze the de-anonymization attacks and

providing a general theoretical guide for developing practical
de-anonymization/anonymization techniques.

237,On the Anonymity of Peer-To-Peer Network Anonymity Schemes Used by Cryptocurrencies,"Cryptocurrency systems can be subject to deanonimization attacks by
exploiting the network-level communication on their peer-to-peer network.
Adversaries who control a set of colluding node(s) within the peer-to-peer
network can observe transactions being exchanged and infer the parties
involved. Thus, various network anonymity schemes have been proposed to
mitigate this problem, with some solutions providing theoretical anonymity
guarantees.
  In this work, we model such peer-to-peer network anonymity solutions and
evaluate their anonymity guarantees. To do so, we propose a novel framework
that uses Bayesian inference to obtain the probability distributions linking
transactions to their possible originators. We characterize transaction
anonymity with those distributions, using entropy as metric of adversarial
uncertainty on the originator's identity. In particular, we model Dandelion,
Dandelion++ and Lightning Network. We study different configurations and
demonstrate that none of them offers acceptable anonymity to their users. For
instance, our analysis reveals that in the widely deployed Lightning Network,
with 1% strategically chosen colluding nodes the adversary can uniquely
determine the originator for about 50% of the total transactions in the
network. In Dandelion, an adversary that controls 15% of the nodes has on
average uncertainty among only 8 possible originators. Moreover, we observe
that due to the way Dandelion and Dandelion++ are designed, increasing the
network size does not correspond to an increase in the anonymity set of
potential originators. Alarmingly, our longitudinal analysis of Lightning
Network reveals rather an inverse trend -- with the growth of the network the
overall anonymity decreases.",2201.11860v4,cs.CR,2022-01-27 23:59:51+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Piyush Kumar Sharma'), arxiv.Result.Author('Devashish Gosain'), arxiv.Result.Author('Claudia Diaz')]",

phenomena such as information diffusion or network evolution. Yet the privacy
risks raised from sharing real graph datasets, even when stripped of user
identity information, are significant. Previous research shows that many graph
anonymization techniques fail against existing graph de-anonymization attacks.
However, the specific reason for the success of such de-anonymization attacks
is yet to be understood. This paper systematically studies the structural
properties of real graphs that make them more vulnerable to machine
learning-based techniques for de-anonymization. More precisely, we study the
boundaries of anonymity based on the structural properties of real graph
datasets in terms of how their dK-based anonymized versions resist (or fail) to
various types of attacks. Our experimental results lead to three contributions.
First, we identify the strength of an attacker based on the graph
characteristics of the subset of nodes from which it starts the
de-anonymization attack. Second, we quantify the relative effectiveness of
dK-series for graph anonymization. And third, we identify the properties of the
original graph that make it more vulnerable to de-anonymization.",1907.01695v1,cs.SI,2019-07-03 01:20:15+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Sameera Horawalavithana'), arxiv.Result.Author('Adriana Iamnitchi')]",

privacy-preserving communications. The existing anonymous authentication and
routing are applied at higher layers of networks, ignoring physical layer (PHY)

concept of PHY anonymity, and reveal that the receiver can unmask the sender's
identity by only analyzing the PHY information, i.e., the signaling patterns
and the characteristics of channel. We investigate two practical scenarios,
where the receiver has more antennas than the sender in the strong receiver
case, and vice versa in the strong sender case. For each scenario, we first
investigate sender detection strategy at the receiver, and then we develop
corresponding anonymous precoding to address anonymity while guaranteeing high
receive signal-to-interference-plus-noise-ratio (SINR) for communications. In
particular, an interference suppression anonymous precoder is first proposed,
assisted by a dedicated transmit phase equalizer for removing phase ambiguity.
Afterwards, a constructive interference anonymous precoder is further
investigated to utilize the inter-antenna interference as a beneficial element
without loss of sender's anonymity. Simulation demonstrates the proposed
anonymous precoders are able to preserve the sender's anonymity and
simultaneously guarantee high receive SINR, opening a new dimension on PHY

240,Adaptive Risk-Limiting Ballot Comparison Audits,"Risk-limiting audits (RLAs) are rigorous statistical procedures meant to
detect invalid election results. RLAs examine paper ballots cast during the
election to statistically assess the possibility of a disagreement between the
winner determined by the ballots and the winner reported by tabulation. The
most ballot efficient approaches proceed by ""ballot comparison."" However,
ballot comparison requires an untrusted declaration of the contents of each
cast ballot, rather than a simple tabulation of vote totals. This ""cast-vote
record table"" (CVR) is then spot-checked against ballots for consistency. In
many practical settings, the cost of generating a suitable CVR dominates the
cost of conducting the audit, preventing widespread adoption of these
sample-efficient techniques.
  We introduce a new RLA procedure: an ""adaptive ballot comparison"" audit. In
this audit, a global CVR is never produced; instead, a three-stage procedure is
iterated:
  1) a batch is selected,
  2) a CVR is produced for that batch, and
  3) a ballot within the batch is sampled, inspected by auditors, and compared
with the CVR.
  We prove that such an audit can achieve risk commensurate with standard
comparison audits while generating a fraction of the CVR. We present three main
contributions:
  1) a formal adversarial model for RLAs;
  2) definition and analysis of an adaptive audit procedure with rigorous risk
limits and an associated correctness analysis accounting for the incidental
errors arising in typical audits; and
  3) an analysis of practical efficiency.
  This method can be organized in rounds (as is typical for comparison audits)
where sampled CVRs are produced in parallel. Using data from Florida's 2020
presidential election with 5% risk and 1% margin, only 22% of the CVR is
generated; at 10% margin, only 2% is generated.",2202.02607v5,cs.CR,2022-02-05 18:04:27+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Benjamin Fuller'), arxiv.Result.Author('Abigail Harrison'), arxiv.Result.Author('Alexander Russell')]",

''yes''. If the basis is not reduced, or if the precision used is not

algorithm will answer ''failed''. Hence a positive answer is a rigorous
certificate. For implementing the certificate itself, we propose a floating
point algorithm for computing (certified) error bounds for the entries of the R
factor of the QR matrix factorization. This algorithm takes into account all
possible approximation and rounding errors. The cost 12n^3+O(n^2) of the
certificate is only six times more than the cost of numerical algorithms for
computing the QR factorization itself, and the certificate may be implemented
using matrix library routines only. We report experiments that show that for a
reduced basis of adequate dimension and quality the certificate succeeds, and
establish the effectiveness of the certificate. This effectiveness is applied

certificates. These certificates bound the sub-optimality and return of the

quality is not satisfactory. We further introduce two new algorithms with
certificates and present a new framework for theoretical analysis that
guarantees the quality of their policies and certificates. For tabular MDPs, we
show that computing certificates can even improve the sample-efficiency of

the future information society. It will have an enormous impact on the election
process making it fast, reliable and inexpensive. Nonetheless, so far remote

susceptibility of the voter's PC to various cyber-attacks. As a result, most
the research effort is put into developing protocols and machines for poll-site
electronic voting. Although these solutions yield promising results, they
cannot be directly adopted to Internet voting because of secure platform
problem. However, the cryptographic components they utilize may be very useful.
This paper presents a scheme based on combination of mixnets and homomorphic
encryption borrowed from robust poll-site voting, along with techniques
recommended for remote voting -- code sheets and test ballots. The protocol
tries to minimize the trust put in voter's PC by making the voter responsible
for manual encryption of his vote. To achieve this, the voter obtains a paper
ballot that allows him to scramble the vote by performing simple operations
(lookup in a table). Creation of paper ballots, as well as decryption of votes,
is performed by a group of cooperating trusted servers. As a result, the scheme
is characterized by strong asymmetry -- all computations are carried out on the
server side. In consequence it does not require any additional hardware on the
voter's side, and offers distributed trust, receipt-freeness and verifiability.",0804.2349v1,cs.CR,2008-04-15 10:26:40+00:00,[arxiv.Result.Author('Lukasz Nitschke')],

immutable revocation history. We propose and evaluate a new revocation
transparency protocol that introduces postcertificates and utilizes the
existing Certificate Transparency (CT) logs. The protocol is practical, has a
low deployment cost, provides an immutable history of revocations, enables
delegation, and helps to detect revocation-related misbehavior by certificate
authorities (CAs). With this protocol, a holder of a postcertificate can bypass
the issuing CA and autonomously initiate the revocation process via submission
of the postcertificate to a CT log. The CAs are required to monitor CT logs and
proceed with the revocation upon detection of a postcertificate. Revocation
status delivery is performed independently and with an arbitrary status
protocol. Postcertificates can increase the accountability of the CAs and
empower the certificate owners by giving them additional control over the
status of the certificates. We evaluate the protocol, measure log and monitor
performance, and conclude that it is possible to provide revocation

requires knowing how the ballots cast in an election are organized into groups,

with number of ballots in each group is called a ballot manifest. What if the
ballot manifest is not accurate? Surprisingly, even if ballots are known to be
missing from the manifest, it is not necessary to make worst-case assumptions
about those ballots--for instance, to adjust the margin by the number of
missing ballots--to ensure that the audit remains conservative. Rather, it
suffices to make worst-case assumptions about the individual randomly selected
ballots that the audit cannot find. This observation provides a simple
modification to some risk-limiting audit procedures that makes them
automatically become more conservative if the ballot manifest has errors. The
modification--phantoms to evil zombies (~2EZ)--requires only an upper bound on
the total number of ballots cast. ~2EZ makes the audit P-value stochastically
larger than it would be had the manifest been accurate, automatically requiring
more than enough ballots to be audited to offset the manifest errors. This
ensures that the true risk limit remains smaller than the nominal risk limit.

contrast, decoy voters are trapped into selling their ballots at a low, or even

270,Changes in granulation scales over the solar cycle seen with SDO/HMI and Hinode/SOT,"The Sun is the only star where the superficial turbulent convection can be
observed at very high spatial resolution. The Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO)
has continuously observed the full Sun from space with multi-wavelength filters
since July 2010. In particular, the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI)
instrument takes high-cadence frames (45 seconds) of continuum intensity in
which solar granulation is visible. We aimed to follow the evolution of the
solar granules over an activity cycle and look for changes in their spatial
properties. We investigated the density of granules and their mean area derived
directly from the segmentation of deconvolved images from SDO/HMI. To perform
the segmentation, we define granules as convex elements of images. We measured
an approximately 2% variation in the density and the mean area of granules over
the cycle, the density of granules being greater at solar maximum with a
smaller granule mean area. The maximum density appears to be delayed by about
one year compared to classical activity indicators, such as the sunspot number.
We complemented this study with high-spatial-resolution observations obtained
with Hinode/SOTBFI (Solar Optical Telescope Broadband Filter Imager), which are
consistent with our results. The observed variations in solar granulation at
the disc centre reveal a direct insight into the change in the physical

271,The ATHENA Class of Risk-Limiting Ballot Polling Audits,"The main risk-limiting ballot polling audit in use today, BRAVO, is designed
for use when single ballots are drawn at random and a decision regarding
whether to stop the audit or draw another ballot is taken after each ballot
draw (ballot-by-ballot (B2) audits). On the other hand, real ballot polling
audits draw many ballots in a single round before determining whether to stop
(round-by-round (R2) audits). We show that BRAVO results in significant
inefficiency when directly applied to real R2 audits. We present the ATHENA
class of R2 stopping rules, which we show are risk-limiting if the round
schedule is pre-determined (before the audit begins). We prove that each rule
is at least as efficient as the corresponding BRAVO stopping rule applied at
the end of the round. We have open-source software libraries implementing most
of our results.
  We show that ATHENA halves the number of ballots required, for all state
margins in the 2016 US Presidential election and a first round with $90\%$
stopping probability, when compared to BRAVO (stopping rule applied at the end
of the round). We present simulation results supporting the 90% stopping
probability claims and our claims for the risk accrued in the first round.
Further, ATHENA reduces the number of ballots by more than a quarter for low
margins, when compared to the BRAVO stopping rule applied on ballots in
selection order. This implies that keeping track of the order when drawing
ballots R2 is not beneficial, because ATHENA is more efficient even without
information on selection order. These results are significant because current
approaches to real ballot polling election audits use the B2 BRAVO rules,
requiring about twice as much work on the part of election officials. Applying
the rules in selection order requires fewer ballots, but keeping track of the
order, and entering it into audit software, adds to the effort.",2008.02315v5,cs.CR,2020-08-05 18:47:37+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Filip Zagórski'), arxiv.Result.Author('Grant McClearn'), arxiv.Result.Author('Sarah Morin'), arxiv.Result.Author('Neal McBurnett'), arxiv.Result.Author('Poorvi L.

SOBA combines three ideas: (1) publishing cast vote records (CVRs) separately
for each contest, so that anyone can verify that each reported contest outcome
is correct, if the CVRs reflect voters' intentions with sufficient accuracy;
(2) shrouding a mapping between ballots and the CVRs for those ballots to
prevent the loss of privacy that could occur otherwise; (3) assessing the
accuracy with which the CVRs reflect voters' intentions for a collection of
contests while simultaneously assessing the integrity of the shrouded mapping
between ballots and CVRs by comparing randomly selected ballots to the CVRs
that purport to represent them. Step (1) is related to work by the Humboldt

individual contests rather than images of entire ballots preserves privacy.
Step (2) requires a cryptographic commitment from elections officials.

Results indicated that of those voters who chose to examine the printed ballot,

data. Kepler is also starting to deliver similar data. Now, several F and G
main-sequence stars have been analyzed. The techniques developed to interpret
light curves directly inherit from the experience got on the Sun with
helioseismology. I describe in this review the methods currently used to
analyze these light curves. First, these data provide an accurate determination
of the stellar rotation rate. This is possible thanks to the magnetic activity
of stars. The power spectra of light curves put also constraints on the stellar
granulation, which can be directly compared to 3-D stellar atmosphere models;
this shows still unexplained discrepancies. I then detailed a standard method
for extracting p-mode characteristics (frequency, amplitude and lifetime).
CoRoT has revealed unexpected short life times for F stars. Last, I also

shown that many of the NP-hardness shields, previously obtained, vanish when
the electorate has single-peaked or nearly single-peaked preferences. In light
of these results, we investigate whether it is possible to reimpose NP-hardness
shields for such electorates by allowing the voters to specify partial
preferences instead of insisting they cast complete ballots. In particular, we
show that in single-peaked and nearly single-peaked electorates, if voters are
allowed to submit top-truncated ballots, then the complexity of manipulation

NP-complete.",1511.08141v1,cs.GT,2015-11-25 18:24:16+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Vijay Menon'), arxiv.Result.Author('Kate Larson')]",

290,Changes in granulation scales over the solar cycle seen with SDO/HMI and Hinode/SOT,"The Sun is the only star where the superficial turbulent convection can be
observed at very high spatial resolution. The Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO)
has continuously observed the full Sun from space with multi-wavelength filters
since July 2010. In particular, the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI)
instrument takes high-cadence frames (45 seconds) of continuum intensity in
which solar granulation is visible. We aimed to follow the evolution of the
solar granules over an activity cycle and look for changes in their spatial
properties. We investigated the density of granules and their mean area derived
directly from the segmentation of deconvolved images from SDO/HMI. To perform
the segmentation, we define granules as convex elements of images. We measured
an approximately 2% variation in the density and the mean area of granules over
the cycle, the density of granules being greater at solar maximum with a
smaller granule mean area. The maximum density appears to be delayed by about
one year compared to classical activity indicators, such as the sunspot number.
We complemented this study with high-spatial-resolution observations obtained
with Hinode/SOTBFI (Solar Optical Telescope Broadband Filter Imager), which are
consistent with our results. The observed variations in solar granulation at
the disc centre reveal a direct insight into the change in the physical
properties that occur in the upper convective zone during a solar cycle. These

for use when single ballots are drawn at random and a decision regarding
whether to stop the audit or draw another ballot is taken after each ballot
draw (ballot-by-ballot (B2) audits). On the other hand, real ballot polling
audits draw many ballots in a single round before determining whether to stop
(round-by-round (R2) audits). We show that BRAVO results in significant
inefficiency when directly applied to real R2 audits. We present the ATHENA
class of R2 stopping rules, which we show are risk-limiting if the round
schedule is pre-determined (before the audit begins). We prove that each rule
is at least as efficient as the corresponding BRAVO stopping rule applied at
the end of the round. We have open-source software libraries implementing most

  We show that ATHENA halves the number of ballots required, for all state
margins in the 2016 US Presidential election and a first round with $90\%$
stopping probability, when compared to BRAVO (stopping rule applied at the end
of the round). We present simulation results supporting the 90% stopping
probability claims and our claims for the risk accrued in the first round.
Further, ATHENA reduces the number of ballots by more than a quarter for low
margins, when compared to the BRAVO stopping rule applied on ballots in
selection order. This implies that keeping track of the order when drawing
ballots R2 is not beneficial, because ATHENA is more efficient even without
information on selection order. These results are significant because current
approaches to real ballot polling election audits use the B2 BRAVO rules,
requiring about twice as much work on the part of election officials. Applying
the rules in selection order requires fewer ballots, but keeping track of the
order, and entering it into audit software, adds to the effort.",2008.02315v5,cs.CR,2020-08-05 18:47:37+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Filip Zagórski'), arxiv.Result.Author('Grant McClearn'), arxiv.Result.Author('Sarah Morin'), arxiv.Result.Author('Neal McBurnett'), arxiv.Result.Author('Poorvi L.

not require identification numbers on the ballots or counting many ballots per

justifiably high confidence that the reported results of an election are

SOBA combines three ideas: (1) publishing cast vote records (CVRs) separately
for each contest, so that anyone can verify that each reported contest outcome
is correct, if the CVRs reflect voters' intentions with sufficient accuracy;
(2) shrouding a mapping between ballots and the CVRs for those ballots to
prevent the loss of privacy that could occur otherwise; (3) assessing the
accuracy with which the CVRs reflect voters' intentions for a collection of
contests while simultaneously assessing the integrity of the shrouded mapping
between ballots and CVRs by comparing randomly selected ballots to the CVRs
that purport to represent them. Step (1) is related to work by the Humboldt
County Election Transparency Project, but publishing CVRs separately for
individual contests rather than images of entire ballots preserves privacy.
Step (2) requires a cryptographic commitment from elections officials.
Observers participate in step (3), which relies on the ""super-simple
simultaneous single-ballot risk-limiting audit."" Step (3) is designed to reveal
relatively few ballots if the shrouded mapping is proper and the CVRs
accurately reflect voter intent. But if the reported outcomes of the contests

Recent studies (e.g., Bernhard, et al. 2020) suggest the verification rate is

of voters being unable to do so accurately or whether this is because voters
simply choose not to attempt verification in the first place. In order to
understand this problem, we conducted an experiment in which 108 participants
participated in a mock election where the BMD displayed the voters' true
choices, but then changed a subset of those choices on the printed ballot. The
design of the printed ballot, the length of the ballot, the number of changes
that were made to the ballot, the location of those changes, and the
instructions provided to the voters were manipulated as part of the experiment.
Results indicated that of those voters who chose to examine the printed ballot,
76% detected anomalies, indicating that voters can reliably detect errors on

300,Limiting Risk by Turning Manifest Phantoms into Evil Zombies,"Drawing a random sample of ballots to conduct a risk-limiting audit generally
requires knowing how the ballots cast in an election are organized into groups,
for instance, how many containers of ballots there are in all and how many
ballots are in each container. A list of the ballot group identifiers along
with number of ballots in each group is called a ballot manifest. What if the
ballot manifest is not accurate? Surprisingly, even if ballots are known to be
missing from the manifest, it is not necessary to make worst-case assumptions
about those ballots--for instance, to adjust the margin by the number of
missing ballots--to ensure that the audit remains conservative. Rather, it
suffices to make worst-case assumptions about the individual randomly selected
ballots that the audit cannot find. This observation provides a simple
modification to some risk-limiting audit procedures that makes them
automatically become more conservative if the ballot manifest has errors. The
modification--phantoms to evil zombies (~2EZ)--requires only an upper bound on
the total number of ballots cast. ~2EZ makes the audit P-value stochastically
larger than it would be had the manifest been accurate, automatically requiring
more than enough ballots to be audited to offset the manifest errors. This
ensures that the true risk limit remains smaller than the nominal risk limit.
On the other hand, if the manifest is in fact accurate and the upper bound on
the total number of ballots equals the total according to the manifest, ~2EZ
has no effect at all on the number of ballots audited nor on the true risk
limit.",1207.3413v1,stat.AP,2012-07-14 11:26:02+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Jorge H. Banuelos'), arxiv.Result.Author('Philip B. Stark')]",

Recent studies (e.g., Bernhard, et al. 2020) suggest the verification rate is
low. What is not clear from previous research is whether this is more a result
of voters being unable to do so accurately or whether this is because voters
simply choose not to attempt verification in the first place. In order to
understand this problem, we conducted an experiment in which 108 participants
participated in a mock election where the BMD displayed the voters' true
choices, but then changed a subset of those choices on the printed ballot. The
design of the printed ballot, the length of the ballot, the number of changes
that were made to the ballot, the location of those changes, and the
instructions provided to the voters were manipulated as part of the experiment.
Results indicated that of those voters who chose to examine the printed ballot,
76% detected anomalies, indicating that voters can reliably detect errors on
their ballot if they will simply review it. This suggests that administrative

traditional plurality voting in which voters submit rankings over the
candidates rather than single votes. In practice, elections using IRV often
restrict the ballot length, the number of candidates a voter is allowed to rank
on their ballot. We theoretically and empirically analyze how ballot length can
influence the outcome of an election, given fixed voter preferences. We show
that there exist preference profiles over $k$ candidates such that up to $k-1$
different candidates win at different ballot lengths. We derive exact lower
bounds on the number of voters required for such profiles and provide a
construction matching the lower bound for unrestricted voter preferences.
Additionally, we characterize which sequences of winners are possible over
ballot lengths and provide explicit profile constructions achieving any
feasible winner sequence. We also examine how classic preference restrictions
influence our results--for instance, single-peakedness makes $k-1$ different
winners impossible but still allows at least $\Omega(\sqrt k)$. Finally, we
analyze a collection of 168 real-world elections, where we truncate rankings to
simulate shorter ballots. We find that shorter ballots could have changed the
outcome in one quarter of these elections. Our results highlight ballot length
as a consequential degree of freedom in the design of IRV elections.",2207.08958v3,cs.MA,2022-07-18 22:01:13+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Kiran Tomlinson'), arxiv.Result.Author('Johan Ugander'), arxiv.Result.Author('Jon Kleinberg')]",

320,Limiting Risk by Turning Manifest Phantoms into Evil Zombies,"Drawing a random sample of ballots to conduct a risk-limiting audit generally
requires knowing how the ballots cast in an election are organized into groups,
for instance, how many containers of ballots there are in all and how many
ballots are in each container. A list of the ballot group identifiers along
with number of ballots in each group is called a ballot manifest. What if the
ballot manifest is not accurate? Surprisingly, even if ballots are known to be
missing from the manifest, it is not necessary to make worst-case assumptions
about those ballots--for instance, to adjust the margin by the number of
missing ballots--to ensure that the audit remains conservative. Rather, it
suffices to make worst-case assumptions about the individual randomly selected
ballots that the audit cannot find. This observation provides a simple
modification to some risk-limiting audit procedures that makes them
automatically become more conservative if the ballot manifest has errors. The
modification--phantoms to evil zombies (~2EZ)--requires only an upper bound on
the total number of ballots cast. ~2EZ makes the audit P-value stochastically
larger than it would be had the manifest been accurate, automatically requiring
more than enough ballots to be audited to offset the manifest errors. This
ensures that the true risk limit remains smaller than the nominal risk limit.
On the other hand, if the manifest is in fact accurate and the upper bound on
the total number of ballots equals the total according to the manifest, ~2EZ
has no effect at all on the number of ballots audited nor on the true risk
limit.",1207.3413v1,stat.AP,2012-07-14 11:26:02+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Jorge H. Banuelos'), arxiv.Result.Author('Philip B. Stark')]",

permutations avoiding $132$ and $312$ with left factors of Dyck paths. In

In this study, we altered votes on a voter's ballot after they had made their
selections on a BMD. We then required them to examine their ballots for any
changes from the slate they used to vote. Overall accuracy was exceptionally
high. Participants saw 1440 total contests, and of those 1440, there were a
total of 4 errors, so total accuracy was 99.8%. Participants were able to
perform with near-perfect accuracy regardless of ballot length, ballot type,
number of altered races, and location of altered races. Detection performance
was extremely robust. We conclude that with proper direction and resources,
voters can be near-perfect detectors of ballot changes on printed paper ballots
after voting with a BMD. This finding has significant implications for the
voting community as BMD use continues to grow. Research should now focus on
identifying administrative and behavioral methods that will prompt and

Menu"" consisting of several prices. In equilibrium, the adversary can buy the
real ballots of any strict subset of districts at a price corresponding to the
willingness to sell on the part of the citizens holding such ballots. By
contrast, decoy voters are trapped into selling their ballots at a low, or even
negligible, price. Blowing up the adversary's budget by introducing decoy
ballots may thus turn out to be futile. The Devil's Menu can also be applied to

audits draw many ballots in a single round before determining whether to stop
(round-by-round (R2) audits). We show that BRAVO results in significant
inefficiency when directly applied to real R2 audits. We present the ATHENA
class of R2 stopping rules, which we show are risk-limiting if the round
schedule is pre-determined (before the audit begins). We prove that each rule

the end of the round. We have open-source software libraries implementing most

ballot marking devices (BMDs) is presently the subject of some controversy.
Recent studies (e.g., Bernhard, et al. 2020) suggest the verification rate is
low. What is not clear from previous research is whether this is more a result
of voters being unable to do so accurately or whether this is because voters
simply choose not to attempt verification in the first place. In order to
understand this problem, we conducted an experiment in which 108 participants
participated in a mock election where the BMD displayed the voters' true
choices, but then changed a subset of those choices on the printed ballot. The
design of the printed ballot, the length of the ballot, the number of changes
that were made to the ballot, the location of those changes, and the
instructions provided to the voters were manipulated as part of the experiment.
Results indicated that of those voters who chose to examine the printed ballot,
76% detected anomalies, indicating that voters can reliably detect errors on
their ballot if they will simply review it. This suggests that administrative
remedies, rather than attempts to alter fundamental human perceptual
capabilities, could be employed to encourage voters to check their ballots,
which could prove as an effective countermeasure.",2003.04997v1,cs.HC,2020-03-10 21:06:42+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Philip Kortum'), arxiv.Result.Author('Michael D. Byrne'), arxiv.Result.Author('Julie Whitmore')]",

  Colorado's current audit software (RLATool) needs to be improved to audit
these contests that cross county lines and to audit small contests efficiently.
  This paper addresses these needs. It presents extremely simple but
inefficient methods, more efficient methods that combine ballot polling and
ballot-level comparisons using stratified samples, and methods that combine
ballot-level comparison and variable-size batch comparison audits in a way that
does not require stratified sampling.

incorrect election results, independent of why the result was incorrect.
Ballot-polling audits select ballots at random and interpret those ballots as
evidence for and against the reported result, continuing this process until
either they support the recorded result, or they fall back to a full manual
recount. For elections with digitised scanning and counting of ballots, a
comparison audit compares randomly selected digital ballots with their paper
versions. Discrepancies are referred to as errors, and are used to build
evidence against or in support of the recorded result. Risk-limiting audits for
first-past-the-post elections are well understood, and used in some US
elections. We define a number of approaches to ballot-polling and comparison
risk-limiting audits for Instant Runoff Voting (IRV) elections. We show that
for almost all real elections we found, we can perform a risk-limiting audit by
looking at only a small fraction of the total ballots (assuming no errors were
made in the tallying and distribution of votes).",1903.08804v2,cs.DS,2019-03-20 06:19:10+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Michelle Blom'), arxiv.Result.Author('Peter J. Stuckey'), arxiv.Result.Author('Vanessa Teague')]",

334,Ballot Length in Instant Runoff Voting,"Instant runoff voting (IRV) is an increasingly-popular alternative to
traditional plurality voting in which voters submit rankings over the
candidates rather than single votes. In practice, elections using IRV often
restrict the ballot length, the number of candidates a voter is allowed to rank
on their ballot. We theoretically and empirically analyze how ballot length can
influence the outcome of an election, given fixed voter preferences. We show
that there exist preference profiles over $k$ candidates such that up to $k-1$
different candidates win at different ballot lengths. We derive exact lower
bounds on the number of voters required for such profiles and provide a
construction matching the lower bound for unrestricted voter preferences.
Additionally, we characterize which sequences of winners are possible over
ballot lengths and provide explicit profile constructions achieving any
feasible winner sequence. We also examine how classic preference restrictions
influence our results--for instance, single-peakedness makes $k-1$ different
winners impossible but still allows at least $\Omega(\sqrt k)$. Finally, we
analyze a collection of 168 real-world elections, where we truncate rankings to
simulate shorter ballots. We find that shorter ballots could have changed the
outcome in one quarter of these elections. Our results highlight ballot length
as a consequential degree of freedom in the design of IRV elections.",2207.08958v3,cs.MA,2022-07-18 22:01:13+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Kiran Tomlinson'), arxiv.Result.Author('Johan Ugander'), arxiv.Result.Author('Jon Kleinberg')]",

342,Limiting Risk by Turning Manifest Phantoms into Evil Zombies,"Drawing a random sample of ballots to conduct a risk-limiting audit generally
requires knowing how the ballots cast in an election are organized into groups,
for instance, how many containers of ballots there are in all and how many
ballots are in each container. A list of the ballot group identifiers along
with number of ballots in each group is called a ballot manifest. What if the
ballot manifest is not accurate? Surprisingly, even if ballots are known to be
missing from the manifest, it is not necessary to make worst-case assumptions
about those ballots--for instance, to adjust the margin by the number of
missing ballots--to ensure that the audit remains conservative. Rather, it
suffices to make worst-case assumptions about the individual randomly selected
ballots that the audit cannot find. This observation provides a simple
modification to some risk-limiting audit procedures that makes them
automatically become more conservative if the ballot manifest has errors. The
modification--phantoms to evil zombies (~2EZ)--requires only an upper bound on
the total number of ballots cast. ~2EZ makes the audit P-value stochastically
larger than it would be had the manifest been accurate, automatically requiring
more than enough ballots to be audited to offset the manifest errors. This
ensures that the true risk limit remains smaller than the nominal risk limit.
On the other hand, if the manifest is in fact accurate and the upper bound on
the total number of ballots equals the total according to the manifest, ~2EZ
has no effect at all on the number of ballots audited nor on the true risk
limit.",1207.3413v1,stat.AP,2012-07-14 11:26:02+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Jorge H. Banuelos'), arxiv.Result.Author('Philip B. Stark')]",

344,Modeling Voters in Multi-Winner Approval Voting,"In many real world situations, collective decisions are made using voting
and, in scenarios such as committee or board elections, employing voting rules
that return multiple winners. In multi-winner approval voting (AV), an agent
submits a ballot consisting of approvals for as many candidates as they wish,
and winners are chosen by tallying up the votes and choosing the top-$k$
candidates receiving the most approvals. In many scenarios, an agent may
manipulate the ballot they submit in order to achieve a better outcome by
voting in a way that does not reflect their true preferences. In complex and
uncertain situations, agents may use heuristics instead of incurring the
additional effort required to compute the manipulation which most favors them.
In this paper, we examine voting behavior in single-winner and multi-winner
approval voting scenarios with varying degrees of uncertainty using behavioral
data obtained from Mechanical Turk. We find that people generally manipulate
their vote to obtain a better outcome, but often do not identify the optimal
manipulation. There are a number of predictive models of agent behavior in the
COMSOC and psychology literature that are based on cognitively plausible
heuristic strategies. We show that the existing approaches do not adequately
model real-world data. We propose a novel model that takes into account the
size of the winning set and human cognitive constraints, and demonstrate that
this model is more effective at capturing real-world behaviors in multi-winner

perform with near-perfect accuracy regardless of ballot length, ballot type,
number of altered races, and location of altered races. Detection performance
was extremely robust. We conclude that with proper direction and resources,
voters can be near-perfect detectors of ballot changes on printed paper ballots

willingness to sell on the part of the citizens holding such ballots. By
contrast, decoy voters are trapped into selling their ballots at a low, or even

351,The ATHENA Class of Risk-Limiting Ballot Polling Audits,"The main risk-limiting ballot polling audit in use today, BRAVO, is designed
for use when single ballots are drawn at random and a decision regarding
whether to stop the audit or draw another ballot is taken after each ballot
draw (ballot-by-ballot (B2) audits). On the other hand, real ballot polling
audits draw many ballots in a single round before determining whether to stop
(round-by-round (R2) audits). We show that BRAVO results in significant
inefficiency when directly applied to real R2 audits. We present the ATHENA
class of R2 stopping rules, which we show are risk-limiting if the round
schedule is pre-determined (before the audit begins). We prove that each rule
is at least as efficient as the corresponding BRAVO stopping rule applied at
the end of the round. We have open-source software libraries implementing most
of our results.
  We show that ATHENA halves the number of ballots required, for all state
margins in the 2016 US Presidential election and a first round with $90\%$
stopping probability, when compared to BRAVO (stopping rule applied at the end
of the round). We present simulation results supporting the 90% stopping
probability claims and our claims for the risk accrued in the first round.
Further, ATHENA reduces the number of ballots by more than a quarter for low
margins, when compared to the BRAVO stopping rule applied on ballots in
selection order. This implies that keeping track of the order when drawing
ballots R2 is not beneficial, because ATHENA is more efficient even without
information on selection order. These results are significant because current
approaches to real ballot polling election audits use the B2 BRAVO rules,
requiring about twice as much work on the part of election officials. Applying
the rules in selection order requires fewer ballots, but keeping track of the

not require identification numbers on the ballots or counting many ballots per

355,SOBA: Secrecy-preserving Observable Ballot-level Audit,"SOBA is an approach to election verification that provides observers with
justifiably high confidence that the reported results of an election are
consistent with an audit trail (""ballots""), which can be paper or electronic.
SOBA combines three ideas: (1) publishing cast vote records (CVRs) separately
for each contest, so that anyone can verify that each reported contest outcome
is correct, if the CVRs reflect voters' intentions with sufficient accuracy;
(2) shrouding a mapping between ballots and the CVRs for those ballots to
prevent the loss of privacy that could occur otherwise; (3) assessing the
accuracy with which the CVRs reflect voters' intentions for a collection of
contests while simultaneously assessing the integrity of the shrouded mapping
between ballots and CVRs by comparing randomly selected ballots to the CVRs
that purport to represent them. Step (1) is related to work by the Humboldt
County Election Transparency Project, but publishing CVRs separately for
individual contests rather than images of entire ballots preserves privacy.
Step (2) requires a cryptographic commitment from elections officials.
Observers participate in step (3), which relies on the ""super-simple
simultaneous single-ballot risk-limiting audit."" Step (3) is designed to reveal
relatively few ballots if the shrouded mapping is proper and the CVRs
accurately reflect voter intent. But if the reported outcomes of the contests
differ from the outcomes that a full hand count would show, step (3) is
guaranteed to have a large chance of requiring all the ballots to be counted by
hand, thereby limiting the risk that an incorrect outcome will become official
and final.",1105.5803v2,stat.AP,2011-05-29 17:00:20+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Josh Benaloh'), arxiv.Result.Author('Douglas Jones'), arxiv.Result.Author('Eric Lazarus'), arxiv.Result.Author('Mark Lindeman'), arxiv.Result.Author('Philip B. Stark')]",
356,"Voter Verification of BMD Ballots Is a Two-Part Question: Can They? Mostly, They Can. Do They? Mostly, They Don't","The question of whether or not voters actually verify ballots produced by
ballot marking devices (BMDs) is presently the subject of some controversy.
Recent studies (e.g., Bernhard, et al. 2020) suggest the verification rate is
low. What is not clear from previous research is whether this is more a result
of voters being unable to do so accurately or whether this is because voters
simply choose not to attempt verification in the first place. In order to
understand this problem, we conducted an experiment in which 108 participants
participated in a mock election where the BMD displayed the voters' true
choices, but then changed a subset of those choices on the printed ballot. The
design of the printed ballot, the length of the ballot, the number of changes
that were made to the ballot, the location of those changes, and the
instructions provided to the voters were manipulated as part of the experiment.
Results indicated that of those voters who chose to examine the printed ballot,
76% detected anomalies, indicating that voters can reliably detect errors on
their ballot if they will simply review it. This suggests that administrative
remedies, rather than attempts to alter fundamental human perceptual
capabilities, could be employed to encourage voters to check their ballots,

the Sun using 10 years of GOLF data. The present analysis is based on the
exploitation of the collective properties of the predicted low-frequency (25 to
140 microHz) g modes: their asymptotic nature, which implies a quasi
equidistant separation of their periods for a given angular degree (l). The
Power Spectrum (PS) of the Power Spectrum Density (PSD), reveals a significant
structure indicating the presence of features (peaks) in the PSD with near
equidistant periods corresponding to l=1 modes in the range n=-4 to n=-26. The
study of its statistical significance of this feature was fully undertaken and
complemented with Monte Carlo simulations. This structure has a confidence
level better than 99.86% not to be due to pure noise. Furthermore, a detailed
study of this structure suggests that the gravity modes have a much more
complex structure than the one initially expected (line-widths, magnetic
splittings...). Compared to the latest solar models, the obtained results tend
to favor a solar core rotating significantly faster than the rest of the

incorrect election results, independent of why the result was incorrect.
Ballot-polling audits select ballots at random and interpret those ballots as
evidence for and against the reported result, continuing this process until
either they support the recorded result, or they fall back to a full manual
recount. For elections with digitised scanning and counting of ballots, a
comparison audit compares randomly selected digital ballots with their paper
versions. Discrepancies are referred to as errors, and are used to build
evidence against or in support of the recorded result. Risk-limiting audits for
first-past-the-post elections are well understood, and used in some US
elections. We define a number of approaches to ballot-polling and comparison
risk-limiting audits for Instant Runoff Voting (IRV) elections. We show that
for almost all real elections we found, we can perform a risk-limiting audit by
looking at only a small fraction of the total ballots (assuming no errors were

printed ballot after making their selections on a Ballot Marking Device (BMD).
In this study, we altered votes on a voter's ballot after they had made their
selections on a BMD. We then required them to examine their ballots for any
changes from the slate they used to vote. Overall accuracy was exceptionally
high. Participants saw 1440 total contests, and of those 1440, there were a
total of 4 errors, so total accuracy was 99.8%. Participants were able to
perform with near-perfect accuracy regardless of ballot length, ballot type,
number of altered races, and location of altered races. Detection performance
was extremely robust. We conclude that with proper direction and resources,
voters can be near-perfect detectors of ballot changes on printed paper ballots
after voting with a BMD. This finding has significant implications for the
voting community as BMD use continues to grow. Research should now focus on
identifying administrative and behavioral methods that will prompt and

362,Locating ballot drop boxes,"For decades, voting-by-mail and the use of ballot drop boxes has
substantially grown, and in response, many election officials have added new
drop boxes to their voting infrastructure. However, existing guidance for
locating drop boxes is limited. In this paper, we introduce an integer
programming model, the drop box location problem (DBLP), to locate drop boxes.
The DBLP considers criteria of cost, voter access, and risk. The cost of the
drop box system is determined by the fixed cost of adding drop boxes and the
operational cost of a collection tour by a bipartisan team who regularly
collects ballots from selected locations. The DBLP utilizes covering sets to
ensure each voter is in close proximity to a drop box and incorporates a novel
measure of access to measure the ability to use multiple voting pathways to
vote. The DBLP is shown to be NP-Hard, and we introduce a heuristic to generate
a large number of feasible solutions for policy makers to select from a
posteriori. Using a real-world case study of Milwaukee, WI, we study the
benefit of the DBLP. The results demonstrate that the proposed optimization
model identifies drop box locations that perform well across multiple criteria.
The results also demonstrate that the trade-off between cost, access, and risk
is non-trivial, which supports the use of the proposed optimization-based
approach to select drop box locations.",2207.10707v2,math.OC,2022-07-21 18:41:38+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Adam P. Schmidt'), arxiv.Result.Author('Laura A. Albert')]",

367,Limiting Risk by Turning Manifest Phantoms into Evil Zombies,"Drawing a random sample of ballots to conduct a risk-limiting audit generally
requires knowing how the ballots cast in an election are organized into groups,
for instance, how many containers of ballots there are in all and how many
ballots are in each container. A list of the ballot group identifiers along
with number of ballots in each group is called a ballot manifest. What if the
ballot manifest is not accurate? Surprisingly, even if ballots are known to be
missing from the manifest, it is not necessary to make worst-case assumptions
about those ballots--for instance, to adjust the margin by the number of
missing ballots--to ensure that the audit remains conservative. Rather, it
suffices to make worst-case assumptions about the individual randomly selected
ballots that the audit cannot find. This observation provides a simple
modification to some risk-limiting audit procedures that makes them
automatically become more conservative if the ballot manifest has errors. The
modification--phantoms to evil zombies (~2EZ)--requires only an upper bound on
the total number of ballots cast. ~2EZ makes the audit P-value stochastically
larger than it would be had the manifest been accurate, automatically requiring
more than enough ballots to be audited to offset the manifest errors. This
ensures that the true risk limit remains smaller than the nominal risk limit.
On the other hand, if the manifest is in fact accurate and the upper bound on
the total number of ballots equals the total according to the manifest, ~2EZ
has no effect at all on the number of ballots audited nor on the true risk
limit.",1207.3413v1,stat.AP,2012-07-14 11:26:02+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Jorge H. Banuelos'), arxiv.Result.Author('Philip B. Stark')]",

ballot box closest to them. In this variant of gerrymandering, for a given set
of possible locations of ballot boxes and known political preferences of $n$
voters, the task is to identify locations for $k$ boxes out of $m$ possible
locations to guarantee victory of a certain party in at least $l$ districts.
Here integers $k$ and $l$ are some selected parameter.
  It is known that the problem is NP-complete already for 4 political parties

developed. We initiate the rigorous study of the gerrymandering problem from
the perspectives of parameterized and fine-grained complexity and provide
asymptotically matching lower and upper bounds on its computational complexity.

$k$ and $n$ only, unless Exponential Time Hypothesis (ETH) fails. Our lower

detect threats. In particular, it is essential to assess how actions and
strategies of the involved agents (voters, municipal office employees, mail
clerks) can influence the outcome of other agents' actions as well as the
overall outcome of the election. In this paper, we present our first attempt to
capture those aspects in a formal multi-agent model of the Polish presidential

universally available in Poland. Unfortunately, the voting scheme was prepared
under time pressure and political pressure, and without the involvement of

real ballots of any strict subset of districts at a price corresponding to the
willingness to sell on the part of the citizens holding such ballots. By
contrast, decoy voters are trapped into selling their ballots at a low, or even
negligible, price. Blowing up the adversary's budget by introducing decoy

375,The ATHENA Class of Risk-Limiting Ballot Polling Audits,"The main risk-limiting ballot polling audit in use today, BRAVO, is designed
for use when single ballots are drawn at random and a decision regarding
whether to stop the audit or draw another ballot is taken after each ballot
draw (ballot-by-ballot (B2) audits). On the other hand, real ballot polling
audits draw many ballots in a single round before determining whether to stop
(round-by-round (R2) audits). We show that BRAVO results in significant
inefficiency when directly applied to real R2 audits. We present the ATHENA
class of R2 stopping rules, which we show are risk-limiting if the round
schedule is pre-determined (before the audit begins). We prove that each rule
is at least as efficient as the corresponding BRAVO stopping rule applied at
the end of the round. We have open-source software libraries implementing most
of our results.
  We show that ATHENA halves the number of ballots required, for all state
margins in the 2016 US Presidential election and a first round with $90\%$
stopping probability, when compared to BRAVO (stopping rule applied at the end
of the round). We present simulation results supporting the 90% stopping
probability claims and our claims for the risk accrued in the first round.
Further, ATHENA reduces the number of ballots by more than a quarter for low
margins, when compared to the BRAVO stopping rule applied on ballots in
selection order. This implies that keeping track of the order when drawing
ballots R2 is not beneficial, because ATHENA is more efficient even without
information on selection order. These results are significant because current
approaches to real ballot polling election audits use the B2 BRAVO rules,
requiring about twice as much work on the part of election officials. Applying
the rules in selection order requires fewer ballots, but keeping track of the
order, and entering it into audit software, adds to the effort.",2008.02315v5,cs.CR,2020-08-05 18:47:37+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Filip Zagórski'), arxiv.Result.Author('Grant McClearn'), arxiv.Result.Author('Sarah Morin'), arxiv.Result.Author('Neal McBurnett'), arxiv.Result.Author('Poorvi L.

not require identification numbers on the ballots or counting many ballots per

is correct, if the CVRs reflect voters' intentions with sufficient accuracy;
(2) shrouding a mapping between ballots and the CVRs for those ballots to

380,Can Voters Detect Errors on Their Printed Ballots? Absolutely,"There is still debate on whether voters can detect malicious changes in their
printed ballot after making their selections on a Ballot Marking Device (BMD).
In this study, we altered votes on a voter's ballot after they had made their
selections on a BMD. We then required them to examine their ballots for any
changes from the slate they used to vote. Overall accuracy was exceptionally
high. Participants saw 1440 total contests, and of those 1440, there were a
total of 4 errors, so total accuracy was 99.8%. Participants were able to
perform with near-perfect accuracy regardless of ballot length, ballot type,
number of altered races, and location of altered races. Detection performance
was extremely robust. We conclude that with proper direction and resources,
voters can be near-perfect detectors of ballot changes on printed paper ballots
after voting with a BMD. This finding has significant implications for the
voting community as BMD use continues to grow. Research should now focus on
identifying administrative and behavioral methods that will prompt and
encourage voters to check their BMD-generated ballots before they drop them in

substantially grown, and in response, many election officials have added new
drop boxes to their voting infrastructure. However, existing guidance for
locating drop boxes is limited. In this paper, we introduce an integer
programming model, the drop box location problem (DBLP), to locate drop boxes.
The DBLP considers criteria of cost, voter access, and risk. The cost of the
drop box system is determined by the fixed cost of adding drop boxes and the
operational cost of a collection tour by a bipartisan team who regularly
collects ballots from selected locations. The DBLP utilizes covering sets to
ensure each voter is in close proximity to a drop box and incorporates a novel
measure of access to measure the ability to use multiple voting pathways to
vote. The DBLP is shown to be NP-Hard, and we introduce a heuristic to generate
a large number of feasible solutions for policy makers to select from a
posteriori. Using a real-world case study of Milwaukee, WI, we study the
benefit of the DBLP. The results demonstrate that the proposed optimization
model identifies drop box locations that perform well across multiple criteria.
The results also demonstrate that the trade-off between cost, access, and risk
is non-trivial, which supports the use of the proposed optimization-based
approach to select drop box locations.",2207.10707v2,math.OC,2022-07-21 18:41:38+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Adam P. Schmidt'), arxiv.Result.Author('Laura A. Albert')]",

384,Limiting Risk by Turning Manifest Phantoms into Evil Zombies,"Drawing a random sample of ballots to conduct a risk-limiting audit generally
requires knowing how the ballots cast in an election are organized into groups,
for instance, how many containers of ballots there are in all and how many
ballots are in each container. A list of the ballot group identifiers along
with number of ballots in each group is called a ballot manifest. What if the
ballot manifest is not accurate? Surprisingly, even if ballots are known to be
missing from the manifest, it is not necessary to make worst-case assumptions
about those ballots--for instance, to adjust the margin by the number of
missing ballots--to ensure that the audit remains conservative. Rather, it
suffices to make worst-case assumptions about the individual randomly selected
ballots that the audit cannot find. This observation provides a simple
modification to some risk-limiting audit procedures that makes them
automatically become more conservative if the ballot manifest has errors. The
modification--phantoms to evil zombies (~2EZ)--requires only an upper bound on
the total number of ballots cast. ~2EZ makes the audit P-value stochastically
larger than it would be had the manifest been accurate, automatically requiring
more than enough ballots to be audited to offset the manifest errors. This
ensures that the true risk limit remains smaller than the nominal risk limit.
On the other hand, if the manifest is in fact accurate and the upper bound on
the total number of ballots equals the total according to the manifest, ~2EZ
has no effect at all on the number of ballots audited nor on the true risk
limit.",1207.3413v1,stat.AP,2012-07-14 11:26:02+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Jorge H. Banuelos'), arxiv.Result.Author('Philip B. Stark')]",

locations in order to achieve a political advantage for a particular party.
Lewenberg, Lev, and Rosenschein [AAMAS 2017] initiated the algorithmic study of
a geographically-based manipulation problem, where voters must vote at the
ballot box closest to them. In this variant of gerrymandering, for a given set
of possible locations of ballot boxes and known political preferences of $n$
voters, the task is to identify locations for $k$ boxes out of $m$ possible
locations to guarantee victory of a certain party in at least $l$ districts.
Here integers $k$ and $l$ are some selected parameter.
  It is known that the problem is NP-complete already for 4 political parties
and prior to our work only heuristic algorithms for this problem were
developed. We initiate the rigorous study of the gerrymandering problem from
the perspectives of parameterized and fine-grained complexity and provide
asymptotically matching lower and upper bounds on its computational complexity.
We prove that the problem is W[1]-hard parameterized by $k+n$ and that it does
not admit an $f(n,k)\cdot m^{o(\sqrt{k})}$ algorithm for any function $f$ of
$k$ and $n$ only, unless Exponential Time Hypothesis (ETH) fails. Our lower
bounds hold already for $2$ parties. On the other hand, we give an algorithm

malevolent adversary trying to buy real ballots. If the citizenry is divided
into subgroups (or districts), the adversary can construct a so-called ""Devil's
Menu"" consisting of several prices. In equilibrium, the adversary can buy the
real ballots of any strict subset of districts at a price corresponding to the
willingness to sell on the part of the citizens holding such ballots. By
contrast, decoy voters are trapped into selling their ballots at a low, or even
negligible, price. Blowing up the adversary's budget by introducing decoy
ballots may thus turn out to be futile. The Devil's Menu can also be applied to
the well-known ""Lemons Problem"".",1712.05477v1,cs.GT,2017-12-14 23:54:58+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Hans Gersbach'), arxiv.Result.Author('Akaki Mamageishvili'), arxiv.Result.Author('Oriol Tejada')]",
391,The ATHENA Class of Risk-Limiting Ballot Polling Audits,"The main risk-limiting ballot polling audit in use today, BRAVO, is designed
for use when single ballots are drawn at random and a decision regarding
whether to stop the audit or draw another ballot is taken after each ballot
draw (ballot-by-ballot (B2) audits). On the other hand, real ballot polling
audits draw many ballots in a single round before determining whether to stop
(round-by-round (R2) audits). We show that BRAVO results in significant
inefficiency when directly applied to real R2 audits. We present the ATHENA
class of R2 stopping rules, which we show are risk-limiting if the round
schedule is pre-determined (before the audit begins). We prove that each rule
is at least as efficient as the corresponding BRAVO stopping rule applied at
the end of the round. We have open-source software libraries implementing most
of our results.
  We show that ATHENA halves the number of ballots required, for all state
margins in the 2016 US Presidential election and a first round with $90\%$
stopping probability, when compared to BRAVO (stopping rule applied at the end
of the round). We present simulation results supporting the 90% stopping
probability claims and our claims for the risk accrued in the first round.
Further, ATHENA reduces the number of ballots by more than a quarter for low
margins, when compared to the BRAVO stopping rule applied on ballots in
selection order. This implies that keeping track of the order when drawing
ballots R2 is not beneficial, because ATHENA is more efficient even without
information on selection order. These results are significant because current
approaches to real ballot polling election audits use the B2 BRAVO rules,
requiring about twice as much work on the part of election officials. Applying
the rules in selection order requires fewer ballots, but keeping track of the
order, and entering it into audit software, adds to the effort.",2008.02315v5,cs.CR,2020-08-05 18:47:37+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Filip Zagórski'), arxiv.Result.Author('Grant McClearn'), arxiv.Result.Author('Sarah Morin'), arxiv.Result.Author('Neal McBurnett'), arxiv.Result.Author('Poorvi L.

Our method involves doing $k$ ""cuts"", each involving moving a random portion of
ballots from the top to the bottom of the stack, and then picking the ballot on
top. Unlike conventional methods of picking a ballot at random, $k$-cut does
not require identification numbers on the ballots or counting many ballots per
draw. We analyze how close the distribution of chosen ballots is to the uniform
distribution, and design different mitigation procedures. We show that $k=6$

Results indicated that of those voters who chose to examine the printed ballot,

400,"More style, less work: card-style data decrease risk-limiting audit sample sizes","U.S. elections rely heavily on computers such as voter registration
databases, electronic pollbooks, voting machines, scanners, tabulators, and
results reporting websites. These introduce digital threats to election
outcomes. Risk-limiting audits (RLAs) mitigate threats to some of these systems
by manually inspecting random samples of ballot cards. RLAs have a large chance
of correcting wrong outcomes (by conducting a full manual tabulation of a
trustworthy record of the votes), but can save labor when reported outcomes are
correct. This efficiency is eroded when sampling cannot be targeted to ballot
cards that contain the contest(s) under audit. If the sample is drawn from all
cast cards, RLA sample sizes scale like the reciprocal of the fraction of
ballot cards that contain the contest(s) under audit. That fraction shrinks as
the number of cards per ballot grows (i.e., when elections contain more
contests) and as the fraction of ballots that contain the contest decreases
(i.e., when a smaller percentage of voters are eligible to vote in the
contest). States that conduct RLAs of contests on multi-card ballots or of
small contests can dramatically reduce sample sizes by using information about
which ballot cards contain which contests -- by keeping track of card-style
data (CSD). For instance, CSD reduces the expected number of draws needed to
audit a single countywide contest on a 4-card ballot by 75%. Similarly, CSD
reduces the expected number of draws by 95% or more for an audit of two
contests with the same margin on a 4-card ballot if one contest is on every
ballot and the other is on 10% of ballots. In realistic examples, the savings
can be several orders of magnitude.",2012.03371v1,cs.CR,2020-12-06 20:35:12+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Amanda K. Glazer'), arxiv.Result.Author('Jacob V. Spertus'), arxiv.Result.Author('Philip B. Stark')]",

CVRs) from a trustworthy paper trail to a human interpretation of the same
cards. Such comparisons require the voting system to create and export CVRs in
a way that can be linked to the individual ballots the CVRs purport to
represent. Such links can be created by keeping the ballots in the order in
which they are scanned or by printing a unique serial number on each ballot.
But for precinct-count systems (PCOS), these strategies may compromise vote
anonymity: the order in which ballots are cast may identify the voters who cast
them. Printing a unique pseudo-random number (""cryptographic nonce"") on each
ballot card after the voter last touches it could reduce such privacy risks.
But what if the system does not in fact print a unique number on each ballot or
does not accurately report the numbers it printed? This paper gives two ways to
conduct an RLA so that even if the system does not print a genuine nonce on
each ballot or misreports the nonces it used, the audit's risk limit is not
compromised (however, the anonymity of votes might be compromised). One method
allows untrusted technology to be used to imprint and to retrieve ballot cards.
The method is adaptive: if the technology behaves properly, this protection
does not increase the audit workload. But if the imprinting or retrieval system
misbehaves, the sample size the RLA requires to confirm the reported results
when the results are correct is generally larger than if the imprinting and
retrieval were accurate.",2207.01362v1,cs.CR,2022-07-04 12:35:42+00:00,[arxiv.Result.Author('Philip B. Stark')],
402,Sets of Half-Average Nulls Generate Risk-Limiting Audits: SHANGRLA,"Risk-limiting audits (RLAs) for many social choice functions can be reduced
to testing sets of null hypotheses of the form ""the average of this list is not
greater than 1/2"" for a collection of finite lists of nonnegative numbers. Such
social choice functions include majority, super-majority, plurality,
multi-winner plurality, Instant Runoff Voting (IRV), Borda count, approval
voting, and STAR-Voting, among others. The audit stops without a full hand
count iff all the null hypotheses are rejected. The nulls can be tested in many
ways. Ballot-polling is particularly simple; two new ballot-polling
risk-measuring functions for sampling without replacement are given.
Ballot-level comparison audits transform each null into an equivalent assertion
that the mean of re-scaled tabulation errors is not greater than 1/2. In turn,
that null can then be tested using the same statistical methods used for ballot
polling---but applied to different finite lists of nonnegative numbers.
SHANGRLA comparison audits are more efficient than previous comparison audits
for two reasons: (i) for most social choice functions, the conditions tested
are both necessary and sufficient for the reported outcome to be correct, while
previous methods tested conditions that were sufficient but not necessary, and
(ii) the tests avoid a conservative approximation. The SHANGRLA abstraction
simplifies stratified audits, including audits that combine ballot polling with
ballot-level comparisons, producing sharper audits than the ""SUITE"" approach.
SHANGRLA works with the ""phantoms to evil zombies"" strategy to treat missing
ballot cards and missing or redacted cast vote records. That also facilitates
sampling from ""ballot-style manifests,"" which can dramatically improve
efficiency when the audited contests do not appear on every ballot card.

404,A Unified Evaluation of Two-Candidate Ballot-Polling Election Auditing Methods,"Counting votes is complex and error-prone. Several statistical methods have
been developed to assess election accuracy by manually inspecting randomly
selected physical ballots. Two 'principled' methods are risk-limiting audits
(RLAs) and Bayesian audits (BAs). RLAs use frequentist statistical inference
while BAs are based on Bayesian inference. Until recently, the two have been
thought of as fundamentally different.
  We present results that unify and shed light upon 'ballot-polling' RLAs and
BAs (which only require the ability to sample uniformly at random from all cast
ballot cards) for two-candidate plurality contests, which are building blocks
for auditing more complex social choice functions, including some preferential
voting systems. We highlight the connections between the methods and explore
their performance.
  First, building on a previous demonstration of the mathematical equivalence
of classical and Bayesian approaches, we show that BAs, suitably calibrated,
are risk-limiting. Second, we compare the efficiency of the methods across a
wide range of contest sizes and margins, focusing on the distribution of sample
sizes required to attain a given risk limit. Third, we outline several ways to
improve performance and show how the mathematical equivalence explains the
improvements.",2008.08536v2,stat.AP,2020-08-19 16:30:03+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Zhuoqun Huang'), arxiv.Result.Author('Ronald L. Rivest'), arxiv.Result.Author('Philip B.

405,Limiting Risk by Turning Manifest Phantoms into Evil Zombies,"Drawing a random sample of ballots to conduct a risk-limiting audit generally
requires knowing how the ballots cast in an election are organized into groups,
for instance, how many containers of ballots there are in all and how many
ballots are in each container. A list of the ballot group identifiers along
with number of ballots in each group is called a ballot manifest. What if the
ballot manifest is not accurate? Surprisingly, even if ballots are known to be
missing from the manifest, it is not necessary to make worst-case assumptions
about those ballots--for instance, to adjust the margin by the number of
missing ballots--to ensure that the audit remains conservative. Rather, it
suffices to make worst-case assumptions about the individual randomly selected
ballots that the audit cannot find. This observation provides a simple
modification to some risk-limiting audit procedures that makes them
automatically become more conservative if the ballot manifest has errors. The
modification--phantoms to evil zombies (~2EZ)--requires only an upper bound on
the total number of ballots cast. ~2EZ makes the audit P-value stochastically
larger than it would be had the manifest been accurate, automatically requiring
more than enough ballots to be audited to offset the manifest errors. This
ensures that the true risk limit remains smaller than the nominal risk limit.
On the other hand, if the manifest is in fact accurate and the upper bound on
the total number of ballots equals the total according to the manifest, ~2EZ
has no effect at all on the number of ballots audited nor on the true risk
limit.",1207.3413v1,stat.AP,2012-07-14 11:26:02+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Jorge H. Banuelos'), arxiv.Result.Author('Philip B. Stark')]",

was extremely robust. We conclude that with proper direction and resources,
voters can be near-perfect detectors of ballot changes on printed paper ballots

into subgroups (or districts), the adversary can construct a so-called ""Devil's
Menu"" consisting of several prices. In equilibrium, the adversary can buy the
real ballots of any strict subset of districts at a price corresponding to the
willingness to sell on the part of the citizens holding such ballots. By
contrast, decoy voters are trapped into selling their ballots at a low, or even
negligible, price. Blowing up the adversary's budget by introducing decoy
ballots may thus turn out to be futile. The Devil's Menu can also be applied to

410,The ATHENA Class of Risk-Limiting Ballot Polling Audits,"The main risk-limiting ballot polling audit in use today, BRAVO, is designed
for use when single ballots are drawn at random and a decision regarding
whether to stop the audit or draw another ballot is taken after each ballot
draw (ballot-by-ballot (B2) audits). On the other hand, real ballot polling
audits draw many ballots in a single round before determining whether to stop
(round-by-round (R2) audits). We show that BRAVO results in significant
inefficiency when directly applied to real R2 audits. We present the ATHENA
class of R2 stopping rules, which we show are risk-limiting if the round
schedule is pre-determined (before the audit begins). We prove that each rule
is at least as efficient as the corresponding BRAVO stopping rule applied at
the end of the round. We have open-source software libraries implementing most
of our results.
  We show that ATHENA halves the number of ballots required, for all state
margins in the 2016 US Presidential election and a first round with $90\%$
stopping probability, when compared to BRAVO (stopping rule applied at the end
of the round). We present simulation results supporting the 90% stopping
probability claims and our claims for the risk accrued in the first round.
Further, ATHENA reduces the number of ballots by more than a quarter for low
margins, when compared to the BRAVO stopping rule applied on ballots in
selection order. This implies that keeping track of the order when drawing
ballots R2 is not beneficial, because ATHENA is more efficient even without
information on selection order. These results are significant because current
approaches to real ballot polling election audits use the B2 BRAVO rules,
requiring about twice as much work on the part of election officials. Applying
the rules in selection order requires fewer ballots, but keeping track of the
order, and entering it into audit software, adds to the effort.",2008.02315v5,cs.CR,2020-08-05 18:47:37+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Filip Zagórski'), arxiv.Result.Author('Grant McClearn'), arxiv.Result.Author('Sarah Morin'), arxiv.Result.Author('Neal McBurnett'), arxiv.Result.Author('Poorvi L.

Our method involves doing $k$ ""cuts"", each involving moving a random portion of
ballots from the top to the bottom of the stack, and then picking the ballot on
top. Unlike conventional methods of picking a ballot at random, $k$-cut does
not require identification numbers on the ballots or counting many ballots per
draw. We analyze how close the distribution of chosen ballots is to the uniform
distribution, and design different mitigation procedures. We show that $k=6$

different locations, rather than requiring a central authority to select the

sampling; (3) it can start in polling places on election night, before margins
are known. If the reported margins for the 2016 U.S. Presidential election are
correct, a Bernoulli ballot-polling audit with a risk limit of 5% and a
sampling rate of $p_0 = 1\%$ would have had at least a 99% probability of

ballot tilings form a subset in the set of symmetric Dyck tilings, we construct
an inclusive map from labeled trees for ballot tilings to labeled trees for

justifiably high confidence that the reported results of an election are
consistent with an audit trail (""ballots""), which can be paper or electronic.
SOBA combines three ideas: (1) publishing cast vote records (CVRs) separately
for each contest, so that anyone can verify that each reported contest outcome
is correct, if the CVRs reflect voters' intentions with sufficient accuracy;
(2) shrouding a mapping between ballots and the CVRs for those ballots to
prevent the loss of privacy that could occur otherwise; (3) assessing the
accuracy with which the CVRs reflect voters' intentions for a collection of
contests while simultaneously assessing the integrity of the shrouded mapping
between ballots and CVRs by comparing randomly selected ballots to the CVRs
that purport to represent them. Step (1) is related to work by the Humboldt
County Election Transparency Project, but publishing CVRs separately for
individual contests rather than images of entire ballots preserves privacy.
Step (2) requires a cryptographic commitment from elections officials.
Observers participate in step (3), which relies on the ""super-simple
simultaneous single-ballot risk-limiting audit."" Step (3) is designed to reveal
relatively few ballots if the shrouded mapping is proper and the CVRs
accurately reflect voter intent. But if the reported outcomes of the contests

421,Adaptive Risk-Limiting Ballot Comparison Audits,"Risk-limiting audits (RLAs) are rigorous statistical procedures meant to
detect invalid election results. RLAs examine paper ballots cast during the
election to statistically assess the possibility of a disagreement between the
winner determined by the ballots and the winner reported by tabulation. The
most ballot efficient approaches proceed by ""ballot comparison."" However,
ballot comparison requires an untrusted declaration of the contents of each
cast ballot, rather than a simple tabulation of vote totals. This ""cast-vote
record table"" (CVR) is then spot-checked against ballots for consistency. In
many practical settings, the cost of generating a suitable CVR dominates the
cost of conducting the audit, preventing widespread adoption of these
sample-efficient techniques.
  We introduce a new RLA procedure: an ""adaptive ballot comparison"" audit. In
this audit, a global CVR is never produced; instead, a three-stage procedure is
iterated:
  1) a batch is selected,
  2) a CVR is produced for that batch, and
  3) a ballot within the batch is sampled, inspected by auditors, and compared
with the CVR.
  We prove that such an audit can achieve risk commensurate with standard
comparison audits while generating a fraction of the CVR. We present three main
contributions:
  1) a formal adversarial model for RLAs;
  2) definition and analysis of an adaptive audit procedure with rigorous risk
limits and an associated correctness analysis accounting for the incidental
errors arising in typical audits; and
  3) an analysis of practical efficiency.
  This method can be organized in rounds (as is typical for comparison audits)
where sampled CVRs are produced in parallel. Using data from Florida's 2020
presidential election with 5% risk and 1% margin, only 22% of the CVR is

423,Bernoulli Ballot Polling: A Manifest Improvement for Risk-Limiting Audits,"We present a method and software for ballot-polling risk-limiting audits
(RLAs) based on Bernoulli sampling: ballots are included in the sample with
probability $p$, independently. Bernoulli sampling has several advantages: (1)
it does not require a ballot manifest; (2) it can be conducted independently at
different locations, rather than requiring a central authority to select the
sample from the whole population of cast ballots or requiring stratified
sampling; (3) it can start in polling places on election night, before margins
are known. If the reported margins for the 2016 U.S. Presidential election are
correct, a Bernoulli ballot-polling audit with a risk limit of 5% and a
sampling rate of $p_0 = 1\%$ would have had at least a 99% probability of
confirming the outcome in 42 states. (The other states were more likely to have
needed to examine additional ballots.) Logistical and security advantages that
auditing in the polling place affords may outweigh the cost of examining more
ballots than some other methods might require.",1812.06361v1,stat.AP,2018-12-15 21:57:23+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Kellie Ottoboni'), arxiv.Result.Author('Matthew Bernhard'), arxiv.Result.Author('J.

424,SOBA: Secrecy-preserving Observable Ballot-level Audit,"SOBA is an approach to election verification that provides observers with
justifiably high confidence that the reported results of an election are
consistent with an audit trail (""ballots""), which can be paper or electronic.
SOBA combines three ideas: (1) publishing cast vote records (CVRs) separately
for each contest, so that anyone can verify that each reported contest outcome
is correct, if the CVRs reflect voters' intentions with sufficient accuracy;
(2) shrouding a mapping between ballots and the CVRs for those ballots to
prevent the loss of privacy that could occur otherwise; (3) assessing the
accuracy with which the CVRs reflect voters' intentions for a collection of
contests while simultaneously assessing the integrity of the shrouded mapping
between ballots and CVRs by comparing randomly selected ballots to the CVRs
that purport to represent them. Step (1) is related to work by the Humboldt
County Election Transparency Project, but publishing CVRs separately for
individual contests rather than images of entire ballots preserves privacy.
Step (2) requires a cryptographic commitment from elections officials.
Observers participate in step (3), which relies on the ""super-simple
simultaneous single-ballot risk-limiting audit."" Step (3) is designed to reveal
relatively few ballots if the shrouded mapping is proper and the CVRs
accurately reflect voter intent. But if the reported outcomes of the contests
differ from the outcomes that a full hand count would show, step (3) is
guaranteed to have a large chance of requiring all the ballots to be counted by
hand, thereby limiting the risk that an incorrect outcome will become official
and final.",1105.5803v2,stat.AP,2011-05-29 17:00:20+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Josh Benaloh'), arxiv.Result.Author('Douglas Jones'), arxiv.Result.Author('Eric Lazarus'), arxiv.Result.Author('Mark Lindeman'), arxiv.Result.Author('Philip B. Stark')]",

incorrect election results, independent of why the result was incorrect.
Ballot-polling audits select ballots at random and interpret those ballots as
evidence for and against the reported result, continuing this process until
either they support the recorded result, or they fall back to a full manual
recount. For elections with digitised scanning and counting of ballots, a
comparison audit compares randomly selected digital ballots with their paper
versions. Discrepancies are referred to as errors, and are used to build
evidence against or in support of the recorded result. Risk-limiting audits for
first-past-the-post elections are well understood, and used in some US
elections. We define a number of approaches to ballot-polling and comparison
risk-limiting audits for Instant Runoff Voting (IRV) elections. We show that
for almost all real elections we found, we can perform a risk-limiting audit by
looking at only a small fraction of the total ballots (assuming no errors were
made in the tallying and distribution of votes).",1903.08804v2,cs.DS,2019-03-20 06:19:10+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Michelle Blom'), arxiv.Result.Author('Peter J. Stuckey'), arxiv.Result.Author('Vanessa Teague')]",
426,"More style, less work: card-style data decrease risk-limiting audit sample sizes","U.S. elections rely heavily on computers such as voter registration
databases, electronic pollbooks, voting machines, scanners, tabulators, and
results reporting websites. These introduce digital threats to election
outcomes. Risk-limiting audits (RLAs) mitigate threats to some of these systems
by manually inspecting random samples of ballot cards. RLAs have a large chance
of correcting wrong outcomes (by conducting a full manual tabulation of a
trustworthy record of the votes), but can save labor when reported outcomes are
correct. This efficiency is eroded when sampling cannot be targeted to ballot
cards that contain the contest(s) under audit. If the sample is drawn from all
cast cards, RLA sample sizes scale like the reciprocal of the fraction of
ballot cards that contain the contest(s) under audit. That fraction shrinks as
the number of cards per ballot grows (i.e., when elections contain more
contests) and as the fraction of ballots that contain the contest decreases
(i.e., when a smaller percentage of voters are eligible to vote in the
contest). States that conduct RLAs of contests on multi-card ballots or of
small contests can dramatically reduce sample sizes by using information about
which ballot cards contain which contests -- by keeping track of card-style
data (CSD). For instance, CSD reduces the expected number of draws needed to
audit a single countywide contest on a 4-card ballot by 75%. Similarly, CSD
reduces the expected number of draws by 95% or more for an audit of two
contests with the same margin on a 4-card ballot if one contest is on every
ballot and the other is on 10% of ballots. In realistic examples, the savings
can be several orders of magnitude.",2012.03371v1,cs.CR,2020-12-06 20:35:12+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Amanda K. Glazer'), arxiv.Result.Author('Jacob V. Spertus'), arxiv.Result.Author('Philip B. Stark')]",
427,Non(c)esuch Ballot-Level Risk-Limiting Audits for Precinct-Count Voting Systems,"Risk-limiting audits (RLAs) guarantee a high probability of correcting
incorrect reported outcomes before the outcomes are certified. The most
efficient use ballot-level comparison, comparing the voting system's
interpretation of individual ballot cards sampled at random (cast-vote records,
CVRs) from a trustworthy paper trail to a human interpretation of the same
cards. Such comparisons require the voting system to create and export CVRs in
a way that can be linked to the individual ballots the CVRs purport to
represent. Such links can be created by keeping the ballots in the order in
which they are scanned or by printing a unique serial number on each ballot.
But for precinct-count systems (PCOS), these strategies may compromise vote
anonymity: the order in which ballots are cast may identify the voters who cast
them. Printing a unique pseudo-random number (""cryptographic nonce"") on each
ballot card after the voter last touches it could reduce such privacy risks.
But what if the system does not in fact print a unique number on each ballot or
does not accurately report the numbers it printed? This paper gives two ways to
conduct an RLA so that even if the system does not print a genuine nonce on
each ballot or misreports the nonces it used, the audit's risk limit is not
compromised (however, the anonymity of votes might be compromised). One method
allows untrusted technology to be used to imprint and to retrieve ballot cards.
The method is adaptive: if the technology behaves properly, this protection
does not increase the audit workload. But if the imprinting or retrieval system
misbehaves, the sample size the RLA requires to confirm the reported results
when the results are correct is generally larger than if the imprinting and
retrieval were accurate.",2207.01362v1,cs.CR,2022-07-04 12:35:42+00:00,[arxiv.Result.Author('Philip B. Stark')],
428,Risk-Limiting Audits by Stratified Union-Intersection Tests of Elections (SUITE),"Risk-limiting audits (RLAs) offer a statistical guarantee: if a full manual
tally of the paper ballots would show that the reported election outcome is
wrong, an RLA has a known minimum chance of leading to a full manual tally.
RLAs generally rely on random samples. Stratified sampling--partitioning the
population of ballots into disjoint strata and sampling independently from the
strata--may simplify logistics or increase efficiency compared to simpler
sampling designs, but makes risk calculations harder. We present SUITE, a new
method for conducting RLAs using stratified samples. SUITE considers all
possible partitions of outcome-changing error across strata. For each
partition, it combines P-values from stratum-level tests into a combined
P-value; there is no restriction on the tests used in different strata. SUITE
maximizes the combined P-value over all partitions of outcome-changing error.
The audit can stop if that maximum is less than the risk limit. Voting systems
in some Colorado counties (comprising 98.2% of voters) allow auditors to check
how the system interpreted each ballot, which allows ballot-level comparison
RLAs. Other counties use ballot polling, which is less efficient. Extant
approaches to conducting an RLA of a statewide contest would require major
changes to Colorado's procedures and software, or would sacrifice the
efficiency of ballot-level comparison. SUITE does not. It divides ballots into
two strata: those cast in counties that can conduct ballot-level comparisons,
and the rest. Stratum-level P-values are found by methods derived here. The
resulting audit is substantially more efficient than statewide ballot polling.
SUITE is useful in any state with a mix of voting systems or that uses
stratified sampling for other reasons. We provide an open-source reference
implementation and exemplar calculations in Jupyter notebooks.",1809.04235v1,stat.AP,2018-09-12 02:56:22+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Kellie Ottoboni'), arxiv.Result.Author('Philip B. Stark'), arxiv.Result.Author('Mark Lindeman'), arxiv.Result.Author('Neal McBurnett')]",
429,Sets of Half-Average Nulls Generate Risk-Limiting Audits: SHANGRLA,"Risk-limiting audits (RLAs) for many social choice functions can be reduced
to testing sets of null hypotheses of the form ""the average of this list is not
greater than 1/2"" for a collection of finite lists of nonnegative numbers. Such
social choice functions include majority, super-majority, plurality,
multi-winner plurality, Instant Runoff Voting (IRV), Borda count, approval
voting, and STAR-Voting, among others. The audit stops without a full hand
count iff all the null hypotheses are rejected. The nulls can be tested in many
ways. Ballot-polling is particularly simple; two new ballot-polling
risk-measuring functions for sampling without replacement are given.
Ballot-level comparison audits transform each null into an equivalent assertion
that the mean of re-scaled tabulation errors is not greater than 1/2. In turn,
that null can then be tested using the same statistical methods used for ballot
polling---but applied to different finite lists of nonnegative numbers.
SHANGRLA comparison audits are more efficient than previous comparison audits
for two reasons: (i) for most social choice functions, the conditions tested
are both necessary and sufficient for the reported outcome to be correct, while
previous methods tested conditions that were sufficient but not necessary, and
(ii) the tests avoid a conservative approximation. The SHANGRLA abstraction
simplifies stratified audits, including audits that combine ballot polling with
ballot-level comparisons, producing sharper audits than the ""SUITE"" approach.
SHANGRLA works with the ""phantoms to evil zombies"" strategy to treat missing
ballot cards and missing or redacted cast vote records. That also facilitates
sampling from ""ballot-style manifests,"" which can dramatically improve
efficiency when the audited contests do not appear on every ballot card.

such that a learner does not need matching $accept$ messages sent in the $same

modification preserves the original safety and liveness guarantees of Paxos. We
define $Consecutive \; Paxos$ which encapsulates the properties of discrete
consecutive ballots. To establish the correctness of these results, we, in

real ballots of any strict subset of districts at a price corresponding to the
willingness to sell on the part of the citizens holding such ballots. By
contrast, decoy voters are trapped into selling their ballots at a low, or even
negligible, price. Blowing up the adversary's budget by introducing decoy
ballots may thus turn out to be futile. The Devil's Menu can also be applied to

436,The ATHENA Class of Risk-Limiting Ballot Polling Audits,"The main risk-limiting ballot polling audit in use today, BRAVO, is designed
for use when single ballots are drawn at random and a decision regarding
whether to stop the audit or draw another ballot is taken after each ballot
draw (ballot-by-ballot (B2) audits). On the other hand, real ballot polling
audits draw many ballots in a single round before determining whether to stop
(round-by-round (R2) audits). We show that BRAVO results in significant
inefficiency when directly applied to real R2 audits. We present the ATHENA
class of R2 stopping rules, which we show are risk-limiting if the round
schedule is pre-determined (before the audit begins). We prove that each rule
is at least as efficient as the corresponding BRAVO stopping rule applied at
the end of the round. We have open-source software libraries implementing most
of our results.
  We show that ATHENA halves the number of ballots required, for all state
margins in the 2016 US Presidential election and a first round with $90\%$
stopping probability, when compared to BRAVO (stopping rule applied at the end
of the round). We present simulation results supporting the 90% stopping
probability claims and our claims for the risk accrued in the first round.
Further, ATHENA reduces the number of ballots by more than a quarter for low
margins, when compared to the BRAVO stopping rule applied on ballots in
selection order. This implies that keeping track of the order when drawing
ballots R2 is not beneficial, because ATHENA is more efficient even without
information on selection order. These results are significant because current
approaches to real ballot polling election audits use the B2 BRAVO rules,
requiring about twice as much work on the part of election officials. Applying
the rules in selection order requires fewer ballots, but keeping track of the
order, and entering it into audit software, adds to the effort.",2008.02315v5,cs.CR,2020-08-05 18:47:37+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Filip Zagórski'), arxiv.Result.Author('Grant McClearn'), arxiv.Result.Author('Sarah Morin'), arxiv.Result.Author('Neal McBurnett'), arxiv.Result.Author('Poorvi L.

show that decoy ballots may not provide effective protection against a
malevolent adversary trying to buy real ballots. If the citizenry is divided
into subgroups (or districts), the adversary can construct a so-called ""Devil's
Menu"" consisting of several prices. In equilibrium, the adversary can buy the
real ballots of any strict subset of districts at a price corresponding to the
willingness to sell on the part of the citizens holding such ballots. By
contrast, decoy voters are trapped into selling their ballots at a low, or even
negligible, price. Blowing up the adversary's budget by introducing decoy

446,The ATHENA Class of Risk-Limiting Ballot Polling Audits,"The main risk-limiting ballot polling audit in use today, BRAVO, is designed
for use when single ballots are drawn at random and a decision regarding
whether to stop the audit or draw another ballot is taken after each ballot
draw (ballot-by-ballot (B2) audits). On the other hand, real ballot polling
audits draw many ballots in a single round before determining whether to stop
(round-by-round (R2) audits). We show that BRAVO results in significant
inefficiency when directly applied to real R2 audits. We present the ATHENA
class of R2 stopping rules, which we show are risk-limiting if the round
schedule is pre-determined (before the audit begins). We prove that each rule
is at least as efficient as the corresponding BRAVO stopping rule applied at
the end of the round. We have open-source software libraries implementing most
of our results.
  We show that ATHENA halves the number of ballots required, for all state
margins in the 2016 US Presidential election and a first round with $90\%$
stopping probability, when compared to BRAVO (stopping rule applied at the end
of the round). We present simulation results supporting the 90% stopping
probability claims and our claims for the risk accrued in the first round.
Further, ATHENA reduces the number of ballots by more than a quarter for low
margins, when compared to the BRAVO stopping rule applied on ballots in
selection order. This implies that keeping track of the order when drawing
ballots R2 is not beneficial, because ATHENA is more efficient even without
information on selection order. These results are significant because current
approaches to real ballot polling election audits use the B2 BRAVO rules,
requiring about twice as much work on the part of election officials. Applying
the rules in selection order requires fewer ballots, but keeping track of the
order, and entering it into audit software, adds to the effort.",2008.02315v5,cs.CR,2020-08-05 18:47:37+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Filip Zagórski'), arxiv.Result.Author('Grant McClearn'), arxiv.Result.Author('Sarah Morin'), arxiv.Result.Author('Neal McBurnett'), arxiv.Result.Author('Poorvi L.

not require identification numbers on the ballots or counting many ballots per

justifiably high confidence that the reported results of an election are
consistent with an audit trail (""ballots""), which can be paper or electronic.
SOBA combines three ideas: (1) publishing cast vote records (CVRs) separately
for each contest, so that anyone can verify that each reported contest outcome
is correct, if the CVRs reflect voters' intentions with sufficient accuracy;
(2) shrouding a mapping between ballots and the CVRs for those ballots to
prevent the loss of privacy that could occur otherwise; (3) assessing the
accuracy with which the CVRs reflect voters' intentions for a collection of
contests while simultaneously assessing the integrity of the shrouded mapping
between ballots and CVRs by comparing randomly selected ballots to the CVRs
that purport to represent them. Step (1) is related to work by the Humboldt
County Election Transparency Project, but publishing CVRs separately for
individual contests rather than images of entire ballots preserves privacy.
Step (2) requires a cryptographic commitment from elections officials.
Observers participate in step (3), which relies on the ""super-simple
simultaneous single-ballot risk-limiting audit."" Step (3) is designed to reveal
relatively few ballots if the shrouded mapping is proper and the CVRs
accurately reflect voter intent. But if the reported outcomes of the contests

Recent studies (e.g., Bernhard, et al. 2020) suggest the verification rate is

of voters being unable to do so accurately or whether this is because voters
simply choose not to attempt verification in the first place. In order to
understand this problem, we conducted an experiment in which 108 participants
participated in a mock election where the BMD displayed the voters' true
choices, but then changed a subset of those choices on the printed ballot. The
design of the printed ballot, the length of the ballot, the number of changes
that were made to the ballot, the location of those changes, and the
instructions provided to the voters were manipulated as part of the experiment.
Results indicated that of those voters who chose to examine the printed ballot,
76% detected anomalies, indicating that voters can reliably detect errors on
their ballot if they will simply review it. This suggests that administrative

evidence against or in support of the recorded result. Risk-limiting audits for
first-past-the-post elections are well understood, and used in some US
elections. We define a number of approaches to ballot-polling and comparison
risk-limiting audits for Instant Runoff Voting (IRV) elections. We show that

traditional plurality voting in which voters submit rankings over the

on their ballot. We theoretically and empirically analyze how ballot length can
influence the outcome of an election, given fixed voter preferences. We show
that there exist preference profiles over $k$ candidates such that up to $k-1$
different candidates win at different ballot lengths. We derive exact lower
bounds on the number of voters required for such profiles and provide a
construction matching the lower bound for unrestricted voter preferences.
Additionally, we characterize which sequences of winners are possible over
ballot lengths and provide explicit profile constructions achieving any
feasible winner sequence. We also examine how classic preference restrictions
influence our results--for instance, single-peakedness makes $k-1$ different
winners impossible but still allows at least $\Omega(\sqrt k)$. Finally, we
analyze a collection of 168 real-world elections, where we truncate rankings to
simulate shorter ballots. We find that shorter ballots could have changed the
outcome in one quarter of these elections. Our results highlight ballot length

requires knowing how the ballots cast in an election are organized into groups,
for instance, how many containers of ballots there are in all and how many
ballots are in each container. A list of the ballot group identifiers along
with number of ballots in each group is called a ballot manifest. What if the
ballot manifest is not accurate? Surprisingly, even if ballots are known to be
missing from the manifest, it is not necessary to make worst-case assumptions
about those ballots--for instance, to adjust the margin by the number of
missing ballots--to ensure that the audit remains conservative. Rather, it
suffices to make worst-case assumptions about the individual randomly selected
ballots that the audit cannot find. This observation provides a simple
modification to some risk-limiting audit procedures that makes them
automatically become more conservative if the ballot manifest has errors. The
modification--phantoms to evil zombies (~2EZ)--requires only an upper bound on
the total number of ballots cast. ~2EZ makes the audit P-value stochastically
larger than it would be had the manifest been accurate, automatically requiring
more than enough ballots to be audited to offset the manifest errors. This
ensures that the true risk limit remains smaller than the nominal risk limit.
On the other hand, if the manifest is in fact accurate and the upper bound on
the total number of ballots equals the total according to the manifest, ~2EZ

strategies of the involved agents (voters, municipal office employees, mail
clerks) can influence the outcome of other agents' actions as well as the
overall outcome of the election. In this paper, we present our first attempt to
capture those aspects in a formal multi-agent model of the Polish presidential

universally available in Poland. Unfortunately, the voting scheme was prepared
under time pressure and political pressure, and without the involvement of

perform with near-perfect accuracy regardless of ballot length, ballot type,

was extremely robust. We conclude that with proper direction and resources,
voters can be near-perfect detectors of ballot changes on printed paper ballots

traditional plurality voting in which voters submit rankings over the
candidates rather than single votes. In practice, elections using IRV often
restrict the ballot length, the number of candidates a voter is allowed to rank
on their ballot. We theoretically and empirically analyze how ballot length can
influence the outcome of an election, given fixed voter preferences. We show
that there exist preference profiles over $k$ candidates such that up to $k-1$
different candidates win at different ballot lengths. We derive exact lower
bounds on the number of voters required for such profiles and provide a
construction matching the lower bound for unrestricted voter preferences.
Additionally, we characterize which sequences of winners are possible over
ballot lengths and provide explicit profile constructions achieving any
feasible winner sequence. We also examine how classic preference restrictions
influence our results--for instance, single-peakedness makes $k-1$ different
winners impossible but still allows at least $\Omega(\sqrt k)$. Finally, we
analyze a collection of 168 real-world elections, where we truncate rankings to
simulate shorter ballots. We find that shorter ballots could have changed the
outcome in one quarter of these elections. Our results highlight ballot length
as a consequential degree of freedom in the design of IRV elections.",2207.08958v3,cs.MA,2022-07-18 22:01:13+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Kiran Tomlinson'), arxiv.Result.Author('Johan Ugander'), arxiv.Result.Author('Jon Kleinberg')]",

480,Limiting Risk by Turning Manifest Phantoms into Evil Zombies,"Drawing a random sample of ballots to conduct a risk-limiting audit generally
requires knowing how the ballots cast in an election are organized into groups,
for instance, how many containers of ballots there are in all and how many
ballots are in each container. A list of the ballot group identifiers along
with number of ballots in each group is called a ballot manifest. What if the
ballot manifest is not accurate? Surprisingly, even if ballots are known to be
missing from the manifest, it is not necessary to make worst-case assumptions
about those ballots--for instance, to adjust the margin by the number of
missing ballots--to ensure that the audit remains conservative. Rather, it
suffices to make worst-case assumptions about the individual randomly selected
ballots that the audit cannot find. This observation provides a simple
modification to some risk-limiting audit procedures that makes them
automatically become more conservative if the ballot manifest has errors. The
modification--phantoms to evil zombies (~2EZ)--requires only an upper bound on
the total number of ballots cast. ~2EZ makes the audit P-value stochastically
larger than it would be had the manifest been accurate, automatically requiring
more than enough ballots to be audited to offset the manifest errors. This
ensures that the true risk limit remains smaller than the nominal risk limit.
On the other hand, if the manifest is in fact accurate and the upper bound on
the total number of ballots equals the total according to the manifest, ~2EZ
has no effect at all on the number of ballots audited nor on the true risk
limit.",1207.3413v1,stat.AP,2012-07-14 11:26:02+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Jorge H. Banuelos'), arxiv.Result.Author('Philip B. Stark')]",

relations and formulas, which leads to an interesting bijection between ballot
permutations avoiding $132$ and $312$ with left factors of Dyck paths. In
addition, we also conclude the Wilf-classification of ballot permutations

In this study, we altered votes on a voter's ballot after they had made their
selections on a BMD. We then required them to examine their ballots for any
changes from the slate they used to vote. Overall accuracy was exceptionally
high. Participants saw 1440 total contests, and of those 1440, there were a
total of 4 errors, so total accuracy was 99.8%. Participants were able to
perform with near-perfect accuracy regardless of ballot length, ballot type,
number of altered races, and location of altered races. Detection performance
was extremely robust. We conclude that with proper direction and resources,
voters can be near-perfect detectors of ballot changes on printed paper ballots
after voting with a BMD. This finding has significant implications for the
voting community as BMD use continues to grow. Research should now focus on
identifying administrative and behavioral methods that will prompt and
encourage voters to check their BMD-generated ballots before they drop them in

malevolent adversary trying to buy real ballots. If the citizenry is divided
into subgroups (or districts), the adversary can construct a so-called ""Devil's
Menu"" consisting of several prices. In equilibrium, the adversary can buy the
real ballots of any strict subset of districts at a price corresponding to the
willingness to sell on the part of the citizens holding such ballots. By
contrast, decoy voters are trapped into selling their ballots at a low, or even
negligible, price. Blowing up the adversary's budget by introducing decoy
ballots may thus turn out to be futile. The Devil's Menu can also be applied to
the well-known ""Lemons Problem"".",1712.05477v1,cs.GT,2017-12-14 23:54:58+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Hans Gersbach'), arxiv.Result.Author('Akaki Mamageishvili'), arxiv.Result.Author('Oriol Tejada')]",
485,The ATHENA Class of Risk-Limiting Ballot Polling Audits,"The main risk-limiting ballot polling audit in use today, BRAVO, is designed
for use when single ballots are drawn at random and a decision regarding
whether to stop the audit or draw another ballot is taken after each ballot
draw (ballot-by-ballot (B2) audits). On the other hand, real ballot polling
audits draw many ballots in a single round before determining whether to stop
(round-by-round (R2) audits). We show that BRAVO results in significant
inefficiency when directly applied to real R2 audits. We present the ATHENA
class of R2 stopping rules, which we show are risk-limiting if the round
schedule is pre-determined (before the audit begins). We prove that each rule
is at least as efficient as the corresponding BRAVO stopping rule applied at
the end of the round. We have open-source software libraries implementing most
of our results.
  We show that ATHENA halves the number of ballots required, for all state
margins in the 2016 US Presidential election and a first round with $90\%$
stopping probability, when compared to BRAVO (stopping rule applied at the end
of the round). We present simulation results supporting the 90% stopping
probability claims and our claims for the risk accrued in the first round.
Further, ATHENA reduces the number of ballots by more than a quarter for low
margins, when compared to the BRAVO stopping rule applied on ballots in
selection order. This implies that keeping track of the order when drawing
ballots R2 is not beneficial, because ATHENA is more efficient even without
information on selection order. These results are significant because current
approaches to real ballot polling election audits use the B2 BRAVO rules,
requiring about twice as much work on the part of election officials. Applying
the rules in selection order requires fewer ballots, but keeping track of the
order, and entering it into audit software, adds to the effort.",2008.02315v5,cs.CR,2020-08-05 18:47:37+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Filip Zagórski'), arxiv.Result.Author('Grant McClearn'), arxiv.Result.Author('Sarah Morin'), arxiv.Result.Author('Neal McBurnett'), arxiv.Result.Author('Poorvi L.

incorrect election results, independent of why the result was incorrect.
Ballot-polling audits select ballots at random and interpret those ballots as
evidence for and against the reported result, continuing this process until
either they support the recorded result, or they fall back to a full manual
recount. For elections with digitised scanning and counting of ballots, a
comparison audit compares randomly selected digital ballots with their paper
versions. Discrepancies are referred to as errors, and are used to build
evidence against or in support of the recorded result. Risk-limiting audits for
first-past-the-post elections are well understood, and used in some US
elections. We define a number of approaches to ballot-polling and comparison
risk-limiting audits for Instant Runoff Voting (IRV) elections. We show that
for almost all real elections we found, we can perform a risk-limiting audit by
looking at only a small fraction of the total ballots (assuming no errors were
made in the tallying and distribution of votes).",1903.08804v2,cs.DS,2019-03-20 06:19:10+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Michelle Blom'), arxiv.Result.Author('Peter J. Stuckey'), arxiv.Result.Author('Vanessa Teague')]",

494,Ballot Length in Instant Runoff Voting,"Instant runoff voting (IRV) is an increasingly-popular alternative to
traditional plurality voting in which voters submit rankings over the
candidates rather than single votes. In practice, elections using IRV often
restrict the ballot length, the number of candidates a voter is allowed to rank
on their ballot. We theoretically and empirically analyze how ballot length can
influence the outcome of an election, given fixed voter preferences. We show
that there exist preference profiles over $k$ candidates such that up to $k-1$
different candidates win at different ballot lengths. We derive exact lower
bounds on the number of voters required for such profiles and provide a
construction matching the lower bound for unrestricted voter preferences.
Additionally, we characterize which sequences of winners are possible over
ballot lengths and provide explicit profile constructions achieving any
feasible winner sequence. We also examine how classic preference restrictions
influence our results--for instance, single-peakedness makes $k-1$ different
winners impossible but still allows at least $\Omega(\sqrt k)$. Finally, we
analyze a collection of 168 real-world elections, where we truncate rankings to
simulate shorter ballots. We find that shorter ballots could have changed the
outcome in one quarter of these elections. Our results highlight ballot length
as a consequential degree of freedom in the design of IRV elections.",2207.08958v3,cs.MA,2022-07-18 22:01:13+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Kiran Tomlinson'), arxiv.Result.Author('Johan Ugander'), arxiv.Result.Author('Jon Kleinberg')]",

shields for such electorates by allowing the voters to specify partial
preferences instead of insisting they cast complete ballots. In particular, we
show that in single-peaked and nearly single-peaked electorates, if voters are

503,How long is a piece of string? An exploration of multi-winner approval voting and ballot-length restrictions,"Multi-winner approval elections are seen in a variety of settings ranging

elections, it is often the case that ballot-length restrictions are enforced;
that is, where voters have a limit on the number of candidates which they can
vote for. Despite this common feature, there does not seem to be any
theoretical justification for ballot-length restrictions (Laslier and Van der
Straeten, 2016).
  This work endogenously derives the set of voter best-response ballot lengths
under complete information and with general assumptions on voter utilities and
voting rules. These results provide justification for some ballot-length
restrictions observed in practice, however when considering equilibrium
outcomes our analysis shows that this justification is no longer valid.
Equilibrium analysis is considered for voters with lazy and truth-bias
second-order tendencies and the equilibrium solution concept is pure-Nash
equilibria.
  The key insights show that ballot-length restrictions or institutional
features which make voting costly may lead to instability in election outcomes
when voters have diverse preferences, via the non-existence of equilibria. On
the other hand, when equilibria do exist they satisfy desirable properties
which are not guaranteed by equilibria attained under costless voting and in
the absence of ballot-length restrictions. In summary our results highlight a

507,Limiting Risk by Turning Manifest Phantoms into Evil Zombies,"Drawing a random sample of ballots to conduct a risk-limiting audit generally
requires knowing how the ballots cast in an election are organized into groups,
for instance, how many containers of ballots there are in all and how many
ballots are in each container. A list of the ballot group identifiers along
with number of ballots in each group is called a ballot manifest. What if the
ballot manifest is not accurate? Surprisingly, even if ballots are known to be
missing from the manifest, it is not necessary to make worst-case assumptions
about those ballots--for instance, to adjust the margin by the number of
missing ballots--to ensure that the audit remains conservative. Rather, it
suffices to make worst-case assumptions about the individual randomly selected
ballots that the audit cannot find. This observation provides a simple
modification to some risk-limiting audit procedures that makes them
automatically become more conservative if the ballot manifest has errors. The
modification--phantoms to evil zombies (~2EZ)--requires only an upper bound on
the total number of ballots cast. ~2EZ makes the audit P-value stochastically
larger than it would be had the manifest been accurate, automatically requiring
more than enough ballots to be audited to offset the manifest errors. This
ensures that the true risk limit remains smaller than the nominal risk limit.
On the other hand, if the manifest is in fact accurate and the upper bound on
the total number of ballots equals the total according to the manifest, ~2EZ
has no effect at all on the number of ballots audited nor on the true risk
limit.",1207.3413v1,stat.AP,2012-07-14 11:26:02+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Jorge H. Banuelos'), arxiv.Result.Author('Philip B. Stark')]",

changes from the slate they used to vote. Overall accuracy was exceptionally
high. Participants saw 1440 total contests, and of those 1440, there were a
total of 4 errors, so total accuracy was 99.8%. Participants were able to
perform with near-perfect accuracy regardless of ballot length, ballot type,
number of altered races, and location of altered races. Detection performance
was extremely robust. We conclude that with proper direction and resources,
voters can be near-perfect detectors of ballot changes on printed paper ballots

properties. We investigated the density of granules and their mean area derived
directly from the segmentation of deconvolved images from SDO/HMI. To perform
the segmentation, we define granules as convex elements of images. We measured
an approximately 2% variation in the density and the mean area of granules over
the cycle, the density of granules being greater at solar maximum with a
smaller granule mean area. The maximum density appears to be delayed by about
one year compared to classical activity indicators, such as the sunspot number.

real ballots of any strict subset of districts at a price corresponding to the

contrast, decoy voters are trapped into selling their ballots at a low, or even

516,The ATHENA Class of Risk-Limiting Ballot Polling Audits,"The main risk-limiting ballot polling audit in use today, BRAVO, is designed
for use when single ballots are drawn at random and a decision regarding
whether to stop the audit or draw another ballot is taken after each ballot
draw (ballot-by-ballot (B2) audits). On the other hand, real ballot polling
audits draw many ballots in a single round before determining whether to stop
(round-by-round (R2) audits). We show that BRAVO results in significant
inefficiency when directly applied to real R2 audits. We present the ATHENA
class of R2 stopping rules, which we show are risk-limiting if the round
schedule is pre-determined (before the audit begins). We prove that each rule
is at least as efficient as the corresponding BRAVO stopping rule applied at
the end of the round. We have open-source software libraries implementing most
of our results.
  We show that ATHENA halves the number of ballots required, for all state
margins in the 2016 US Presidential election and a first round with $90\%$
stopping probability, when compared to BRAVO (stopping rule applied at the end
of the round). We present simulation results supporting the 90% stopping
probability claims and our claims for the risk accrued in the first round.
Further, ATHENA reduces the number of ballots by more than a quarter for low
margins, when compared to the BRAVO stopping rule applied on ballots in
selection order. This implies that keeping track of the order when drawing
ballots R2 is not beneficial, because ATHENA is more efficient even without
information on selection order. These results are significant because current
approaches to real ballot polling election audits use the B2 BRAVO rules,
requiring about twice as much work on the part of election officials. Applying
the rules in selection order requires fewer ballots, but keeping track of the
order, and entering it into audit software, adds to the effort.",2008.02315v5,cs.CR,2020-08-05 18:47:37+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Filip Zagórski'), arxiv.Result.Author('Grant McClearn'), arxiv.Result.Author('Sarah Morin'), arxiv.Result.Author('Neal McBurnett'), arxiv.Result.Author('Poorvi L.

it does not require a ballot manifest; (2) it can be conducted independently at
different locations, rather than requiring a central authority to select the
sample from the whole population of cast ballots or requiring stratified
sampling; (3) it can start in polling places on election night, before margins
are known. If the reported margins for the 2016 U.S. Presidential election are
correct, a Bernoulli ballot-polling audit with a risk limit of 5% and a

520,Secure Remote Voting Using Paper Ballots,"Internet voting will probably be one of the most significant achievements of
the future information society. It will have an enormous impact on the election
process making it fast, reliable and inexpensive. Nonetheless, so far remote
voting is considered to be very difficult, as one has to take into account
susceptibility of the voter's PC to various cyber-attacks. As a result, most
the research effort is put into developing protocols and machines for poll-site
electronic voting. Although these solutions yield promising results, they
cannot be directly adopted to Internet voting because of secure platform
problem. However, the cryptographic components they utilize may be very useful.
This paper presents a scheme based on combination of mixnets and homomorphic
encryption borrowed from robust poll-site voting, along with techniques
recommended for remote voting -- code sheets and test ballots. The protocol
tries to minimize the trust put in voter's PC by making the voter responsible
for manual encryption of his vote. To achieve this, the voter obtains a paper
ballot that allows him to scramble the vote by performing simple operations
(lookup in a table). Creation of paper ballots, as well as decryption of votes,
is performed by a group of cooperating trusted servers. As a result, the scheme
is characterized by strong asymmetry -- all computations are carried out on the
server side. In consequence it does not require any additional hardware on the
voter's side, and offers distributed trust, receipt-freeness and verifiability.",0804.2349v1,cs.CR,2008-04-15 10:26:40+00:00,[arxiv.Result.Author('Lukasz Nitschke')],

with number of ballots in each group is called a ballot manifest. What if the
ballot manifest is not accurate? Surprisingly, even if ballots are known to be
missing from the manifest, it is not necessary to make worst-case assumptions
about those ballots--for instance, to adjust the margin by the number of
missing ballots--to ensure that the audit remains conservative. Rather, it
suffices to make worst-case assumptions about the individual randomly selected

modification to some risk-limiting audit procedures that makes them
automatically become more conservative if the ballot manifest has errors. The
modification--phantoms to evil zombies (~2EZ)--requires only an upper bound on

more than enough ballots to be audited to offset the manifest errors. This
ensures that the true risk limit remains smaller than the nominal risk limit.

In this study, we altered votes on a voter's ballot after they had made their
selections on a BMD. We then required them to examine their ballots for any
changes from the slate they used to vote. Overall accuracy was exceptionally
high. Participants saw 1440 total contests, and of those 1440, there were a
total of 4 errors, so total accuracy was 99.8%. Participants were able to
perform with near-perfect accuracy regardless of ballot length, ballot type,
number of altered races, and location of altered races. Detection performance
was extremely robust. We conclude that with proper direction and resources,
voters can be near-perfect detectors of ballot changes on printed paper ballots

real ballots of any strict subset of districts at a price corresponding to the
willingness to sell on the part of the citizens holding such ballots. By
contrast, decoy voters are trapped into selling their ballots at a low, or even
negligible, price. Blowing up the adversary's budget by introducing decoy

527,The ATHENA Class of Risk-Limiting Ballot Polling Audits,"The main risk-limiting ballot polling audit in use today, BRAVO, is designed
for use when single ballots are drawn at random and a decision regarding
whether to stop the audit or draw another ballot is taken after each ballot
draw (ballot-by-ballot (B2) audits). On the other hand, real ballot polling
audits draw many ballots in a single round before determining whether to stop
(round-by-round (R2) audits). We show that BRAVO results in significant
inefficiency when directly applied to real R2 audits. We present the ATHENA
class of R2 stopping rules, which we show are risk-limiting if the round
schedule is pre-determined (before the audit begins). We prove that each rule
is at least as efficient as the corresponding BRAVO stopping rule applied at
the end of the round. We have open-source software libraries implementing most
of our results.
  We show that ATHENA halves the number of ballots required, for all state
margins in the 2016 US Presidential election and a first round with $90\%$
stopping probability, when compared to BRAVO (stopping rule applied at the end
of the round). We present simulation results supporting the 90% stopping
probability claims and our claims for the risk accrued in the first round.
Further, ATHENA reduces the number of ballots by more than a quarter for low
margins, when compared to the BRAVO stopping rule applied on ballots in
selection order. This implies that keeping track of the order when drawing
ballots R2 is not beneficial, because ATHENA is more efficient even without
information on selection order. These results are significant because current
approaches to real ballot polling election audits use the B2 BRAVO rules,
requiring about twice as much work on the part of election officials. Applying
the rules in selection order requires fewer ballots, but keeping track of the
order, and entering it into audit software, adds to the effort.",2008.02315v5,cs.CR,2020-08-05 18:47:37+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Filip Zagórski'), arxiv.Result.Author('Grant McClearn'), arxiv.Result.Author('Sarah Morin'), arxiv.Result.Author('Neal McBurnett'), arxiv.Result.Author('Poorvi L.

Our method involves doing $k$ ""cuts"", each involving moving a random portion of
ballots from the top to the bottom of the stack, and then picking the ballot on
top. Unlike conventional methods of picking a ballot at random, $k$-cut does
not require identification numbers on the ballots or counting many ballots per
draw. We analyze how close the distribution of chosen ballots is to the uniform
distribution, and design different mitigation procedures. We show that $k=6$

justifiably high confidence that the reported results of an election are

SOBA combines three ideas: (1) publishing cast vote records (CVRs) separately
for each contest, so that anyone can verify that each reported contest outcome
is correct, if the CVRs reflect voters' intentions with sufficient accuracy;
(2) shrouding a mapping between ballots and the CVRs for those ballots to
prevent the loss of privacy that could occur otherwise; (3) assessing the
accuracy with which the CVRs reflect voters' intentions for a collection of
contests while simultaneously assessing the integrity of the shrouded mapping
between ballots and CVRs by comparing randomly selected ballots to the CVRs
that purport to represent them. Step (1) is related to work by the Humboldt
County Election Transparency Project, but publishing CVRs separately for
individual contests rather than images of entire ballots preserves privacy.
Step (2) requires a cryptographic commitment from elections officials.
Observers participate in step (3), which relies on the ""super-simple
simultaneous single-ballot risk-limiting audit."" Step (3) is designed to reveal
relatively few ballots if the shrouded mapping is proper and the CVRs
accurately reflect voter intent. But if the reported outcomes of the contests

simply choose not to attempt verification in the first place. In order to
understand this problem, we conducted an experiment in which 108 participants
participated in a mock election where the BMD displayed the voters' true
choices, but then changed a subset of those choices on the printed ballot. The
design of the printed ballot, the length of the ballot, the number of changes
that were made to the ballot, the location of those changes, and the
instructions provided to the voters were manipulated as part of the experiment.
Results indicated that of those voters who chose to examine the printed ballot,
76% detected anomalies, indicating that voters can reliably detect errors on

difficult to tell whether such a high value of overshooting from the convective
core is reliable or rather mimics other mixing processes, which took place on
the whole main sequence evolution, e.g., resulting from diffusion, rotation
etc. If the primary is already in the overall contraction phase or just after,
then the age of the system is about 13 Myr. Based on the available

influence the outcome of an election, given fixed voter preferences. We show
that there exist preference profiles over $k$ candidates such that up to $k-1$
different candidates win at different ballot lengths. We derive exact lower
bounds on the number of voters required for such profiles and provide a
construction matching the lower bound for unrestricted voter preferences.
Additionally, we characterize which sequences of winners are possible over
ballot lengths and provide explicit profile constructions achieving any
feasible winner sequence. We also examine how classic preference restrictions
influence our results--for instance, single-peakedness makes $k-1$ different
winners impossible but still allows at least $\Omega(\sqrt k)$. Finally, we
analyze a collection of 168 real-world elections, where we truncate rankings to
simulate shorter ballots. We find that shorter ballots could have changed the

printed ballot after making their selections on a Ballot Marking Device (BMD).
In this study, we altered votes on a voter's ballot after they had made their
selections on a BMD. We then required them to examine their ballots for any
changes from the slate they used to vote. Overall accuracy was exceptionally
high. Participants saw 1440 total contests, and of those 1440, there were a
total of 4 errors, so total accuracy was 99.8%. Participants were able to
perform with near-perfect accuracy regardless of ballot length, ballot type,
number of altered races, and location of altered races. Detection performance
was extremely robust. We conclude that with proper direction and resources,
voters can be near-perfect detectors of ballot changes on printed paper ballots
after voting with a BMD. This finding has significant implications for the
voting community as BMD use continues to grow. Research should now focus on
identifying administrative and behavioral methods that will prompt and
encourage voters to check their BMD-generated ballots before they drop them in
the ballot box.",2204.09780v1,cs.HC,2022-04-20 20:40:32+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Philip Kortum'), arxiv.Result.Author('Michael D. Byrne'), arxiv.Result.Author('Chidera O. Azubike'), arxiv.Result.Author('Laura E. Roty')]",

indistinguishable from real ballots. By means of a game-theoretical model, we
show that decoy ballots may not provide effective protection against a
malevolent adversary trying to buy real ballots. If the citizenry is divided
into subgroups (or districts), the adversary can construct a so-called ""Devil's
Menu"" consisting of several prices. In equilibrium, the adversary can buy the
real ballots of any strict subset of districts at a price corresponding to the
willingness to sell on the part of the citizens holding such ballots. By
contrast, decoy voters are trapped into selling their ballots at a low, or even
negligible, price. Blowing up the adversary's budget by introducing decoy
ballots may thus turn out to be futile. The Devil's Menu can also be applied to
the well-known ""Lemons Problem"".",1712.05477v1,cs.GT,2017-12-14 23:54:58+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Hans Gersbach'), arxiv.Result.Author('Akaki Mamageishvili'), arxiv.Result.Author('Oriol Tejada')]",
545,The ATHENA Class of Risk-Limiting Ballot Polling Audits,"The main risk-limiting ballot polling audit in use today, BRAVO, is designed
for use when single ballots are drawn at random and a decision regarding
whether to stop the audit or draw another ballot is taken after each ballot
draw (ballot-by-ballot (B2) audits). On the other hand, real ballot polling
audits draw many ballots in a single round before determining whether to stop
(round-by-round (R2) audits). We show that BRAVO results in significant
inefficiency when directly applied to real R2 audits. We present the ATHENA
class of R2 stopping rules, which we show are risk-limiting if the round
schedule is pre-determined (before the audit begins). We prove that each rule
is at least as efficient as the corresponding BRAVO stopping rule applied at
the end of the round. We have open-source software libraries implementing most
of our results.
  We show that ATHENA halves the number of ballots required, for all state
margins in the 2016 US Presidential election and a first round with $90\%$
stopping probability, when compared to BRAVO (stopping rule applied at the end
of the round). We present simulation results supporting the 90% stopping
probability claims and our claims for the risk accrued in the first round.
Further, ATHENA reduces the number of ballots by more than a quarter for low
margins, when compared to the BRAVO stopping rule applied on ballots in
selection order. This implies that keeping track of the order when drawing
ballots R2 is not beneficial, because ATHENA is more efficient even without
information on selection order. These results are significant because current
approaches to real ballot polling election audits use the B2 BRAVO rules,
requiring about twice as much work on the part of election officials. Applying
the rules in selection order requires fewer ballots, but keeping track of the
order, and entering it into audit software, adds to the effort.",2008.02315v5,cs.CR,2020-08-05 18:47:37+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Filip Zagórski'), arxiv.Result.Author('Grant McClearn'), arxiv.Result.Author('Sarah Morin'), arxiv.Result.Author('Neal McBurnett'), arxiv.Result.Author('Poorvi L.

counting mistakes made during audits.
  Moreover, we present and analyze a simple approximate sampling
method,""$k$-cut"", for picking a ballot randomly from a stack, without counting.
Our method involves doing $k$ ""cuts"", each involving moving a random portion of
ballots from the top to the bottom of the stack, and then picking the ballot on
top. Unlike conventional methods of picking a ballot at random, $k$-cut does
not require identification numbers on the ballots or counting many ballots per
draw. We analyze how close the distribution of chosen ballots is to the uniform
distribution, and design different mitigation procedures. We show that $k=6$

it does not require a ballot manifest; (2) it can be conducted independently at
different locations, rather than requiring a central authority to select the
sample from the whole population of cast ballots or requiring stratified
sampling; (3) it can start in polling places on election night, before margins
are known. If the reported margins for the 2016 U.S. Presidential election are
correct, a Bernoulli ballot-polling audit with a risk limit of 5% and a
sampling rate of $p_0 = 1\%$ would have had at least a 99% probability of

ballot tilings form a subset in the set of symmetric Dyck tilings, we construct
an inclusive map from labeled trees for ballot tilings to labeled trees for
symmetric Dyck tilings. By this inclusive map, the results for symmetric Dyck
tilings can be applied to those of ballot tilings. We introduce and study the
notions of ballot tableaux and tree-like tableaux of shifted shapes, which are
generalizations of Dyck tableaux and tree-like tableaux, respectively. The

justifiably high confidence that the reported results of an election are
consistent with an audit trail (""ballots""), which can be paper or electronic.
SOBA combines three ideas: (1) publishing cast vote records (CVRs) separately
for each contest, so that anyone can verify that each reported contest outcome
is correct, if the CVRs reflect voters' intentions with sufficient accuracy;
(2) shrouding a mapping between ballots and the CVRs for those ballots to
prevent the loss of privacy that could occur otherwise; (3) assessing the
accuracy with which the CVRs reflect voters' intentions for a collection of
contests while simultaneously assessing the integrity of the shrouded mapping
between ballots and CVRs by comparing randomly selected ballots to the CVRs
that purport to represent them. Step (1) is related to work by the Humboldt
County Election Transparency Project, but publishing CVRs separately for
individual contests rather than images of entire ballots preserves privacy.
Step (2) requires a cryptographic commitment from elections officials.
Observers participate in step (3), which relies on the ""super-simple
simultaneous single-ballot risk-limiting audit."" Step (3) is designed to reveal
relatively few ballots if the shrouded mapping is proper and the CVRs
accurately reflect voter intent. But if the reported outcomes of the contests

Recent studies (e.g., Bernhard, et al. 2020) suggest the verification rate is
low. What is not clear from previous research is whether this is more a result
of voters being unable to do so accurately or whether this is because voters
simply choose not to attempt verification in the first place. In order to
understand this problem, we conducted an experiment in which 108 participants
participated in a mock election where the BMD displayed the voters' true
choices, but then changed a subset of those choices on the printed ballot. The
design of the printed ballot, the length of the ballot, the number of changes
that were made to the ballot, the location of those changes, and the
instructions provided to the voters were manipulated as part of the experiment.
Results indicated that of those voters who chose to examine the printed ballot,
76% detected anomalies, indicating that voters can reliably detect errors on
their ballot if they will simply review it. This suggests that administrative

spectrum of rapidly rotating stars is a superposition of frequency subsets
associated with dynamically independent regions of the ray-dynamics phase
space. At high rotation rates corresponding to typical $\delta$ Scuti stars,
two frequency subsets are expected to be visible : a regular frequency subset
described by a Tassoul like formula and an irregular frequency subset with
specific statistical properties. In this paper, we investigate whether the
regular patterns can be detected in the resulting spectrum. We compute the
autocorrelation function of synthetic spectra where the frequencies follow the
asymptotic theory, the relative amplitudes are simply given by the modes'
disk-averaging factors, and the frequency resolution is that of a CoRoT long
run. Our first results are that (i) the detection of regular patterns strongly
depends on the ratio of regular over irregular modes, (ii) low inclination
angle configurations are more favorable than near equator-on configurations,

traditional plurality voting in which voters submit rankings over the
candidates rather than single votes. In practice, elections using IRV often
restrict the ballot length, the number of candidates a voter is allowed to rank
on their ballot. We theoretically and empirically analyze how ballot length can
influence the outcome of an election, given fixed voter preferences. We show
that there exist preference profiles over $k$ candidates such that up to $k-1$
different candidates win at different ballot lengths. We derive exact lower
bounds on the number of voters required for such profiles and provide a
construction matching the lower bound for unrestricted voter preferences.
Additionally, we characterize which sequences of winners are possible over
ballot lengths and provide explicit profile constructions achieving any
feasible winner sequence. We also examine how classic preference restrictions
influence our results--for instance, single-peakedness makes $k-1$ different
winners impossible but still allows at least $\Omega(\sqrt k)$. Finally, we
analyze a collection of 168 real-world elections, where we truncate rankings to
simulate shorter ballots. We find that shorter ballots could have changed the
outcome in one quarter of these elections. Our results highlight ballot length

560,Limiting Risk by Turning Manifest Phantoms into Evil Zombies,"Drawing a random sample of ballots to conduct a risk-limiting audit generally
requires knowing how the ballots cast in an election are organized into groups,
for instance, how many containers of ballots there are in all and how many
ballots are in each container. A list of the ballot group identifiers along
with number of ballots in each group is called a ballot manifest. What if the
ballot manifest is not accurate? Surprisingly, even if ballots are known to be
missing from the manifest, it is not necessary to make worst-case assumptions
about those ballots--for instance, to adjust the margin by the number of
missing ballots--to ensure that the audit remains conservative. Rather, it
suffices to make worst-case assumptions about the individual randomly selected
ballots that the audit cannot find. This observation provides a simple
modification to some risk-limiting audit procedures that makes them
automatically become more conservative if the ballot manifest has errors. The
modification--phantoms to evil zombies (~2EZ)--requires only an upper bound on
the total number of ballots cast. ~2EZ makes the audit P-value stochastically
larger than it would be had the manifest been accurate, automatically requiring
more than enough ballots to be audited to offset the manifest errors. This
ensures that the true risk limit remains smaller than the nominal risk limit.
On the other hand, if the manifest is in fact accurate and the upper bound on
the total number of ballots equals the total according to the manifest, ~2EZ
has no effect at all on the number of ballots audited nor on the true risk
limit.",1207.3413v1,stat.AP,2012-07-14 11:26:02+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Jorge H. Banuelos'), arxiv.Result.Author('Philip B. Stark')]",

562,"More style, less work: card-style data decrease risk-limiting audit sample sizes","U.S. elections rely heavily on computers such as voter registration
databases, electronic pollbooks, voting machines, scanners, tabulators, and
results reporting websites. These introduce digital threats to election
outcomes. Risk-limiting audits (RLAs) mitigate threats to some of these systems
by manually inspecting random samples of ballot cards. RLAs have a large chance
of correcting wrong outcomes (by conducting a full manual tabulation of a
trustworthy record of the votes), but can save labor when reported outcomes are
correct. This efficiency is eroded when sampling cannot be targeted to ballot
cards that contain the contest(s) under audit. If the sample is drawn from all
cast cards, RLA sample sizes scale like the reciprocal of the fraction of
ballot cards that contain the contest(s) under audit. That fraction shrinks as
the number of cards per ballot grows (i.e., when elections contain more
contests) and as the fraction of ballots that contain the contest decreases
(i.e., when a smaller percentage of voters are eligible to vote in the
contest). States that conduct RLAs of contests on multi-card ballots or of
small contests can dramatically reduce sample sizes by using information about
which ballot cards contain which contests -- by keeping track of card-style
data (CSD). For instance, CSD reduces the expected number of draws needed to
audit a single countywide contest on a 4-card ballot by 75%. Similarly, CSD
reduces the expected number of draws by 95% or more for an audit of two
contests with the same margin on a 4-card ballot if one contest is on every
ballot and the other is on 10% of ballots. In realistic examples, the savings

has been concerned with asymptotics. We introduce a continuous analogue of
bidirectional ballot sequences which we call bidirectional gerrymanders, and
show that the set of bidirectional gerrymanders form a convex polytope sitting
inside the unit cube, which we refer to as the bidirectional ballot polytope.
We prove that every $(2n-1)$-dimensional unit cube can be partitioned into
$2n-1$ isometric copies of the $(2n-1)$-dimensional bidirectional ballot
polytope. Furthermore, we show that the vertices of this polytope are all also
vertices of the cube, and that the vertices are in bijection with BBS's. An
immediate corollary is a geometric explanation of the result of Zhao and of
Bosquet-M{\'e}lou and Ponty that the number of BBS's of length $n$ is
$\Theta(2^n/n)$.",1708.02399v4,math.CO,2017-08-08 07:58:02+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Steven J. Miller'), arxiv.Result.Author('Carsten Peterson'), arxiv.Result.Author('Carsten Sprunger'), arxiv.Result.Author('Roger Van Peski')]",
566,Creation of ballot sequences in a periodic cellular automaton,"Motivated by an attempt to develop a method for solving initial value
problems in a class of one dimensional periodic cellular automata (CA)
associated with crystal bases and soliton equations, we consider a
generalization of a simple proposition in elementary mathematics. The original
proposition says that any sequence of letters 1 and 2, having no less 1's than
2's, can be changed into a ballot sequence via cyclic shifts only. We
generalize it to treat sequences of cells of common capacity s > 1, each of
them containing consecutive 2's (left) and 1's (right), and show that these
sequences can be changed into a ballot sequence via two manipulations, cyclic
and ""quasi-cyclic"" shifts. The latter is a new CA rule and we find that various
kink-like structures are traveling along the system like particles under the
time evolution of this rule.",0708.0705v4,nlin.SI,2007-08-06 07:31:38+00:00,[arxiv.Result.Author('Taichiro Takagi')],J. Phys. Soc. Jpn. 78 (2009) 024003

printed ballot after making their selections on a Ballot Marking Device (BMD).
In this study, we altered votes on a voter's ballot after they had made their
selections on a BMD. We then required them to examine their ballots for any
changes from the slate they used to vote. Overall accuracy was exceptionally
high. Participants saw 1440 total contests, and of those 1440, there were a
total of 4 errors, so total accuracy was 99.8%. Participants were able to
perform with near-perfect accuracy regardless of ballot length, ballot type,
number of altered races, and location of altered races. Detection performance
was extremely robust. We conclude that with proper direction and resources,
voters can be near-perfect detectors of ballot changes on printed paper ballots
after voting with a BMD. This finding has significant implications for the
voting community as BMD use continues to grow. Research should now focus on
identifying administrative and behavioral methods that will prompt and
encourage voters to check their BMD-generated ballots before they drop them in

real ballots of any strict subset of districts at a price corresponding to the
willingness to sell on the part of the citizens holding such ballots. By
contrast, decoy voters are trapped into selling their ballots at a low, or even
negligible, price. Blowing up the adversary's budget by introducing decoy

574,The ATHENA Class of Risk-Limiting Ballot Polling Audits,"The main risk-limiting ballot polling audit in use today, BRAVO, is designed
for use when single ballots are drawn at random and a decision regarding
whether to stop the audit or draw another ballot is taken after each ballot
draw (ballot-by-ballot (B2) audits). On the other hand, real ballot polling
audits draw many ballots in a single round before determining whether to stop
(round-by-round (R2) audits). We show that BRAVO results in significant
inefficiency when directly applied to real R2 audits. We present the ATHENA
class of R2 stopping rules, which we show are risk-limiting if the round
schedule is pre-determined (before the audit begins). We prove that each rule
is at least as efficient as the corresponding BRAVO stopping rule applied at
the end of the round. We have open-source software libraries implementing most
of our results.
  We show that ATHENA halves the number of ballots required, for all state
margins in the 2016 US Presidential election and a first round with $90\%$
stopping probability, when compared to BRAVO (stopping rule applied at the end
of the round). We present simulation results supporting the 90% stopping
probability claims and our claims for the risk accrued in the first round.
Further, ATHENA reduces the number of ballots by more than a quarter for low
margins, when compared to the BRAVO stopping rule applied on ballots in
selection order. This implies that keeping track of the order when drawing
ballots R2 is not beneficial, because ATHENA is more efficient even without
information on selection order. These results are significant because current
approaches to real ballot polling election audits use the B2 BRAVO rules,
requiring about twice as much work on the part of election officials. Applying
the rules in selection order requires fewer ballots, but keeping track of the
order, and entering it into audit software, adds to the effort.",2008.02315v5,cs.CR,2020-08-05 18:47:37+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Filip Zagórski'), arxiv.Result.Author('Grant McClearn'), arxiv.Result.Author('Sarah Morin'), arxiv.Result.Author('Neal McBurnett'), arxiv.Result.Author('Poorvi L.

not require identification numbers on the ballots or counting many ballots per

Recent studies (e.g., Bernhard, et al. 2020) suggest the verification rate is

of voters being unable to do so accurately or whether this is because voters
simply choose not to attempt verification in the first place. In order to
understand this problem, we conducted an experiment in which 108 participants
participated in a mock election where the BMD displayed the voters' true

design of the printed ballot, the length of the ballot, the number of changes

instructions provided to the voters were manipulated as part of the experiment.
Results indicated that of those voters who chose to examine the printed ballot,

either they support the recorded result, or they fall back to a full manual
recount. For elections with digitised scanning and counting of ballots, a
comparison audit compares randomly selected digital ballots with their paper

evidence against or in support of the recorded result. Risk-limiting audits for
first-past-the-post elections are well understood, and used in some US
elections. We define a number of approaches to ballot-polling and comparison

581,Sets of Half-Average Nulls Generate Risk-Limiting Audits: SHANGRLA,"Risk-limiting audits (RLAs) for many social choice functions can be reduced
to testing sets of null hypotheses of the form ""the average of this list is not
greater than 1/2"" for a collection of finite lists of nonnegative numbers. Such
social choice functions include majority, super-majority, plurality,
multi-winner plurality, Instant Runoff Voting (IRV), Borda count, approval
voting, and STAR-Voting, among others. The audit stops without a full hand
count iff all the null hypotheses are rejected. The nulls can be tested in many
ways. Ballot-polling is particularly simple; two new ballot-polling
risk-measuring functions for sampling without replacement are given.
Ballot-level comparison audits transform each null into an equivalent assertion
that the mean of re-scaled tabulation errors is not greater than 1/2. In turn,
that null can then be tested using the same statistical methods used for ballot
polling---but applied to different finite lists of nonnegative numbers.
SHANGRLA comparison audits are more efficient than previous comparison audits
for two reasons: (i) for most social choice functions, the conditions tested
are both necessary and sufficient for the reported outcome to be correct, while
previous methods tested conditions that were sufficient but not necessary, and
(ii) the tests avoid a conservative approximation. The SHANGRLA abstraction
simplifies stratified audits, including audits that combine ballot polling with
ballot-level comparisons, producing sharper audits than the ""SUITE"" approach.
SHANGRLA works with the ""phantoms to evil zombies"" strategy to treat missing
ballot cards and missing or redacted cast vote records. That also facilitates
sampling from ""ballot-style manifests,"" which can dramatically improve
efficiency when the audited contests do not appear on every ballot card.

582,Non(c)esuch Ballot-Level Risk-Limiting Audits for Precinct-Count Voting Systems,"Risk-limiting audits (RLAs) guarantee a high probability of correcting
incorrect reported outcomes before the outcomes are certified. The most
efficient use ballot-level comparison, comparing the voting system's
interpretation of individual ballot cards sampled at random (cast-vote records,
CVRs) from a trustworthy paper trail to a human interpretation of the same
cards. Such comparisons require the voting system to create and export CVRs in
a way that can be linked to the individual ballots the CVRs purport to
represent. Such links can be created by keeping the ballots in the order in
which they are scanned or by printing a unique serial number on each ballot.
But for precinct-count systems (PCOS), these strategies may compromise vote
anonymity: the order in which ballots are cast may identify the voters who cast
them. Printing a unique pseudo-random number (""cryptographic nonce"") on each
ballot card after the voter last touches it could reduce such privacy risks.
But what if the system does not in fact print a unique number on each ballot or
does not accurately report the numbers it printed? This paper gives two ways to
conduct an RLA so that even if the system does not print a genuine nonce on
each ballot or misreports the nonces it used, the audit's risk limit is not
compromised (however, the anonymity of votes might be compromised). One method
allows untrusted technology to be used to imprint and to retrieve ballot cards.
The method is adaptive: if the technology behaves properly, this protection
does not increase the audit workload. But if the imprinting or retrieval system
misbehaves, the sample size the RLA requires to confirm the reported results
when the results are correct is generally larger than if the imprinting and
retrieval were accurate.",2207.01362v1,cs.CR,2022-07-04 12:35:42+00:00,[arxiv.Result.Author('Philip B. Stark')],
583,Adaptive Risk-Limiting Ballot Comparison Audits,"Risk-limiting audits (RLAs) are rigorous statistical procedures meant to
detect invalid election results. RLAs examine paper ballots cast during the
election to statistically assess the possibility of a disagreement between the
winner determined by the ballots and the winner reported by tabulation. The
most ballot efficient approaches proceed by ""ballot comparison."" However,
ballot comparison requires an untrusted declaration of the contents of each
cast ballot, rather than a simple tabulation of vote totals. This ""cast-vote
record table"" (CVR) is then spot-checked against ballots for consistency. In
many practical settings, the cost of generating a suitable CVR dominates the
cost of conducting the audit, preventing widespread adoption of these
sample-efficient techniques.
  We introduce a new RLA procedure: an ""adaptive ballot comparison"" audit. In
this audit, a global CVR is never produced; instead, a three-stage procedure is
iterated:
  1) a batch is selected,
  2) a CVR is produced for that batch, and
  3) a ballot within the batch is sampled, inspected by auditors, and compared
with the CVR.
  We prove that such an audit can achieve risk commensurate with standard
comparison audits while generating a fraction of the CVR. We present three main
contributions:
  1) a formal adversarial model for RLAs;
  2) definition and analysis of an adaptive audit procedure with rigorous risk
limits and an associated correctness analysis accounting for the incidental
errors arising in typical audits; and
  3) an analysis of practical efficiency.
  This method can be organized in rounds (as is typical for comparison audits)

reported vote shares are exactly right, it can require arbitrarily large
samples when the reported reported winner(s) really won but reported vote
shares are wrong. ALPHA is a simple generalization of BRAVO that (i) works for

power for stratified audits by avoiding the need to use a $P$-value combining
function or to maximize $P$-values over nuisance parameters within strata, and
allowing adaptive sampling across strata; (iii) works not only for

586,Limiting Risk by Turning Manifest Phantoms into Evil Zombies,"Drawing a random sample of ballots to conduct a risk-limiting audit generally
requires knowing how the ballots cast in an election are organized into groups,
for instance, how many containers of ballots there are in all and how many
ballots are in each container. A list of the ballot group identifiers along
with number of ballots in each group is called a ballot manifest. What if the
ballot manifest is not accurate? Surprisingly, even if ballots are known to be
missing from the manifest, it is not necessary to make worst-case assumptions
about those ballots--for instance, to adjust the margin by the number of
missing ballots--to ensure that the audit remains conservative. Rather, it
suffices to make worst-case assumptions about the individual randomly selected
ballots that the audit cannot find. This observation provides a simple
modification to some risk-limiting audit procedures that makes them
automatically become more conservative if the ballot manifest has errors. The
modification--phantoms to evil zombies (~2EZ)--requires only an upper bound on
the total number of ballots cast. ~2EZ makes the audit P-value stochastically
larger than it would be had the manifest been accurate, automatically requiring
more than enough ballots to be audited to offset the manifest errors. This
ensures that the true risk limit remains smaller than the nominal risk limit.
On the other hand, if the manifest is in fact accurate and the upper bound on
the total number of ballots equals the total according to the manifest, ~2EZ

is used when multiple candidates need to be elected. The complexity of these
systems has made it difficult to audit the election outcomes. There is
currently no known risk-limiting audit (RLA) method for STV, other than a full
manual count of the ballots.
  A new approach to auditing these systems was recently proposed, based on a
Dirichlet-tree model. We present a detailed analysis of this approach for
ballot-polling Bayesian audits of IRV elections. We compared several choices
for the prior distribution, including some approaches using a Bayesian
bootstrap (equivalent to an improper prior). Our findings include that the
bootstrap-based approaches can be adapted to perform similarly to a full
Bayesian model in practice, and that an overly informative prior can give
counter-intuitive results. Via carefully chosen examples, we show why creating
an RLA with this model is challenging, but we also suggest ways to overcome
this.
  As well as providing a practical and computationally feasible implementation
of a Bayesian IRV audit, our work is important in laying the foundation for an
RLA for STV elections.",2209.03881v1,stat.AP,2022-09-08 15:35:50+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Floyd Everest'), arxiv.Result.Author('Michelle Blom'), arxiv.Result.Author('Philip B.

588,Boardroom Voting: Verifiable Voting with Ballot Privacy Using Low-Tech Cryptography in a Single Room,"A boardroom election is an election that takes place in a single room -- the
boardroom -- in which all voters can see and hear each other. We present an
initial exploration of boardroom elections with ballot privacy and voter
verifiability that use only ""low-tech cryptography"" without using computers to
mark or collect ballots. Specifically, we define the problem, introduce several
building blocks, and propose a new protocol that combines these blocks in novel
ways. Our new building blocks include ""foldable ballots"" that can be rotated to
hide the alignment of ballot choices with voting marks, and ""visual secrets""
that are easy to remember and use but hard to describe. Although closely seated
participants in a boardroom election have limited privacy, the protocol ensures
that no one can determine how others voted. Moreover, each voter can verify
that their ballot was correctly cast, collected, and counted, without being
able to prove how they voted, providing assurance against undue influence.
Low-tech cryptography is useful in situations where constituents do not trust
computer technology, and it avoids the complex auditing requirements of
end-to-end cryptographic voting systems such as Pr\^{e}t-\`{a}-Voter. This
paper's building blocks and protocol are meant to be a proof of concept that
might be tested for usability and improved.",2007.14916v2,cs.CR,2020-07-29 15:40:51+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Enka Blanchard'), arxiv.Result.Author('Ted Selker'), arxiv.Result.Author('Alan T. Sherman')]",
589,A Unified Evaluation of Two-Candidate Ballot-Polling Election Auditing Methods,"Counting votes is complex and error-prone. Several statistical methods have
been developed to assess election accuracy by manually inspecting randomly
selected physical ballots. Two 'principled' methods are risk-limiting audits
(RLAs) and Bayesian audits (BAs). RLAs use frequentist statistical inference
while BAs are based on Bayesian inference. Until recently, the two have been
thought of as fundamentally different.
  We present results that unify and shed light upon 'ballot-polling' RLAs and
BAs (which only require the ability to sample uniformly at random from all cast
ballot cards) for two-candidate plurality contests, which are building blocks
for auditing more complex social choice functions, including some preferential
voting systems. We highlight the connections between the methods and explore
their performance.
  First, building on a previous demonstration of the mathematical equivalence
of classical and Bayesian approaches, we show that BAs, suitably calibrated,
are risk-limiting. Second, we compare the efficiency of the methods across a
wide range of contest sizes and margins, focusing on the distribution of sample
sizes required to attain a given risk limit. Third, we outline several ways to
improve performance and show how the mathematical equivalence explains the
improvements.",2008.08536v2,stat.AP,2020-08-19 16:30:03+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Zhuoqun Huang'), arxiv.Result.Author('Ronald L. Rivest'), arxiv.Result.Author('Philip B.

transferable vote (STV), are used in many places around the world. They are
more complex than plurality and scoring rules, presenting a challenge for
auditing their outcomes: there is no known risk-limiting audit (RLA) method for
STV other than a full hand count.
  We present a new approach to auditing ranked systems that uses a statistical
model, a Dirichlet-tree, that can cope with high-dimensional parameters in a
computationally efficient manner. We demonstrate this approach with a
ballot-polling Bayesian audit for IRV elections. Although the technique is not
known to be risk-limiting, we suggest some strategies that might allow it to be
calibrated to limit risk.",2206.14605v2,stat.AP,2022-06-29 13:06:42+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Floyd Everest'), arxiv.Result.Author('Michelle Blom'), arxiv.Result.Author('Philip B.

591,Bernoulli Ballot Polling: A Manifest Improvement for Risk-Limiting Audits,"We present a method and software for ballot-polling risk-limiting audits
(RLAs) based on Bernoulli sampling: ballots are included in the sample with
probability $p$, independently. Bernoulli sampling has several advantages: (1)
it does not require a ballot manifest; (2) it can be conducted independently at
different locations, rather than requiring a central authority to select the
sample from the whole population of cast ballots or requiring stratified
sampling; (3) it can start in polling places on election night, before margins
are known. If the reported margins for the 2016 U.S. Presidential election are
correct, a Bernoulli ballot-polling audit with a risk limit of 5% and a
sampling rate of $p_0 = 1\%$ would have had at least a 99% probability of
confirming the outcome in 42 states. (The other states were more likely to have
needed to examine additional ballots.) Logistical and security advantages that
auditing in the polling place affords may outweigh the cost of examining more
ballots than some other methods might require.",1812.06361v1,stat.AP,2018-12-15 21:57:23+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Kellie Ottoboni'), arxiv.Result.Author('Matthew Bernhard'), arxiv.Result.Author('J.

592,$k$-Cut: A Simple Approximately-Uniform Method for Sampling Ballots in Post-Election Audits,"We present an approximate sampling framework and discuss how risk-limiting
audits can compensate for these approximations, while maintaining their
""risk-limiting"" properties. Our framework is general and can compensate for
counting mistakes made during audits.
  Moreover, we present and analyze a simple approximate sampling
method,""$k$-cut"", for picking a ballot randomly from a stack, without counting.
Our method involves doing $k$ ""cuts"", each involving moving a random portion of
ballots from the top to the bottom of the stack, and then picking the ballot on
top. Unlike conventional methods of picking a ballot at random, $k$-cut does
not require identification numbers on the ballots or counting many ballots per
draw. We analyze how close the distribution of chosen ballots is to the uniform
distribution, and design different mitigation procedures. We show that $k=6$
cuts is enough for an risk-limiting election audit, based on empirical data,
which would provide a significant increase in efficiency.",1811.08811v3,cs.DS,2018-11-21 16:26:33+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Mayuri Sridhar'), arxiv.Result.Author('Ronald L. Rivest')]",
593,Can Voters Detect Errors on Their Printed Ballots? Absolutely,"There is still debate on whether voters can detect malicious changes in their
printed ballot after making their selections on a Ballot Marking Device (BMD).
In this study, we altered votes on a voter's ballot after they had made their
selections on a BMD. We then required them to examine their ballots for any
changes from the slate they used to vote. Overall accuracy was exceptionally
high. Participants saw 1440 total contests, and of those 1440, there were a
total of 4 errors, so total accuracy was 99.8%. Participants were able to
perform with near-perfect accuracy regardless of ballot length, ballot type,
number of altered races, and location of altered races. Detection performance
was extremely robust. We conclude that with proper direction and resources,
voters can be near-perfect detectors of ballot changes on printed paper ballots
after voting with a BMD. This finding has significant implications for the
voting community as BMD use continues to grow. Research should now focus on
identifying administrative and behavioral methods that will prompt and
encourage voters to check their BMD-generated ballots before they drop them in
the ballot box.",2204.09780v1,cs.HC,2022-04-20 20:40:32+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Philip Kortum'), arxiv.Result.Author('Michael D. Byrne'), arxiv.Result.Author('Chidera O. Azubike'), arxiv.Result.Author('Laura E. Roty')]",
594,"More style, less work: card-style data decrease risk-limiting audit sample sizes","U.S. elections rely heavily on computers such as voter registration
databases, electronic pollbooks, voting machines, scanners, tabulators, and
results reporting websites. These introduce digital threats to election
outcomes. Risk-limiting audits (RLAs) mitigate threats to some of these systems
by manually inspecting random samples of ballot cards. RLAs have a large chance
of correcting wrong outcomes (by conducting a full manual tabulation of a
trustworthy record of the votes), but can save labor when reported outcomes are
correct. This efficiency is eroded when sampling cannot be targeted to ballot
cards that contain the contest(s) under audit. If the sample is drawn from all
cast cards, RLA sample sizes scale like the reciprocal of the fraction of
ballot cards that contain the contest(s) under audit. That fraction shrinks as
the number of cards per ballot grows (i.e., when elections contain more
contests) and as the fraction of ballots that contain the contest decreases
(i.e., when a smaller percentage of voters are eligible to vote in the
contest). States that conduct RLAs of contests on multi-card ballots or of
small contests can dramatically reduce sample sizes by using information about
which ballot cards contain which contests -- by keeping track of card-style
data (CSD). For instance, CSD reduces the expected number of draws needed to
audit a single countywide contest on a 4-card ballot by 75%. Similarly, CSD
reduces the expected number of draws by 95% or more for an audit of two
contests with the same margin on a 4-card ballot if one contest is on every
ballot and the other is on 10% of ballots. In realistic examples, the savings
can be several orders of magnitude.",2012.03371v1,cs.CR,2020-12-06 20:35:12+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Amanda K. Glazer'), arxiv.Result.Author('Jacob V. Spertus'), arxiv.Result.Author('Philip B. Stark')]",
595,Fundraising and vote distribution: a non-equilibrium statistical approach,"The number of votes correlates strongly with the money spent in a campaign,
but the relation between the two is not straightforward. Among other factors,
the output of a ballot depends on the number of candidates, voters, and
available resources. Here, we develop a conceptual framework based on Shannon
entropy maximization and Superstatistics to establish a relation between the
distributions of money spent by candidates and their votes. By establishing
such a relation, we provide a tool to predict the outcome of a ballot and to
alert for possible misconduct either in the report of fundraising and spending
of campaigns or on vote counting. As an example, we consider real data from a
proportional election with $6323$ candidates, where a detailed data
verification is virtually impossible, and show that the number of potential
misconducting candidates to audit can be reduced to only nine.",1810.01936v1,physics.soc-ph,2018-10-03 19:54:22+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('H. P. M. Melo'), arxiv.Result.Author('N. A. M. Araujo'), arxiv.Result.Author('J. S. Andrade Jr')]",
596,Ballot stuffing and participation privacy in pollsite voting,"We study the problem of simultaneously addressing both ballot stuffing and
participation privacy for pollsite voting systems. Ballot stuffing is the
attack where fake ballots (not cast by any eligible voter) are inserted into
the system. Participation privacy is about hiding which eligible voters have
actually cast their vote. So far, the combination of ballot stuffing and
participation privacy has been mostly studied for internet voting, where voters
are assumed to own trusted computing devices. Such approaches are inapplicable
to pollsite voting where voters typically vote bare handed. We present an
eligibility audit protocol to detect ballot stuffing in pollsite voting
protocols. This is done while protecting participation privacy from a remote
observer - one who does not physically observe voters during voting. Our
protocol can be instantiated as an additional layer on top of most existing
pollsite E2E-V voting protocols. To achieve our guarantees, we develop an
efficient zero-knowledge proof (ZKP), that, given a value $v$ and a set $\Phi$
of commitments, proves $v$ is committed by some commitment in $\Phi$, without
revealing which one. We call this a ZKP of reverse set membership because of
its relationship to the popular ZKPs of set membership. This ZKP may be of
independent interest.",2210.14833v1,cs.CR,2022-10-26 16:29:23+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Prashant Agrawal'), arxiv.Result.Author('Abhinav Nakarmi'), arxiv.Result.Author('Mahabir Prasad Jhanwar'), arxiv.Result.Author('Subodh Sharma'), arxiv.Result.Author('Subhashis Banerjee')]",

598,Risk-Limiting Audits by Stratified Union-Intersection Tests of Elections (SUITE),"Risk-limiting audits (RLAs) offer a statistical guarantee: if a full manual
tally of the paper ballots would show that the reported election outcome is
wrong, an RLA has a known minimum chance of leading to a full manual tally.
RLAs generally rely on random samples. Stratified sampling--partitioning the
population of ballots into disjoint strata and sampling independently from the
strata--may simplify logistics or increase efficiency compared to simpler
sampling designs, but makes risk calculations harder. We present SUITE, a new
method for conducting RLAs using stratified samples. SUITE considers all
possible partitions of outcome-changing error across strata. For each
partition, it combines P-values from stratum-level tests into a combined
P-value; there is no restriction on the tests used in different strata. SUITE
maximizes the combined P-value over all partitions of outcome-changing error.
The audit can stop if that maximum is less than the risk limit. Voting systems
in some Colorado counties (comprising 98.2% of voters) allow auditors to check
how the system interpreted each ballot, which allows ballot-level comparison
RLAs. Other counties use ballot polling, which is less efficient. Extant
approaches to conducting an RLA of a statewide contest would require major
changes to Colorado's procedures and software, or would sacrifice the
efficiency of ballot-level comparison. SUITE does not. It divides ballots into
two strata: those cast in counties that can conduct ballot-level comparisons,
and the rest. Stratum-level P-values are found by methods derived here. The
resulting audit is substantially more efficient than statewide ballot polling.
SUITE is useful in any state with a mix of voting systems or that uses
stratified sampling for other reasons. We provide an open-source reference
implementation and exemplar calculations in Jupyter notebooks.",1809.04235v1,stat.AP,2018-09-12 02:56:22+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Kellie Ottoboni'), arxiv.Result.Author('Philip B. Stark'), arxiv.Result.Author('Mark Lindeman'), arxiv.Result.Author('Neal McBurnett')]",
599,On the Distortion of Voting with Multiple Representative Candidates,"We study positional voting rules when candidates and voters are embedded in a
common metric space, and cardinal preferences are naturally given by distances
in the metric space. In a positional voting rule, each candidate receives a
score from each ballot based on the ballot's rank order; the candidate with the
highest total score wins the election. The cost of a candidate is his sum of
distances to all voters, and the distortion of an election is the ratio between
the cost of the elected candidate and the cost of the optimum candidate. We
consider the case when candidates are representative of the population, in the
sense that they are drawn i.i.d. from the population of the voters, and analyze
the expected distortion of positional voting rules.
  Our main result is a clean and tight characterization of positional voting
rules that have constant expected distortion (independent of the number of
candidates and the metric space). Our characterization result immediately
implies constant expected distortion for Borda Count and elections in which
each voter approves a constant fraction of all candidates. On the other hand,
we obtain super-constant expected distortion for Plurality, Veto, and approving
a constant number of candidates. These results contrast with previous results
on voting with metric preferences: When the candidates are chosen
adversarially, all of the preceding voting rules have distortion linear in the
number of candidates or voters. Thus, the model of representative candidates
allows us to distinguish voting rules which seem equally bad in the worst case.",1711.07600v1,cs.GT,2017-11-21 01:51:25+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Yu Cheng'), arxiv.Result.Author('Shaddin Dughmi'), arxiv.Result.Author('David Kempe')]",
