0,PROVIDENCE: a Flexible Round-by-Round Risk-Limiting Audit,"A Risk-Limiting Audit (RLA) is a statistical election tabulation audit with a
rigorous error guarantee. We present ballot polling RLA PROVIDENCE, an audit
with the efficiency of MINERVA and flexibility of BRAVO. We prove that
PROVIDENCE is risk-limiting in the presence of an adversary who can choose
subsequent round sizes given knowledge of previous samples. We describe a
measure of audit workload as a function of the number of rounds, precincts
touched, and ballots drawn.We quantify the problem of obtaining a misleading
audit sample when rounds are too small, demonstrating the importance of the
resulting constraint on audit planning. We present simulation results
demonstrating the superiority of PROVIDENCE using these measures and describing
an approach to planning audit round schedules.
  We describe the use of PROVIDENCE by the Rhode Island Board of Elections in a
tabulation audit of the 2021 election. Our implementation of PROVIDENCE and
audit planning tools in the open source R2B2 library should be useful to the
states of Georgia and Pennsylvania, which are planning pre-certification ballot
polling RLAs for the 2022 general election.",2210.08717v1,['cs.CR'],2022-10-17 03:14:46+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Oliver Broadrick'), arxiv.Result.Author('Poorvi L. Vora'), arxiv.Result.Author('Filip Zagórski')]"
1,Non(c)esuch Ballot-Level Risk-Limiting Audits for Precinct-Count Voting Systems,"Risk-limiting audits (RLAs) guarantee a high probability of correcting
incorrect reported outcomes before the outcomes are certified. The most
efficient use ballot-level comparison, comparing the voting system's
interpretation of individual ballot cards sampled at random (cast-vote records,
CVRs) from a trustworthy paper trail to a human interpretation of the same
cards. Such comparisons require the voting system to create and export CVRs in
a way that can be linked to the individual ballots the CVRs purport to
represent. Such links can be created by keeping the ballots in the order in
which they are scanned or by printing a unique serial number on each ballot.
But for precinct-count systems (PCOS), these strategies may compromise vote
anonymity: the order in which ballots are cast may identify the voters who cast
them. Printing a unique pseudo-random number (""cryptographic nonce"") on each
ballot card after the voter last touches it could reduce such privacy risks.
But what if the system does not in fact print a unique number on each ballot or
does not accurately report the numbers it printed? This paper gives two ways to
conduct an RLA so that even if the system does not print a genuine nonce on
each ballot or misreports the nonces it used, the audit's risk limit is not
compromised (however, the anonymity of votes might be compromised). One method
allows untrusted technology to be used to imprint and to retrieve ballot cards.
The method is adaptive: if the technology behaves properly, this protection
does not increase the audit workload. But if the imprinting or retrieval system
misbehaves, the sample size the RLA requires to confirm the reported results
when the results are correct is generally larger than if the imprinting and
retrieval were accurate.",2207.01362v1,"['cs.CR', 'stat.AP']",2022-07-04 12:35:42+00:00,[arxiv.Result.Author('Philip B. Stark')]
2,Conservative statistical post-election audits,"There are many sources of error in counting votes: the apparent winner might
not be the rightful winner. Hand tallies of the votes in a random sample of
precincts can be used to test the hypothesis that a full manual recount would
find a different outcome. This paper develops a conservative sequential test
based on the vote-counting errors found in a hand tally of a simple or
stratified random sample of precincts. The procedure includes a natural
escalation: If the hypothesis that the apparent outcome is incorrect is not
rejected at stage $s$, more precincts are audited. Eventually, either the
hypothesis is rejected--and the apparent outcome is confirmed--or all precincts
have been audited and the true outcome is known. The test uses a priori bounds
on the overstatement of the margin that could result from error in each
precinct. Such bounds can be derived from the reported counts in each precinct
and upper bounds on the number of votes cast in each precinct. The test allows
errors in different precincts to be treated differently to reflect voting
technology or precinct sizes. It is not optimal, but it is conservative: the
chance of erroneously confirming the outcome of a contest if a full manual
recount would show a different outcome is no larger than the nominal
significance level. The approach also gives a conservative $P$-value for the
hypothesis that a full manual recount would find a different outcome, given the
errors found in a fixed size sample. This is illustrated with two contests from
November, 2006: the U.S. Senate race in Minnesota and a school board race for
the Sausalito Marin City School District in California, a small contest in
which voters could vote for up to three candidates.",0807.4005v1,['stat.AP'],2008-07-25 06:54:40+00:00,[arxiv.Result.Author('Philip B. Stark')]
3,Decentralized Verifiable Mail-in Ballot Counting for Postal Voting,"As computer vision is prevalently used for mail-in ballot processing and
counting, it becomes a point of centralized trust in postal voting. We propose
DVote, a prototype system of postal voting that provides decentralized trust in
computer vision. With blockchain and layer-2 technologies, DVote decentralizes
the computation and model training of computer vision to a group of scrutineers
that hold the AnyTrust assumption, i.e., at least one member is honest.
Consequently, the computational integrity is anchored to the trustworthiness of
a large public blockchain such as Ethereum.",2202.09122v1,['cs.CR'],2022-02-18 11:00:10+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Peichen Xie'), arxiv.Result.Author('Zihan Zheng'), arxiv.Result.Author('Xian Zhang'), arxiv.Result.Author('Shuo Chen')]"
4,Physical Cryptographic Signatures for Absentee Ballots,"Physical signature verification on absentee ballots became a major flashpoint
in the 2018 midterm elections in the United States, especially in states like
Georgia, Florida, and Arizona, where close election margins resulted in
heightened attention to the counting of absentee ballots. As vote-by-mail
solutions are becoming more prevalent across the U.S., these issues are sure to
continue affecting elections in the United States. Signature verification is an
inexact science; often times guidelines can vary widely from jurisdiction to
jurisdiction. In this paper we provide a cryptographic remedy to this solution
that is usable, secure, and easily integrated into existing election
infrastructure.",1812.09423v1,['cs.CR'],2018-12-22 00:43:31+00:00,[arxiv.Result.Author('Matthew Bernhard')]
5,Security Survey and Analysis of Vote-by-Mail Systems,"Voting by mail has been gaining traction for decades in the United States and
has emerged as the preferred voting method during the COVID-19 pandemic. In
this paper, we examine the security of electronic systems used in the process
of voting by mail, including online voter registration and online ballot
tracking systems. The goals of these systems, to facilitate voter registration
and increase public confidence in elections, are laudable. They indisputably
provide a critical public good. It is for these reasons that understanding the
security and privacy posture of the mail-in voting process is paramount. We
find that online voter registration systems in some states have vulnerabilities
that allow adversaries to alter or effectively prevent a voter's registration.
We additionally find that ballot tracking systems raise serious privacy
questions surrounding ease of access to voter data. While the vulnerabilities
discussed here are unlikely to enable an adversary to modify votes, several
could have the effect of disenfranchising voters and reducing voter confidence
in U.S. elections infrastructure, thereby undermining the very purpose of these
systems.",2005.08427v2,"['cs.CY', 'cs.CR']",2020-05-18 02:18:15+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Jenny Blessing'), arxiv.Result.Author('Julian Gomez'), arxiv.Result.Author('McCoy Patiño'), arxiv.Result.Author('Tran Nguyen')]"
6,Blind proxy voting,"A secret ballot mechanism that enables voting in absence is proposed. It
amends standard vote collection methods that use ballot box as anonymizer,
adding the option for absent voters to vote by a proxy blinded to the content
of the ballot paper. Votes are cast under unique and hidden identification
numbers generated solely for the purpose of that election. Voters prepare their
ballot papers from scratch and submit them to the tallying authority in two
parts via separate routes, each part being meaningless without the other.",1812.11128v1,['cs.CR'],2018-12-28 17:41:13+00:00,[arxiv.Result.Author('Zuzana Haniková')]
7,RemoteVote and SAFE Vote: Towards Usable End-to-End Verification for Vote-by-Mail,"Postal voting is growing rapidly in the U.S., with 43% of voters casting
ballots by mail in 2020, yet until recently there has been little research
about extending the protections of end-to-end verifiable (E2E-V) election
schemes to vote-by-mail contexts. The first - and to date, only - framework to
focus on this setting is STROBE, which has important usability limitations. In
this work, we present two approaches, RemoteVote and SAFE Vote, that allow
mail-in voters to benefit from E2E-V without changing the voter experience for
those who choose not to participate in verification. To evaluate these systems
and compare them with STROBE, we consider an expansive set of properties,
including novel attributes of usability and verifiability, several of which
have applicability beyond vote-by-mail contexts. We hope that our work will
help catalyze further progress towards universal applicability of E2E-V for
real-world elections.",2111.08662v3,['cs.CR'],2021-11-16 17:49:54+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Braden L. Crimmins'), arxiv.Result.Author('Marshall Rhea'), arxiv.Result.Author('J. Alex Halderman')]"
8,Precinct Size Matters - The Large Precinct Bias in US Presidential Elections,"Examination of precinct level data in US presidential elections reveals a
correlation of large precincts and increased fraction of Republican votes. The
large precinct bias is analyzed with respect to voter heterogeneity and voter
inconvenience as precinct size increases. The analysis shows that voter
inconvenience is a significant factor in election outcomes in certain states,
and may significantly disadvantage Democratic candidates.",1410.8868v1,"['stat.OT', '91F10 (primary), 91D10 (secondary)']",2014-10-29 17:58:15+00:00,[arxiv.Result.Author('Glenn Webb')]
9,"More style, less work: card-style data decrease risk-limiting audit sample sizes","U.S. elections rely heavily on computers such as voter registration
databases, electronic pollbooks, voting machines, scanners, tabulators, and
results reporting websites. These introduce digital threats to election
outcomes. Risk-limiting audits (RLAs) mitigate threats to some of these systems
by manually inspecting random samples of ballot cards. RLAs have a large chance
of correcting wrong outcomes (by conducting a full manual tabulation of a
trustworthy record of the votes), but can save labor when reported outcomes are
correct. This efficiency is eroded when sampling cannot be targeted to ballot
cards that contain the contest(s) under audit. If the sample is drawn from all
cast cards, RLA sample sizes scale like the reciprocal of the fraction of
ballot cards that contain the contest(s) under audit. That fraction shrinks as
the number of cards per ballot grows (i.e., when elections contain more
contests) and as the fraction of ballots that contain the contest decreases
(i.e., when a smaller percentage of voters are eligible to vote in the
contest). States that conduct RLAs of contests on multi-card ballots or of
small contests can dramatically reduce sample sizes by using information about
which ballot cards contain which contests -- by keeping track of card-style
data (CSD). For instance, CSD reduces the expected number of draws needed to
audit a single countywide contest on a 4-card ballot by 75%. Similarly, CSD
reduces the expected number of draws by 95% or more for an audit of two
contests with the same margin on a 4-card ballot if one contest is on every
ballot and the other is on 10% of ballots. In realistic examples, the savings
can be several orders of magnitude.",2012.03371v1,"['cs.CR', 'stat.ME']",2020-12-06 20:35:12+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Amanda K. Glazer'), arxiv.Result.Author('Jacob V. Spertus'), arxiv.Result.Author('Philip B. Stark')]"

11,Limiting Risk by Turning Manifest Phantoms into Evil Zombies,"Drawing a random sample of ballots to conduct a risk-limiting audit generally
requires knowing how the ballots cast in an election are organized into groups,
for instance, how many containers of ballots there are in all and how many
ballots are in each container. A list of the ballot group identifiers along
with number of ballots in each group is called a ballot manifest. What if the
ballot manifest is not accurate? Surprisingly, even if ballots are known to be
missing from the manifest, it is not necessary to make worst-case assumptions
about those ballots--for instance, to adjust the margin by the number of
missing ballots--to ensure that the audit remains conservative. Rather, it
suffices to make worst-case assumptions about the individual randomly selected
ballots that the audit cannot find. This observation provides a simple
modification to some risk-limiting audit procedures that makes them
automatically become more conservative if the ballot manifest has errors. The
modification--phantoms to evil zombies (~2EZ)--requires only an upper bound on
the total number of ballots cast. ~2EZ makes the audit P-value stochastically
larger than it would be had the manifest been accurate, automatically requiring
more than enough ballots to be audited to offset the manifest errors. This
ensures that the true risk limit remains smaller than the nominal risk limit.
On the other hand, if the manifest is in fact accurate and the upper bound on
the total number of ballots equals the total according to the manifest, ~2EZ
has no effect at all on the number of ballots audited nor on the true risk
limit.",1207.3413v1,['stat.AP'],2012-07-14 11:26:02+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Jorge H. Banuelos'), arxiv.Result.Author('Philip B. Stark')]"
12,A Complete Enumeration of Ballot Permutations Avoiding Sets of Small Patterns,"Permutations whose prefixes contain at least as many ascents as descents are
called ballot permutations. Lin, Wang, and Zhao have previously enumerated
ballot permutations avoiding small patterns and have proposed the problem of
enumerating ballot permutations avoiding a pair of permutations of length $3$.
We completely enumerate ballot permutations avoiding two patterns of length $3$
and we relate these avoidance classes with their respective recurrence
relations and formulas, which leads to an interesting bijection between ballot
permutations avoiding $132$ and $312$ with left factors of Dyck paths. In
addition, we also conclude the Wilf-classification of ballot permutations
avoiding sets of two patterns of length $3$, and we then extend our results to
completely enumerate ballot permutations avoiding three patterns of length $3$.",2209.06087v1,"['math.CO', '05A05']",2022-09-13 15:37:45+00:00,[arxiv.Result.Author('Nathan Sun')]
13,Can Voters Detect Errors on Their Printed Ballots? Absolutely,"There is still debate on whether voters can detect malicious changes in their
printed ballot after making their selections on a Ballot Marking Device (BMD).
In this study, we altered votes on a voter's ballot after they had made their
selections on a BMD. We then required them to examine their ballots for any
changes from the slate they used to vote. Overall accuracy was exceptionally
high. Participants saw 1440 total contests, and of those 1440, there were a
total of 4 errors, so total accuracy was 99.8%. Participants were able to
perform with near-perfect accuracy regardless of ballot length, ballot type,
number of altered races, and location of altered races. Detection performance
was extremely robust. We conclude that with proper direction and resources,
voters can be near-perfect detectors of ballot changes on printed paper ballots
after voting with a BMD. This finding has significant implications for the
voting community as BMD use continues to grow. Research should now focus on
identifying administrative and behavioral methods that will prompt and
encourage voters to check their BMD-generated ballots before they drop them in
the ballot box.",2204.09780v1,"['cs.HC', 'cs.CR', 'H.1.2; J.4']",2022-04-20 20:40:32+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Philip Kortum'), arxiv.Result.Author('Michael D. Byrne'), arxiv.Result.Author('Chidera O. Azubike'), arxiv.Result.Author('Laura E. Roty')]"
14,Ballot tilings and increasing trees,"We study enumerations of Dyck and ballot tilings, which are tilings of a
region determined by two Dyck or ballot paths. We give bijective proofs to two
formulae of enumerations of Dyck tilings through Hermite histories. We show
that one of the formulae is equal to a certain Kazhdan--Lusztig polynomial. For
a ballot tiling, we establish formulae which are analogues of formulae for Dyck
tilings. Especially, the generating functions have factorized expressions. The
key tool is a planted plane tree and its increasing labellings. We also
introduce a generalized perfect matching which is bijective to an Hermite
history for a ballot tiling. By combining these objects, we obtain various
expressions of a generating function of ballot tilings with a fixed lower path.",1705.06434v1,"['math-ph', 'math.CO', 'math.MP']",2017-05-18 06:46:09+00:00,[arxiv.Result.Author('Keiichi Shigechi')]
15,Sophisticated Attacks on Decoy Ballots: The Devil's Menu and the Market for Lemons,"Decoy ballots do not count in election outcomes, but otherwise they are
indistinguishable from real ballots. By means of a game-theoretical model, we
show that decoy ballots may not provide effective protection against a
malevolent adversary trying to buy real ballots. If the citizenry is divided
into subgroups (or districts), the adversary can construct a so-called ""Devil's
Menu"" consisting of several prices. In equilibrium, the adversary can buy the
real ballots of any strict subset of districts at a price corresponding to the
willingness to sell on the part of the citizens holding such ballots. By
contrast, decoy voters are trapped into selling their ballots at a low, or even
negligible, price. Blowing up the adversary's budget by introducing decoy
ballots may thus turn out to be futile. The Devil's Menu can also be applied to
the well-known ""Lemons Problem"".",1712.05477v1,['cs.GT'],2017-12-14 23:54:58+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Hans Gersbach'), arxiv.Result.Author('Akaki Mamageishvili'), arxiv.Result.Author('Oriol Tejada')]"
16,The ATHENA Class of Risk-Limiting Ballot Polling Audits,"The main risk-limiting ballot polling audit in use today, BRAVO, is designed
for use when single ballots are drawn at random and a decision regarding
whether to stop the audit or draw another ballot is taken after each ballot
draw (ballot-by-ballot (B2) audits). On the other hand, real ballot polling
audits draw many ballots in a single round before determining whether to stop
(round-by-round (R2) audits). We show that BRAVO results in significant
inefficiency when directly applied to real R2 audits. We present the ATHENA
class of R2 stopping rules, which we show are risk-limiting if the round
schedule is pre-determined (before the audit begins). We prove that each rule
is at least as efficient as the corresponding BRAVO stopping rule applied at
the end of the round. We have open-source software libraries implementing most
of our results.
  We show that ATHENA halves the number of ballots required, for all state
margins in the 2016 US Presidential election and a first round with $90\%$
stopping probability, when compared to BRAVO (stopping rule applied at the end
of the round). We present simulation results supporting the 90% stopping
probability claims and our claims for the risk accrued in the first round.
Further, ATHENA reduces the number of ballots by more than a quarter for low
margins, when compared to the BRAVO stopping rule applied on ballots in
selection order. This implies that keeping track of the order when drawing
ballots R2 is not beneficial, because ATHENA is more efficient even without
information on selection order. These results are significant because current
approaches to real ballot polling election audits use the B2 BRAVO rules,
requiring about twice as much work on the part of election officials. Applying
the rules in selection order requires fewer ballots, but keeping track of the
order, and entering it into audit software, adds to the effort.",2008.02315v5,"['cs.CR', 'stat.AP']",2020-08-05 18:47:37+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Filip Zagórski'), arxiv.Result.Author('Grant McClearn'), arxiv.Result.Author('Sarah Morin'), arxiv.Result.Author('Neal McBurnett'), arxiv.Result.Author('Poorvi L.

17,$k$-Cut: A Simple Approximately-Uniform Method for Sampling Ballots in Post-Election Audits,"We present an approximate sampling framework and discuss how risk-limiting
audits can compensate for these approximations, while maintaining their
""risk-limiting"" properties. Our framework is general and can compensate for
counting mistakes made during audits.
  Moreover, we present and analyze a simple approximate sampling
method,""$k$-cut"", for picking a ballot randomly from a stack, without counting.
Our method involves doing $k$ ""cuts"", each involving moving a random portion of
ballots from the top to the bottom of the stack, and then picking the ballot on
top. Unlike conventional methods of picking a ballot at random, $k$-cut does
not require identification numbers on the ballots or counting many ballots per
draw. We analyze how close the distribution of chosen ballots is to the uniform
distribution, and design different mitigation procedures. We show that $k=6$
cuts is enough for an risk-limiting election audit, based on empirical data,
which would provide a significant increase in efficiency.",1811.08811v3,['cs.DS'],2018-11-21 16:26:33+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Mayuri Sridhar'), arxiv.Result.Author('Ronald L. Rivest')]"
18,Bernoulli Ballot Polling: A Manifest Improvement for Risk-Limiting Audits,"We present a method and software for ballot-polling risk-limiting audits
(RLAs) based on Bernoulli sampling: ballots are included in the sample with
probability $p$, independently. Bernoulli sampling has several advantages: (1)
it does not require a ballot manifest; (2) it can be conducted independently at
different locations, rather than requiring a central authority to select the
sample from the whole population of cast ballots or requiring stratified
sampling; (3) it can start in polling places on election night, before margins
are known. If the reported margins for the 2016 U.S. Presidential election are
correct, a Bernoulli ballot-polling audit with a risk limit of 5% and a
sampling rate of $p_0 = 1\%$ would have had at least a 99% probability of
confirming the outcome in 42 states. (The other states were more likely to have
needed to examine additional ballots.) Logistical and security advantages that
auditing in the polling place affords may outweigh the cost of examining more
ballots than some other methods might require.",1812.06361v1,['stat.AP'],2018-12-15 21:57:23+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Kellie Ottoboni'), arxiv.Result.Author('Matthew Bernhard'), arxiv.Result.Author('J.

19,"Symmetric Dyck tilings, ballot tableaux and tree-like tableaux of shifted shapes","Symmetric Dyck tilings and ballot tilings are certain tilings in the region
surrounded by two ballot paths. We study the relations of combinatorial objects
which are bijective to symmetric Dyck tilings such as labeled trees, Hermite
histories, and perfect matchings. We also introduce two operations on labeled
trees for symmetric Dyck tilings: symmetric Dyck tiling strip (symDTS) and
symmetric Dyck tiling ribbon (symDTR). We give two definitions of Hermite
histories for symmetric Dyck tilings, and show that they are equivalent by use
of the correspondence between symDTS operation and an Hermite history. Since
ballot tilings form a subset in the set of symmetric Dyck tilings, we construct
an inclusive map from labeled trees for ballot tilings to labeled trees for
symmetric Dyck tilings. By this inclusive map, the results for symmetric Dyck
tilings can be applied to those of ballot tilings. We introduce and study the
notions of ballot tableaux and tree-like tableaux of shifted shapes, which are
generalizations of Dyck tableaux and tree-like tableaux, respectively. The
correspondence between ballot tableaux and tree-like tableaux of shifted shapes
is given by using the symDTR operation and the structure of labeled trees for
symmetric Dyck tilings.",2011.07296v1,"['math.CO', 'math-ph', 'math.MP']",2020-11-14 13:15:14+00:00,[arxiv.Result.Author('Keiichi Shigechi')]
20,Reputation-Driven Voting Dynamics,"We introduce the reputational voter model (RVM) to account for the
time-varying abilities of individuals to influence their neighbors. To
understand of the RVM, we first discuss the fitness voter model (FVM), in which
each voter has a fixed and distinct fitness. In a voting event where voter $i$
is fitter than voter $j$, only $j$ changes opinion. We show that the dynamics
of the FVM and the voter model are identical. We next discuss the adaptive
voter model (AVM), in which the influencing voter in a voting event increases
its fitness by a fixed amount. The dynamics of the AVM is non-stationary and
slowly crosses over to that of FVM because of the gradual broadening of the
fitness distribution of the population. Finally, we treat the RVM, in which the
voter $i$ is endowed with a reputational rank $r_i$ that ranges from 1 (highest
rank) to $N$ (lowest), where $N$ is the population size. In a voting event in
which voter $i$ outranks $j$, only the opinion of $j$ changes. Concomitantly,
the rank of $i$ increases, while that of $j$ does not change. The rank
distribution remains uniform on the integers $1,2,3,\ldots,N$, leading to
stationary dynamics. For equal number of voters in the two voting states with
these two subpopulations having the same average rand, the time to reach
consensus in the mean-field limit scales as $\exp(\sqrt{N})$. This long
consensus time arises because the average rank of the minority population is
typically higher than that of the majority. Thus whenever consensus is
approached, this highly ranked minority tends to drive the population away from
consensus.",1902.09371v2,"['physics.soc-ph', 'cond-mat.stat-mech']",2019-02-22 18:19:16+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('D. Bhat'), arxiv.Result.Author('S. Redner')]"
21,Gerrymandering: A Briber's Perspective,"We initiate the study of bribery problem in the context of gerrymandering and
reverse gerrymandering. In our most general problem, the input is a set of
voters having votes over a set of alternatives, a graph on the voters, a
partition of voters into connected districts, cost of every voter for changing
her district, a budget for the briber, and a favorite alternative of the
briber. The briber needs to compute if the given partition can be modified so
that (i) the favorite alternative of the briber wins the resulting election,
(ii) the modification is budget feasible, and (iii) every new district is
connected. We study four natural variants of the above problem -- the graph on
voter being arbitrary vs complete graph (corresponds to removing connectedness
requirement for districts) and the cost of bribing every voter being uniform vs
non-uniform. We show that all the four problems are NP-complete even under
quite restrictive scenarios. Hence our results show that district based
elections are quite resistant under this new kind of electoral attack. We
complement our hardness results with polynomial time algorithms in some other
cases.",1909.01583v1,"['cs.GT', 'cs.DS', 'cs.MA', 'cs.SI']",2019-09-04 07:21:15+00:00,[arxiv.Result.Author('Palash Dey')]

on regular topologies with local interactions, the voter model on small-world
networks does not display the emergence of complete order in the thermodynamic
limit. The system settles in a stationary state with coexisting opinions whose
lifetime diverges with the system size. Hence the nontrivial connectivity
pattern leads to the counterintuitive conclusion that long-range connections
inhibit the ordering process. However, for networks of finite size, for which
full uniformity is reached, the ordering process takes a time shorter than on a

updating and the imitation updating discovered by Ohtsuki, Hauert, Lieberman
and Nowak [Nature 441 (2006) 502-505]. Each rule specifies a payoff-ratio
cutoff point for the magnitude of fixation probabilities of the underlying
evolutionary game between cooperators and defectors. We view the Markov chains
associated with the two updating mechanisms as voter model perturbations. Then
we present a first-order approximation for fixation probabilities of general
voter model perturbations on finite graphs subject to small perturbation in
terms of the voter model fixation probabilities. In the context of regular
graphs, we obtain algebraically explicit first-order approximations for the
fixation probabilities of cooperators distributed as certain uniform
distributions. These approximations lead to a rigorous proof that both of the
rules of Ohtsuki et al. are valid and are sharp.",1107.1513v3,['math.PR'],2011-07-07 20:28:41+00:00,[arxiv.Result.Author('Yu-Ting Chen')]
26,Fluctuation versus fixation in the one-dimensional constrained voter model,"The constrained voter model describes the dynamics of opinions in a
population of individuals located on a connected graph. Each agent is
characterized by her opinion, where the set of opinions is represented by a
finite sequence of consecutive integers, and each pair of neighbors, as defined
by the edge set of the graph, interact at a constant rate. The dynamics depends
on two parameters: the number of opinions denoted by $F$ and a so-called
confidence threshold denoted by $\theta$. If the opinion distance between two
interacting agents exceeds the confidence threshold then nothing happens,
otherwise one of the two agents mimics the other one just as in the classical
voter model. Our main result shows that the one-dimensional system starting
from any product measures with a positive density of each opinion fluctuates
and clusters if and only if $F \leq 2 \theta + 1$. Sufficient conditions for
fixation in one dimension when the initial distribution is uniform and lower
bounds for the probability of consensus for the process on finite connected
graphs are also proved.",1310.0401v1,"['math.PR', '60K35']",2013-10-01 17:30:12+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Nicolas Lanchier'), arxiv.Result.Author('Stylianos Scarlatos')]"
27,How Likely A Coalition of Voters Can Influence A Large Election?,"For centuries, it has been widely believed that the influence of a small
coalition of voters is negligible in a large election. Consequently, there is a
large body of literature on characterizing the asymptotic likelihood for an
election to be influenced, especially by the manipulation of a single voter,
establishing an $O(\frac{1}{\sqrt n})$ upper bound and an
$\Omega(\frac{1}{n^{67}})$ lower bound for many commonly studied voting rules
under the i.i.d.~uniform distribution, known as Impartial Culture (IC) in
social choice, where $n$ is the number is voters.
  In this paper, we extend previous studies in three aspects: (1) we consider a
more general and realistic semi-random model, where a distribution adversary
chooses a worst-case distribution and then a data adversary modifies up to
$\psi$ portion of the data, (2) we consider many coalitional influence
problems, including coalitional manipulation, margin of victory, and various
vote controls and bribery, and (3) we consider arbitrary and variable coalition
size $B$. Our main theorem provides asymptotically tight bounds on the
semi-random likelihood of the existence of a size-$B$ coalition that can
successfully influence the election under a wide range of voting rules.
Applications of the main theorem and its proof techniques resolve long-standing
open questions about the likelihood of coalitional manipulability under IC, by
showing that the likelihood is $\Theta\left(\min\left\{\frac{B}{\sqrt n},
1\right\}\right)$ for many commonly studied voting rules.
  The main technical contribution is a characterization of the semi-random
likelihood for a Poisson multinomial variable (PMV) to be unstable, which we
believe to be a general and useful technique with independent interest.",2202.06411v2,"['econ.TH', 'cs.AI', 'cs.GT']",2022-02-13 21:27:22+00:00,[arxiv.Result.Author('Lirong Xia')]
28,On the probability of a Condorcet winner among a large number of alternatives,"Consider $2k-1$ voters, each of which has a preference ranking between $n$
given alternatives. An alternative $A$ is called a Condorcet winner, if it wins
against every other alternative $B$ in majority voting (meaning that for every
other alternative $B$ there are at least $k$ voters who prefer $A$ over $B$).
The notion of Condorcet winners has been studied intensively for many decades,
yet some basic questions remain open. In this paper, we consider a model where
each voter chooses their ranking randomly according to some probability
distribution among all rankings. One may then ask about the probability to have
a Condorcet winner with these randomly chosen rankings (which, of course,
depends on $n$ and $k$, and the underlying probability distribution on the set
of rankings). In the case of the uniform probability distribution over all
rankings, which has received a lot of attention and is often referred to as the
setting of an ""impartial culture"", we asymptotically determine the probability
of having a Condorcet winner for a fixed number $2k-1$ of voters and $n$
alternatives with $n\to \infty$. This question has been open for around fifty
years. While some authors suggested that the impartial culture should exhibit
the lowest possible probability of having a Condorcet winner, in fact the
probability can be much smaller for other distributions. We determine, for all
values of $n$ and $k$, the smallest possible probability of having a Condorcet
winner (and give an example of a probability distribution over all rankings
which achieves this minimum possible probability).",2203.13713v1,"['econ.TH', 'math.CO']",2022-03-25 15:32:08+00:00,[arxiv.Result.Author('Lisa Sauermann')]
29,E-Voting with Blockchain: An E-Voting Protocol with Decentralisation and Voter Privacy,"Technology has positive impacts on many aspects of our social life. Designing
a 24hour globally connected architecture enables ease of access to a variety of
resources and services. Furthermore, technology like Internet has been a
fertile ground for innovation and creativity. One of such disruptive innovation
is blockchain -- a keystone of cryptocurrencies. The blockchain technology is
presented as a game changer for many of the existing and emerging
technologies/services. With its immutability property and decentralised
architecture, it is taking centre stage in many services as an equalisation
factor to the current parity between consumers and large
corporations/governments. One of such potential applications of the blockchain
is in e-voting schemes. The objective of such a scheme would be to provide a
decentralised architecture to run and support a voting scheme that is open,
fair and independently verifiable. In this paper, we propose potentially a new
e-voting protocol that utilises the blockchain as a transparent ballot box. The
protocol has been designed with adhering to the fundamental e-voting properties
in mind as well as offering a degree of decentralisation and allowing for the
voter to change/update their vote (within the permissible voting period). The
paper highlights the pros and cons of using blockchain for such a proposal from
practical point view in both development/deployment and usage contexts.
Concluding the paper with a potential roadmap for blockchain technology to be
able to support complex applications.",1805.10258v2,"['cs.CR', 'cs.CY']",2018-05-25 17:18:25+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Freya Sheer Hardwick'), arxiv.Result.Author('Apostolos Gioulis'), arxiv.Result.Author('Raja Naeem Akram'), arxiv.Result.Author('Konstantinos Markantonakis')]"
